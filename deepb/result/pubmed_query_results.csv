HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The D519G Polymorphism of Glyceronephosphate O-Acyltransferase Is a Risk Factor for Familial Porphyria Cutanea Tarda.	PloS one		3.06	Both familial and sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) are iron dependent diseases. Symptoms of PCT resolve when iron stores are depleted by phlebotomy, and a sequence variant of HFE (C282Y, c.843G>A, rs1800562) that enhances iron aborption by reducing hepcidin expression is a risk factor for PCT. Recently, a polymorphic variant (D519G, c.1556A>G, rs11558492) of glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) was shown to be enriched in male patients with type I hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE C282Y homozygotes) who presented with a high iron phenotype, suggesting that GNPAT D519G, like HFE C282Y, is a modifier of iron homeostasis that favors iron absorption. To challenge this hypothesis, we investigated the frequency of GNPAT D519G in patients with both familial and sporadic PCT. Patients were screened for GNPAT D519G and allelic variants of HFE (both C282Y and H63D). Nucleotide sequencing of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) identified mutant alleles. Patients with low erythrocyte URO-D activity or a damaging URO-D variant were classified as familial PCT (fPCT) and those with wild-type URO-D were classified as sporadic PCT (sPCT). GNPAT D519G was significantly enriched in the fPCT patient population (p = 0.0014) but not in the sPCT population (p = 0.4477). Both HFE C282Y and H63D (c.187C>G, rs1799945) were enriched in both PCT patient populations (p<0.0001) but showed no greater association with fPCT than with sPCT. GNPAT D519G is a risk factor for fPCT, but not for sPCT.	27661980
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutation and iron overload in Egyptian pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors: a single-center study.	Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	2017	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations have a role in iron overload in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors. We aimed to evaluate the genotype frequency and allelic distribution of the two HFE gene mutations (C282Y and H63D) in a sample of Egyptian pediatric ALL survivors and to detect the impact of these two mutations on their iron profile. This study was performed on 35 ALL survivors during their follow-up visits to the Hematology and Oncology Unit, Pediatric Department, Menoufia University Hospitals. Thirty-five healthy children of matched age and sex were chosen as controls. After completing treatment course, ALL survivors were screened for the prevalence of these two mutations by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Serum ferritin levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique (ELISA). C282Y mutation cannot be detected in any of the 35 survivors or the 35 controls. The H63D heterozygous state (CG) was detected in 28.6% of the survivors group and in 20% of controls, while the H63D homozygous (GG) state was detected in 17.1% of survivors. No compound heterozygosity (C282Y/H63D) was detected at both groups with high G allele frequency (31.4%) in survivors more than controls (10%). There were significant higher levels of iron parameters in homozygote survivors than heterozygotes and the controls. H63D mutation aggravates the iron overload status in pediatric ALL survivors.	28211293
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Therapeutic venesection at the Australian Red Cross Blood Service: impact of the High Ferritin Application on management of hereditary haemochromatosis.	Australian family physician	2015	0.76	Therapeutic venesection is an established treatment for hereditary haemochromatosis. The C282Y homozygotes and C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes are the most likely human haemochromatosis protein (HFE) variants to cause iron over-load. The principal indications for treatment include iron overload, which is detected through measurement of hepatic iron concentration or a liver biopsy, or suspected iron-overload on the basis of elevated serum ferritin levels. Venesection is not indicated for other HFE genetic variants or in patients with isolated hyperferritinaemia in the absence of the main HFE gene mutations. The Australian Red Cross Blood Service provides a therapeutic venesection program. Since January 2013, referral has been conducted electronically using the novel, web-based High Ferritin Application. The aim of this article is to provide information regarding implementation of the High Ferritin Application and document its im-pact on referral patterns. This referral process is based on nationally endorsed, evidence-based algorithms, which have markedly reduced the number of unnecessary therapeutic venesections. An estimated 4000 unnecessary venesections are averted each year and this equates to a saving of $1.4 million.	26510149
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The bronze kidney: membranous glomerulonephritis associated with iron overload.	BMJ case reports	2015	0.5	A 55-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia developed increasing peripheral oedema over the course of several months. He was found to have nephrotic range proteinuria (15.7 g/24 h). His renal ultrasound scan was normal and the autoimmune screen was negative. His renal biopsy demonstrated evidence of membranous glomerulonephritis and increased iron deposition. At this juncture, a serum ferritin was checked which showed an initial value 933 µg/L with transferrin saturation at 96.6%. A subsequent liver biopsy also showed evidence of iron overload but without fibrotic changes. Genetic studies including C282Y HFE, ferroportin and DMT1 studies were also negative. He was subsequently treated with interval venesection which was associated with significant symptomatic and biochemical evidence of improvement in oedema and proteinuria.	25687703
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Non-HFE iron overload as a surrogate marker of disease severity in patients of liver cirrhosis.	Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology	2016	0.5	Decompensated liver cirrhosis is an important cause of mortality worldwide. Various modifiable and non-modifiable factors are involved in the pathogenesis of cirrhosis and its complications. This study was aimed to evaluate the association of iron overload and disease severity in patients of liver cirrhosis and its association with HFE gene mutation. Forty-nine patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis were recruited. Clinical and laboratory parameters were compared in patients with and without iron overload. C282Y and H63D gene mutation analysis was performed in all patients with iron overload. Iron overload was found in 20 (40.82%) patients. A significant positive correlation of transferrin saturation with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score (r = 0.705, p < 0.001) and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (r = 0.668, p < 0.001) was found. Transferrin saturation was also independently associated with high CTP and MELD score on multivariate analysis. Mortality over 3 months was significantly more common in iron-overloaded patients (p = 0.028). C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity was not found in any of the patients with iron overload. Iron overload was significantly associated with disease severity and reduced survival in patients of decompensated liver cirrhosis.	26873085
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE Variants and the Expression of Iron-Related Proteins in Breast Cancer-Associated Lymphocytes and Macrophages.	Cancer microenvironment : official journal of the International Cancer Microenvironment Society	2016	0.5	The association of HFE (High Iron FE) major variants with breast cancer risk and behavior has been a matter of discussion for a long time. However, their impact on the expression of iron-related proteins in the breast cancer tissue has never been addressed. In the present study, hepcidin, ferroportin 1, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), and ferritin expressions, as well as tissue iron deposition were evaluated in a collection of samples from breast cancers patients and analyzed according to the patients' HFE genotype. Within the group of patients with invasive carcinoma, those carrying the p.Cys282Tyr variant in heterozygosity presented a higher expression of hepcidin in lymphocytes and macrophages than wild-type or p.His63Asp carriers. An increased expression of TfR1 was also observed in all the cell types analyzed but only in p.Cys282Tyr/p.His63Asp compound heterozygous patients. A differential impact of the two HFE variants was further noticed with the observation of a significantly higher percentage of p.Cys282Tyr heterozygous patients presenting tissue iron deposition in comparison to p.His63Asp heterozygous. In the present cohort, no significant associations were found between HFE variants and classical clinicopathological markers of breast cancer behavior and prognosis. Although limited by a low sampling size, our results provide a new possible explanation for the previously reported impact of HFE major variants on breast cancer progression, i.e., not by influencing systemic iron homeostasis but rather by differentially modulating the local cellular expression of iron-related proteins and tissue iron deposition.	28028679
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Worse Outcomes of Patients With HFE Hemochromatosis With Persistent Increases in Transferrin Saturation During Maintenance Therapy.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2017	7.68	Even if patients with hemochromatosis maintain low serum levels of ferritin, they still have an increased risk of general and joint symptoms, which reduce quality of life. This could be related to persistently increased transferrin saturation. We assessed whether duration of exposure to increased transferrin saturation during maintenance therapy is associated with more severe general and joint symptoms. We performed a longitudinal cohort study of 266 individuals homozygous for the C282Y substitution in HFE, seen at a tertiary reference center in Rennes, France, and followed for 3 or more years after initial iron removal. Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were measured at the same time points; values were used to calculate duration of exposure to serum ferritin 50 μg/l or more (FRT50exp) and to determine transferrin saturation 50% or greater (SAT50exp). Clinical and biochemical follow-up data were recorded from log books completed during maintenance therapy. The primary outcome was change in general and joint symptoms, determined from answers to a self-administered questionnaire. Patients were followed for 13.5±5.9 years. FRT50exp (3.2±3.5 years) and SAT50exp (4.5±3.4 years) values correlated (r=0.38; P<.0001), but each associated with different variables in multivariate analysis, We found independent associations, regardless of follow-up time, between SAT50exp ≥6 years and worsened joint symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 4.19; 95% CI, 1.88-9.31), as well as between SAT50exp ≥6 years and decreased athletic ability (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.16-4.73). SAT50exp ≥8 years associated independently with decreased work ability (OR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.40-7.30) and decreased libido (OR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.56-7.80). In a longitudinal study of patients treated for hemochromatosis, we associated duration of exposure to increased transferrin saturation (longer than 6 years) with more severe general and joint symptoms. Maintenance of serum levels of ferritin at 50 μg/l or less does not indicate control of transferrin saturation, so guidelines on the management of hemochromatosis require revision.	28111337
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE p.C282Y gene variant is associated with varicose veins in Russian population.	Clinical and experimental medicine	2016	2.85	Recently, the association of polymorphism rs1800562 (p.C282Y) in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene with the increased risk of venous ulceration was shown. We hypothesized that HFE gene polymorphism might be involved not only in ulceration process, but also in susceptibility to primary varicose veins. We genotyped HFE p.C282Y (rs1800562) and p.H63D (rs1799945) variants in patients with primary varicose veins (n = 463) and in the control group (n = 754). In our study, p.282Y variant (rs1800562 A allele) was significantly associated with the risk of varicose veins (OR 1.79, 95 % CI = 1.11-2.89, P = 0.02). A borderline significant reverse association of p.63D variant (rs1799945 G allele) with venous leg ulcer development was revealed in Russians (OR 0.25, 95 % CI = 0.06-1.00, P = 0.05), but not in the meta-analysis (P = 0.56). We conclude that the HFE gene polymorphism can affect the risk of developing primary varicose veins.	26416403
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	C282Y/H63D hemochromatosis mutations and microevolution: Speculations concerning the Basque population.	Homo : internationale Zeitschrift fur die vergleichende Forschung am Menschen	2016	0.5	The Basques live at the Western extremity of the Pyrenees. According to linguistic and genetic data they could be considered as one of the most ancient European populations. Numerous studies have evidenced particular patterns in the frequency of several genetic polymorphisms in this relatively unmixed human group. We discuss herein the puzzling distribution of the two major hemochromatosis HFE mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. Thus, one can observe a low frequency of C282Y and, in contrast, one of the highest European frequencies of H63D. Genetic drift (enhanced by the long history and the small size of this population), long persistence of Paleolithic iron-rich diet, lower exposure to major infectious threats and limited mixing with both Celts and Vikings (who demonstrate the highest prevalence of C282Y) could be the underlying factors explaining these particular genetic features. Historical and environmental data represent key elements for understanding the role of the different evolutionary forces which shape the genetic profile of human populations.	28034447
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Cost-Effectiveness of Different Population Screening Strategies for Hereditary Haemochromatosis in Australia.	Applied health economics and health policy	2016	0.5	Amongst populations of northern European ancestry, HFE-associated haemochromatosis is a common genetic disorder characterised by iron overload. In the absence of treatment, excess iron is stored in parenchymal tissues, causing morbidity and mortality. Population screening programmes may increase early diagnosis and reduce associated disease. No contemporary health economic evaluation has been published for Australia. The objective of this study was to identify cost-effective screening strategies for haemochromatosis in the Australian setting. A Markov model using probabilistic decision analysis was developed comparing four adult screening strategies: the status quo (cascade and incidental screening), genotyping with blood and buccal samples and transferrin saturation followed by genotyping (TfS). Target populations were males (30 years) and females (45 years) of northern European ancestry. Cost-effectiveness was estimated from the government perspective over a lifetime horizon. All strategies for males were cost-effective compared to the status quo. The incremental costs (standard deviation) associated with genotyping (blood) were AUD7 (56), TfS AUD15 (45) and genotyping (buccal) AUD63 (56), producing ICERs of AUD1673, 4103 and 15,233/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively. For females, only the TfS strategy was cost-effective, producing an ICER of AUD10,195/QALY gained. Approximately 3% of C282Y homozygotes were estimated to be identified with the status quo approach, compared with 40% with the proposed screening strategies. This model estimated that genotyping and TfS strategies are likely to be more cost-effective screening strategies than the status quo.	28035629
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron and restless legs syndrome: treatment, genetics and pathophysiology.	Sleep medicine	2017	3.34	In this article, we review the original findings from MRI and autopsy studies that demonstrated brain iron status is insufficient in individuals with restless legs syndrome (RLS). The concept of deficient brain iron status is supported by proteomic studies from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and from the clinical findings where intervention with iron, either dietary or intravenous, can improve RLS symptoms. Therefore, we include a section on peripheral iron status and how peripheral status may influence both the RLS symptoms and treatment strategy. Given the impact of iron in RLS, we have evaluated genetic data to determine if genes are directly involved in iron regulatory pathways. The result was negative. In fact, even the HFE mutation C282Y could not be shown to have a protective effect. Lastly, a consistent finding in conditions of low iron is increased expression of proteins in the hypoxia pathway. Although there is lack of clinical data that RLS patients are hypoxic, there are intriguing observations that environmental hypoxic conditions worsen RLS symptoms; in this chapter we review very compelling data for activation of hypoxic pathways in the brain in RLS patients. In general, the data in RLS point to a pathophysiology that involves decreased acquisition of iron by cells in the brain. Whether the decreased ability is genetically driven, activation of pathways (eg, hypoxia) that are designed to limit cellular uptake is unknown at this time; however, the data strongly support a functional rather than structural defect in RLS, suggesting that an effective treatment is possible.	28057495
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Whole genome sequencing of one complex pedigree illustrates challenges with genomic medicine.	BMC medical genomics	2017	2.73	Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) has risen as a useful tool for precision medicine by providing a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities to describe presentations of human pathologies; however, there have been relatively few reports combining whole genome sequencing (WGS) and HPO, especially in the context of structural variants. We illustrate an integrative analysis of WGS and HPO using an extended pedigree, which involves Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), and dysautonomia-like symptoms. A comprehensive WGS pipeline was used to ensure reliable detection of genomic variants. Beyond variant filtering, we pursued phenotypic prioritization of candidate genes using Phenolyzer. Regarding PWS, WGS confirmed a 5.5 Mb de novo deletion of the parental allele at 15q11.2 to 15q13.1. Phenolyzer successfully returned the diagnosis of PWS, and pinpointed clinically relevant genes in the deletion. Further, Phenolyzer revealed how each of the genes is linked with the phenotypes represented by HPO terms. For HH, WGS identified a known disease variant (p.C282Y) in HFE of an affected female. Analysis of HPO terms alone fails to provide a correct diagnosis, but Phenolyzer successfully revealed the phenotype-genotype relationship using a disease-centric approach. Finally, Phenolyzer also revealed the complexity behind dysautonomia-like symptoms, and seven variants that might be associated with the phenotypes were identified by manual filtering based on a dominant inheritance model. The integration of WGS and HPO can inform comprehensive molecular diagnosis for patients, eliminate false positives and reveal novel insights into undiagnosed diseases. Due to extreme heterogeneity and insufficient knowledge of human diseases, it is also important that phenotypic and genomic data are standardized and shared simultaneously.	28228131
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum Ferritin Concentration Predicts Hepatic Fibrosis Better than Hepatic Iron Concentration in Human HFE-Hemochromatosis.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2017	4.47	Ferritin is purported to have proinflammatory and profibrogenic effects on hepatic stellate cells. Thus, rather than acting as a passive indicator of hepatic iron concentration (HIC) in hemochromatosis, ferritin may directly influence fibrosis. This study evaluated whether serum ferritin is a better predictor of hepatic fibrosis compared to variables previously associated with increased fibrosis risk in hemochromatosis. We identified 291 C282Y HFE-homozygous patients who had undergone liver biopsy for histological fibrosis staging and measurement of HIC. Ordinal logistic regression determined the best model for fibrosis stage not including serum ferritin. Then, serum ferritin was introduced into this model to assess whether the predictive power of the model was significantly increased and to evaluate the effect on other predictors of fibrosis. Ordinal logistic regression analyses without serum ferritin demonstrated that log HIC (OR 2.89; P<0.001), male gender (OR 2.93; P=0.005), alcohol consumption (g/day) (OR 1.01; P=0.004), steatosis (OR 2.86; P=0.01), arthritis (OR 2.46; P=0.01) predicted increasing fibrosis stage (n=217). Addition of serum ferritin in multivariate analysis substantially improved the predictive power of the model (χ 2 =37.15; P<0.01) and was highly predictive of fibrosis stage (OR 5.44; P<0.001). Inclusion of serum ferritin in this model rendered the effects of HIC, gender, alcohol and steatosis to non-significance. In hemochromatosis, serum ferritin is a better predictor of fibrosis stage than HIC, gender, steatosis and alcohol. These data support a hypothesis that ferritin may play a role in fibrosis rather than simply acting as a passive indicator of iron storage. This article is protected by copyright.

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Novel loci affecting iron homeostasis and their effects in individuals at risk for hemochromatosis.	Nature communications	2014	11.33	Variation in body iron is associated with or causes diseases, including anaemia and iron overload. Here, we analyse genetic association data on biochemical markers of iron status from 11 European-population studies, with replication in eight additional cohorts (total up to 48,972 subjects). We find 11 genome-wide-significant (P<5 × 10(-8)) loci, some including known iron-related genes (HFE, SLC40A1, TF, TFR2, TFRC, TMPRSS6) and others novel (ABO, ARNTL, FADS2, NAT2, TEX14). SNPs at ARNTL, TF, and TFR2 affect iron markers in HFE C282Y homozygotes at risk for hemochromatosis. There is substantial overlap between our iron loci and loci affecting erythrocyte and lipid phenotypes. These results will facilitate investigation of the roles of iron in disease.	25352340
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE p.C282Y homozygosity predisposes to rapid serum ferritin rise after menopause: a genotype-stratified cohort study of hemochromatosis in Australian women.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2016	3.32	"""Women who are homozygous for the p.C282Y mutation in the HFE gene are at much lower risk of iron overload-related disease than p.C282Y homozygous men, presumably due to the iron-depleting effects of menstruation and pregnancy. We used data from a population cohort study to model the impact of menstruation cessation at menopause on serum ferritin (SF) levels in female p.C282Y homozygotes, with p.C282Y/p.H63D simple or compound heterozygotes and those with neither p.C282Y nor p.H63D mutations (HFE wild-types) as comparison groups. A sample of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) was selected for the """"HealthIron"""" study (n = 1,438) including all HFE p.C282Y homozygotes plus a random sample stratified by HFE-genotype (p.C282Y and p.H63D). The relationship between the natural logarithm of SF and time since menopause was examined using linear mixed models incorporating spline smoothing. For p.C282Y homozygotes, SF increased by a factor of 3.6 (95% CI (1.8, 7.0), p < 0.001) during the first ten years post menopause, after which SF continued to increase but at less than half the previous rate. In contrast, SF profiles for other HFE genotype groups increase more gradually and did not show a distinction between pre- and post-menopausal SF levels. Only p.C282Y homozygotes had predicted SF exceeding 200 µg/L post-menopause, but the projected SF did not increase the risk of iron-overload related disease. These data provide the first documented evidence that physiological blood loss is a major factor in determining the marked gender difference in expression of p.C282Y homozygosity.

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	GNPAT p.D519G is independently associated with markedly increased iron stores in HFE p.C282Y homozygotes.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2017	0.5	GNPAT p.D519G positivity is significantly increased in HFE p.C282Y homozygotes with markedly increased iron stores. We sought to determine associations of p.D519G and iron-related variables with iron stores in p.C282Y homozygotes. We defined markedly increased iron stores as serum ferritin >2247pmol/L (>1000μg/L) and either hepatic iron >236μmol/g dry weight or iron >10g by induction phlebotomy (men and women). We defined normal or mildly elevated iron stores as serum ferritin <674.1pmol/L (<300μg/L) or either age≥40y with iron ≤2.5g iron by induction phlebotomy or age≥50y with ≤3.0g iron by induction phlebotomy (men only). We compared participant subgroups using univariate methods. Using multivariable logistic regression, we evaluated associations of markedly increased iron stores with these variables: age; iron supplement use (dichotomous); whole blood units donated; erythrocyte units received as transfusion; daily alcohol consumption, g; and p.D519G positivity (heterozygosity or homozygosity). The mean age of 56 participants (94.6% men) was 55±10 (SD) y; 41 had markedly increased iron stores. Prevalences of swollen/tender 2nd/3rd metacarpophalangeal joints and elevated aspartate or alanine aminotransferase were significantly greater in participants with markedly increased iron stores. Only participants with markedly increased iron stores had cirrhosis. In multivariable analyses, p.D519G positivity was the only exposure variable significantly associated with markedly increased iron stores (odds ratio 9.9, 95% CI [1.6, 60.3], p=0.0126). GNPAT p.D519G is strongly associated with markedly increased iron stores in p.C282Y homozygotes after correction for age, iron-related variables, and alcohol consumption.	27936396
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Evaluation of a high throughput method for the detection of mutations associated with thrombosis and hereditary hemochromatosis in Brazilian blood donors.	PloS one	2015	3.06	The aim of this study was to evaluate the OpenArray platform for genetic testing of blood donors and to assess the genotype frequencies of nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with venous thrombosis (G1691A and G20210A), hyperhomocysteinemia (C677T, A1298C), and hereditary hemochromatosis (C282Y, H63D and S65C) in blood donors from Sao Paulo, Brazil. We examined 400 blood donor samples collected from October to November 2011. The SNPs were detected using OpenArray technology. The blood samples were also examined using a real-time PCR-FRET system to compare the results and determine the accuracy of the OpenArray method. We observed 100% agreement in all assays tested, except HFE C282Y, which showed 99.75% agreement. The HFE C282Y assay was further confirmed through direct sequencing, and the results showed that OpenArray analysis was accurate. The calculated frequencies of each SNP were FV G1691A 98.8% (G/G), 1.2% (G/A); FII G2021A 99.5% (G/G), 0.5% (G/A); MTHFR C677T 45.5% (C/C), 44.8% (C/T), 9.8% (T/T); MTHFR A1298C 60.3% (A/A), 33.6% (A/C), 6.1% (C/C); HFE C282Y 96%(G/G), 4%(G/A), HFE H63D 78.1%(C/C), 20.3% (C/G), 1.6% (G/G); and HFE S65C 98.1% (A/A), 1.9% (A/T). Taken together, these results describe the frequencies of SNPs associated with diseases and are important to enhance our current knowledge of the genetic profiles of Brazilian blood donors, although a larger study is needed for a more accurate determination of the frequency of the alleles. Furthermore, the OpenArray platform showed a high concordance rate with standard FRET RT-PCR.	25955572
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Movement Disorders Associated With Hemochromatosis.	The Canadian journal of neurological sciences. Le journal canadien des sciences neurologiques	2016	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic disorder causing pathological iron deposition and functional impairment of various organs, predominantly the liver. We assessed patients with HH for the presence of movement disorders. We reviewed the charts of 616 patients with HH who attended hemochromatosis clinic at London Health Sciences Centre, London, ON, Canada, from 1988 to 2015. We found three HH patients with movement disorders, without any other major systemic manifestation. One had parkinsonism, another had chorea, and the third had tremor. All three patients had evidence of iron deposition in the brain, affecting the basal ganglia in the first two, and the dentate nucleus, red nucleus, and substantia nigra in the third patient. In addition to the C282Y homozygous mutation in the HFE gene, two of our patients had non-HFE gene mutations. HH should be considered in the differential diagnosis of movement disorders with pathological brain iron deposition. We report for the first time chorea in a patient with HH. Non-HFE gene mutations may predispose HH patients to iron deposition in the brain.	27827297

Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2017	0.5	The major histocompatibility complex is linked to white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts in subjects unselected for HFE genotypes. We compared age, sex, body mass index, total WBC and subtypes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils) (Beckman Coulter® Gen-S), transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin of HFE p.C282Y and wild-type (p.C282Y, p.H63D negative) homozygotes without acquired conditions that influence WBC counts. We performed regressions on WBC and subtypes. There were 161 p.C282Y homozygotes (45.3% men) and 221 wild-type homozygotes (40.3% men). Mean WBC of men and women and between HFE genotypes were similar. Mean lymphocytes were higher in male p.C282Y homozygotes: 1.6×10 9 /L [95% confidence interval: 1.5,1.7] vs. 1.4 [1.3,1.5], p=0.0002. Mean lymphocytes and basophils were higher in female p.C282Y homozygotes: 1.6 [1.5,1.7] vs. 1.4 [1.3,1.5], p=0.0002; and 0.065 [0.059,0.071] vs. 0.052 [0.051,0.054], p=0.0001, respectively. Transferrin saturation was associated with neutrophils (negative; p=0.0163). Age was associated with lymphocytes (negative; p=0.0003) and monocytes (positive; p<0.0001). Regressions on lymphocytes and basophils revealed positive associations with p.C282Y homozygosity (p=0.0043 and 0.0003, respectively). There were significant positive associations of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. We conclude that HFE p.C282Y homozygosity is significantly associated with lymphocyte and basophil counts.	27915113
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genetic variability and risk of alcoholic liver disease: A meta-analysis.	Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Medical sciences = Hua zhong ke ji da xue xue bao. Yi xue Ying De wen ban = Huazhong keji daxue xuebao. Yixue Yingdewen ban	2016	0.5	Studies examining the association of hemochromatosis (HFE) gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) yielded inconsistent results. Thus, we performed a metaanalysis to investigate whether the variations in HFE gene increase the risk of ALD. The studies published up to Feb. 2014 were identified by searching PubMed/MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases, which was complemented by screening the references of the retrieved studies. For all genotypes and alleles, the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to the heterogeneity were pooled using fixed-effect model. Sixteen studies with 1933 cases and 9874 controls were included for this meta-analysis. C282Y/C282Y, C282Y/wild type, H63D/wild type and C282Y/H63D were found not to be associated with susceptibility to ALD, but increased risk of H63D/H63D (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.05-2.22, P=0.029) was observed for ALD when compared to total control. Comparison of ALD patients with alcoholics without liver damage revealed a significant association of D allele, as well as a marginal association of H63D/wild type with ALD, while H63D/H63D was not significantly associated with ALD although increased value of OR was obtained. The presence of Y allele and other genotypes yielded insignificant findings when ALD patients were compared with alcoholics without liver damage. No evident publication bias or significant heterogeneity among studies was detected in this meta-analysis. In conclusion, our metaanalysis showed a marginal higher prevalence of H63D variant in ALD but did not support an increased risk of C282Y mutation.	27752890
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Meta-Analysis of the Association between H63D and C282Y Polymorphisms in HFE and Cancer Risk.	Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP	2015	0.5	Previous studies suggested that the H63D and C282Y polymorphisms in the HFE genes were susceptible to many cancer types, nevertheless, the present results were inconclusive. Thus, the present study was aimed to evaluate the association between the HFE polymorphisms (H63D and C282Y) and cancer risk via meta-analysis. We retrieved PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase and Web of Science databases for all eligible studies up to April 1, 2015. All the statistical analysis was conducted by STATA 12.0. Finally, a total of 20 publications including 24 case-control studies, comprising 6,524 cases and 31,080 controls for HFE-C282Y polymorphism and 19 publications including 21 case control studies, comprising 5,648 cases and 14,257 controls for HFE-H63D polymorphism were enrolled in our analysis. An increased risk for overall cancer risk was identified in HFE-H63D polymorphism under allele contrast (D vs H: OR=1.153; 95%CI=1.031- 1.289, Pheterogeneity=0.002), homozygotes vs wide type (DD vs HH: OR=1.449; 95%CI=1.182-1.777, Pheterogeneity=0.391), dominant model (DD+HD vs HH: OR=1.145; 95%CI=1.007-1.301, Pheterogeneity=0.002) and recessive model (DD vs HD+HH: OR=1.416 ; 95%CI=1.156-1.735, Pheterogeneity=0.549), as well as HFE- C282Y under homozygotes vs wide type (YY vs CC: OR=1.428, 95%CI=1.017-2.006, Pheterogeneity=0.220). In addition, in the stratified analysis by cancer type, an increased risk was identified in hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer in C282Y polymorphism, as well as pancreatic cancer in H63D polymorphism, whereas a decreased risk of colorectal cancer was identified in C282Y polymorphism. Present study suggested that H63D and C282Y polymorphisms associated with an increased risk of overall cancer. Nevertheless, well- designed study with large sample size will be continued on this issue of interest.	26107216
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Betaine supplementation is less effective than methionine restriction in correcting phenotypes of CBS deficient mice.	Journal of inherited metabolic disease	2016	3.54	Cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) deficiency is a recessive inborn error of metabolism characterized by elevated serum total homocysteine (tHcy). Betaine supplementation, which can lower tHcy by stimulating homocysteine remethylation to methionine, is often given to CBS deficient patients in combination with other treatments such as methionine restriction and supplemental B-vitamins. However, the effectiveness of betaine supplementation by itself in the treatment of CBS deficiency has not been well explored. Here, we have examined the effect of a betaine supplemented diet on the Tg-I278T Cbs (-/-) mouse model of CBS deficiency and compared its effectiveness to our previously published data using a methionine restricted diet. Tg-I278T Cbs (-/-) mice on betaine, from the time of weaning until for 240 days of age, had a 40 % decrease in mean tHcy level and a 137 % increase in serum methionine levels. Betaine-treated Tg-I278T Cbs (-/-) mice also exhibited increased levels of betaine-dependent homocysteine methyl transferase (BHMT), increased levels of the lipogenic enzyme stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD-1), and increased lipid droplet accumulation in the liver. Betaine supplementation largely reversed the hair loss phenotype in Tg-I278T Cbs (-/-) animals, but was far less effective than methionine restriction in reversing the weight-loss, fat-loss, and osteoporosis phenotypes. Surprisingly, betaine supplementation had several negative effects in control Tg-I278T Cbs (+/-) mice including decreased weight gain, lean mass, and bone mineral density. Our findings indicate that while betaine supplementation does have some beneficial effects, it is not as effective as methionine restriction for reversing the phenotypes associated with severe CBS deficiency in mice.	26231230
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	The effect of dietary modulation of sulfur amino acids on cystathionine β synthase-deficient mice.	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	2016	4.52	Cystathionine β synthase (CBS) is a key enzyme in the methionine and cysteine metabolic pathway, acting as a metabolic gatekeeper to regulate the flow of fixed sulfur from methionine to cysteine. Mutations in the CBS gene cause clinical CBS deficiency, a disease characterized by elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) and methionine and decreased plasma cysteine. The treatment goal for CBS-deficient patients is to normalize the metabolic values of these three metabolites using a combination of vitamin therapy and dietary manipulation. To better understand the effectiveness of nutritional treatment strategies, we have performed a series of long-term dietary manipulation studies using our previously developed Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mouse model of CBS deficiency and sibling Tg-I278T Cbs(+/-) controls. Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice have undetectable levels of CBS activity, extremely elevated plasma tHcy, modestly elevated plasma methionine, and low plasma cysteine. They exhibit several easily assayable phenotypes, including osteoporosis, loss of fat mass, reduced life span, and facial alopecia. The diets used in these studies differed in the amounts of sulfur amino acids or sulfur amino acid precursors. In this review, we will discuss our findings and their relevance to CBS deficiency and the concept of gene-diet interaction.	26599618
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Pathogenesis, Diagnosis and Treatment of Hemochromatosis.	Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)		0.5	Hemochromatosis is a common cause of chronic liver disease and HFE genotyping allows decisive and non-invasive diagnosis. Molecular and clinical genetic studies have led to the identification of genes other than HFE in patients with inherited diseases associated with increased hepatic iron storage that can cause hemochromatosis, which adds complexity to a diagnostic approach to patients with suspected hemochromatosis. Despite major advances in genetics, hepatic iron quantification by non-invasive methods therefore remains the key to the diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Although associated with homozygosity for the C282Y polymorphism in the HFE gene in >80% of patients, hemochromatosis is a complex genetic disease with strong environmental disease modifiers. Testing for mutations in the non-HFE hemochromatosis genes transferrin receptor 2, hemojuvelin, HAMP and SLC40A1 is complex, costly and time-consuming. Demonstration of hepatic iron overload by liver biopsy or MRI is therefore required before such complex tests are carried out. The pathogenesis of chronic liver disease in hemochromatosis is mainly attributed to the redox potential of tissue iron, and only the more recent studies have focused on the toxic properties of circulating iron. Considering the fact that an increased saturation of transferrin and high iron in plasma are the hallmark of all hemochromatosis forms, an alternative view would be that toxic iron in the circulation is involved in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis. Recent studies have shown an increased concentration of redox-active iron in plasma in patients with increased transferrin saturation. This finding supports the hypothesis that tissue iron may be the 'smoking gun' of iron-induced organ damage. Taken together, caring for patients with suspected or established hemochromatosis still remains a challenge, where understanding the genetics, biochemistry and cell biology of hemochromatosis will aid better diagnosis and treatment of affected individuals.	27170390
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Undiagnosed diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in HFE C282Y homozygotes and HFE wild-type controls in the HEIRS Study.	BMJ open diabetes research & care	2016	0.5	To determine prevalences and predictors of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus (UDM) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in non-Hispanic whites with HFE p.C282Y homozygosity and controls without common HFE mutations identified in population screening. We analyzed these observations in a postscreening examination: age; sex; body mass index; systolic/diastolic blood pressure; metacarpophalangeal joint hypertrophy; hepatomegaly; blood neutrophils; alanine and aspartate aminotransferase; elevated C reactive protein; transferrin saturation; serum ferritin; and Field Center. There were 223 p.C282Y homozygotes and 449 controls without diagnosed diabetes (43.9% men). Mean age of p.C282Y homozygotes was 52±13 years (controls 57±14 years; p<0.0001). Mean transferrin saturation in p.C282Y homozygotes was 67±26% (controls 34±14%; p<0.0001). Mean serum ferritin in p.C282Y homozygotes was 607 pmol/L (95% CI 497 to 517; controls 274 pmol/L (247 to 301); p<0.0001). Overall prevalences of UDM (4.0% vs 4.2%) and IFG (23.8% vs 25.6%) did not differ significantly between p.C282Y homozygotes and wt/wt controls, respectively. In logistic regressions, male sex, body mass index, and alanine aminotransferase were significantly associated with UDM. ORs were 2.7 (1.2 to 2.8); 1.0 (1.0 to 1.1); and 1.0 (1.0 to 1.0), respectively. Age, male sex, and body mass index were significantly associated with IFG. ORs were 1.0 (1.0 to 1.1); 2.8 (1.9 to 4.2); and 1.0 (1.0 to 1.1), respectively. Prevalences of UDM and IFG were similar in p.C282Y homozygotes and controls in a postpopulation screening examination. Male sex was the strongest predictor of UDM and IFG.	28074138
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary haemochromatosis in two cousins with cluster headache.	Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache	2002	6.05	A 60-year-old woman with secondary chronic cluster headache had increased serum ferritin and serum transferrin saturation and was homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, which is indicative of hereditary haemochromatosis. Treatment with venesection that normalized her iron stores led to a radical improvement of her headache complaints that had been daily for several years. Later, the headache returned to some degree in spite of normal serum ferritin levels. Her cousin, a 33-year-old man who had had episodic cluster headache for several years, also had increased transferrin saturation and was compound heterozygous for two mutations, a genotype known to be associated with a slightly increased frequency of haemochromatosis. This is the first report of a headache disorder in a patient with hereditary haemochromatosis. The coexistence of the two disorders may be a mere coincidence, but the temporary improvement of headache from depletion of iron stores may indicate a causal relation, possibly mediated by iron deposits in pain-modulating centres in the brainstem.	12100096
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary haemochromatosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in males: a strategy for estimating the potential for primary prevention.	Journal of medical screening	2003	1.75	Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene is the main cause of iron overload in hereditary haemochromatosis. This study calculated the number of hepatocellular carcinoma cases among a cohort of white males that could be attributed to C282Y homozygosity. A better understanding of the extent of potentially preventable mortality arising from this cancer might help with decision making about the feasibility of population screening. We combined information from published life tables, age-specific cancer rates and DNA studies of archived liver biopsy specimens to calculate the number of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma that might occur during the lifetime of a cohort of 1,000,000 men, including a subgroup of 5000 C282Y homozygotes. Hepatocellular carcinoma was estimated to occur in 2673 men in the cohort (1:374); 267 of these cases were in the subgroup of 5000 C282Y homozygotes (1:17). If these 267 cases were prevented, the remaining lifetime risk among all males would be 1:416. The relative risk for this cancer in C282Y homozygotes is 23. There continues to be uncertainty about the efficacy of screening for haemochromatosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most readily quantifiable serious health problem attributable to this source. Further confirmatory DNA (C282Y) studies would be helpful in larger, unbiased sets of archived biopsy specimens, as a way to confirm the present estimate. Any strategy designed to prevent attributable liver cancer is likely to prevent other serious problems from haemochromatasis as well.	12790309
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene C282Y variant is associated with colorectal cancer in Caucasians: a meta-analysis.	Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine	2013	0.5	The HFE gene has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. However, the results have been conflicting. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the association of HFE gene C282Y variant with colorectal cancer. PubMed and Embase were retrieved to identify the potential literature. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) was calculated using fixed- or random-effects model. A total of eight papers including nine studies (7,588 colorectal cancer cases and 81,571 controls) for HFE gene C282Y variant were included in the meta-analysis. The result indicated that HFE gene C282Y variant was significantly associated with colorectal cancer under recessive model (OR = 2.00, 95 % CI = 1.32-3.04), with no evidence of between-study heterogeneity (I (2) = 0.2 %, p = 0.432). Further subgroup analysis by number of cases suggested the effect was significant in studies with more than 500 cases (OR = 2.51, 95 % CI = 1.58-3.98, I (2) = 0.0 %, p = 0.921), but not in studies with less than 500 cases (OR = 0.75, 95 % CI = 0.28-1.97, I (2) = 0.0 %, p = 0.622). The current meta-analysis supported the positive association of HFE gene C282Y variant with colorectal cancer. Further large-scale studies with the consideration for gene-gene/gene-environment interactions should be conducted to investigate the association.	23553028
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	C282Y polymorphism in the HFE gene is associated with risk of breast cancer.	Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine	2013	0.5	The C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in the HFE gene have been implicated in susceptibility of breast cancer, but a number of studies have reported inconclusive results. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in the HFE gene and breast cancer risk by meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and Embase databases, covering all related studies until March 2, 2013. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA 10.0. A total of 7 studies including 1,720 cases and 18,296 controls for HFE C282Y polymorphism and 5 studies including 942 cases and 1,571 controls for HFE H63D polymorphism were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that HFE C282Y polymorphism was significantly associated with increased risk of breast cancer under homozygotes vs. wild-type model (OR = 2.06, 95%CI = 1.19-3.58) and recessive model (OR = 1.98, 95%CI = 1.14-3.44) but not under heterozygotes vs. wild-type model (OR = 0.97, 95%CI = 0.70-1.35), dominant model (OR = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.72-1.40) and multiplicative model (OR = 1.04, 95%CI = 0.76-1.42). However, we did not find any association between HFE H63D polymorphism and breast cancer risk under all genetic models. This current meta-analysis suggested that C282Y polymorphism rather than H63D might be associated with increased risk of breast cancer.	23681799
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Gender and plasma iron biomarkers, but not HFE gene mutations, increase the risk of colorectal cancer and polyps.	Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine	2015	0.5	A cohort study of patients included in the Basque Country colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programme was carried out to assess the risk of adenomatous polyps and CRC (P-CRC) associated with HFE gene mutations, with gender and with iron biomarkers (serum ferritin (SF), iron (Fe) and transferrin saturation index (TSI)). Among 432 included patients (mean age 59.8 years), 263 were men (60.9 %) and 169 women (39.1 %). P-CRC were identified in 221 patients (51.2 %) and no polyps (NP) in 211 patients (48.8 %). HFE mutations were identified in 43.8 % of the patients. C282Y/wt genotypic frequency was 6.8 % in the P-CRC group and 1.4 % in the NP group (p < 0.05). The allelic frequency was 3.8 versus 1.2 % (p < 0.05). For laboratory, all three iron biomarkers showed a statistically significant difference: mean Fe, 91.29 ± 34 for P-CRC and 80.81 ± 30.59 for NP group. Mean TSI for P-CRC was 24.95 ± 8.90 and 22.74 ± 8.79 for NP group. Mean SF 308.09 ± 536.32 for P-CRC and 177.55 ± 159.95 for NP group. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, only male gender (odds ratio (OR) = 2.04, 1.29-3.22), SF (OR = 1.001, 1.0004-1.003) and Fe (OR = 1.01, 1.004-1.02) were related with the presence of CRC and adenoma. Men gender and raised serum iron biomarkers increase the risk of P-CRC.	25854174
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association of HFE gene mutations with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the Iranian population.	Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)	2016	0.5	To determine whether the HFE gene variants H63D and C282Y are associated with NAFLD in persons with type 2 diabetes, we conducted a case-control study including 145 case of NAFLD patients with a history of type 2 diabetes and 145 matching control. The genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral venous blood and the genotyping of HFE gene mutations was analyzed using the PCR-RFLP technique. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 12.0 software by χ2 test, t test and ANOVA (P&lt;0.05). Data showed no increased frequency of HFE mutations in persons with type 2 diabetes and no association between H63D mutation and NAFLD in the study population. Also, we analyzed index of physiological variables including FBS, lipid profile (TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C), BMI, HbA1c, and micro albuminuria and Cr levels). Data showed there are no relationship between these indexes and HFE gene mutations and either NAFLD as a complication of diabetes. But our results showed a relationship between C282Y mutation and NAFLD in persons with type 2 diabetes. C282Y mutation might be a genetic marker of NAFLD in Iranian population.	27894410
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	GNPAT p.D519G is independently associated with markedly increased iron stores in HFE p.C282Y homozygotes.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2016	0.5	GNPAT p.D519G positivity is significantly increased in HFE p.C282Y homozygotes with markedly increased iron stores. We sought to determine associations of p.D519G and iron-related variables with iron stores in p.C282Y homozygotes. We defined markedly increased iron stores as serum ferritin >2247pmol/L (>1000μg/L) and either hepatic iron >236μmol/g dry weight or iron >10g by induction phlebotomy (men and women). We defined normal or mildly elevated iron stores as serum ferritin <674.1pmol/L (<300μg/L) or either age≥40y with iron ≤2.5g iron by induction phlebotomy or age≥50y with ≤3.0g iron by induction phlebotomy (men only). We compared participant subgroups using univariate methods. Using multivariable logistic regression, we evaluated associations of markedly increased iron stores with these variables: age; iron supplement use (dichotomous); whole blood units donated; erythrocyte units received as transfusion; daily alcohol consumption, g; and p.D519G positivity (heterozygosity or homozygosity). The mean age of 56 participants (94.6% men) was 55±10 (SD) y; 41 had markedly increased iron stores. Prevalences of swollen/tender 2nd/3rd metacarpophalangeal joints and elevated aspartate or alanine aminotransferase were significantly greater in participants with markedly increased iron stores. Only participants with markedly increased iron stores had cirrhosis. In multivariable analyses, p.D519G positivity was the only exposure variable significantly associated with markedly increased iron stores (odds ratio 9.9, 95% CI [1.6, 60.3], p=0.0126). GNPAT p.D519G is strongly associated with markedly increased iron stores in p.C282Y homozygotes after correction for age, iron-related variables, and alcohol consumption.	27936396
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Pathophysiological consequences and benefits of HFE mutations - 20 years of research.	Haematologica	2017	6.67	Mutations in the HFE (hemochromatosis) gene cause hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder that is hallmarked by excessive accumulation of iron in parenchymal organs. The HFE mutation p.Cys282Tyr is pathologically most relevant and occurs in the Caucasian population with a carrier frequency of up to 1 in 8 in specific European regions. Despite this high prevalence, the mutation causes a clinically relevant phenotype only in a minority of cases. In this review, we summarize historical facts and recent research findings about hereditary hemochromatosis and outline the pathological consequences of the associated gene defects. In addition, we discuss potential advantages of HFE mutations in asymptomatic carriers.	28280078
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association of HFE gene C282Y and H63D mutations with liver cirrhosis in the Lithuanian population.	Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)	2016	0.5	Liver cirrhosis is the end-stage disease of chronic liver injury. Due to differences in the natural course of chronic liver diseases, identification of genetic factors that influence individual outcomes is warranted. HFE-linked hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) predisposes disease progression to cirrhosis; however, the role of heterozygous C282Y or H63D mutations in the development of cirrhosis in the presence of other etiological factors is still debated. The aim of this study was to determine the association between heterozygous C282Y and H63D mutations and non-HH liver cirrhosis in Lithuanian population. The patient cohort consisted of 209 individuals. Diagnosis of cirrhosis was confirmed by clinical, laboratory parameters, liver biopsy, and radiological imaging. Control samples were obtained from 1005 randomly selected unrelated healthy individuals. HFE gene mutations were determined using the PCR-RFLP method. The most common causes of cirrhosis were hepatitis C (33.9%), hepatitis B (13.6%), and alcohol (25.8%). C282Y allele was associated with the presence of cirrhosis (OR=2.07; P=0.005); this was also observed under recessive model for C282Y (OR=2.06, P=0.008). The prevalence of C282Y allele was higher in cirrhotic men than in controls (7.0% vs. 2.8%, P=0.002). The carriage of H63D risk allele (OR=1.54; P=0.02), heterozygous C282Y/wt and homozygous H63D/H63D genotypes were associated with liver cirrhosis in males (OR=2.48, P=0.008, and OR=4.13, P=0.005, respectively). Heterozygous C282Y mutation of the HFE gene was associated with liver cirrhosis in the Lithuanian population. In gender-related analysis, heterozygous C282Y and homozygous H63D mutations were linked to liver cirrhosis in men, not in women.	27816425
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effect of Hereditary Hemochromatosis Gene H63D and C282Y Mutations on Iron Overload in Sickle Cell Disease Patients.	Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology	2016	0.5	Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease that is one of the most important reasons for iron overload. Sickle cell disease is a hemoglobinopathy that occurs as a result of a homozygous mutation in the hemoglobin gene. Erythrocyte transfusion is frequently used in the treatment of this disease. Iron overload as a result of transfusion is important in the mortality and morbidity of sickle cell anemia patients as well as in other hemoglobinopathies. In this study, the effect of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) p.H63D and p.C282Y mutations on transfusion-related cardiac and liver iron overload in sickle cell disease patients who carry homozygous hemoglobin S mutation has been investigated. This is a prospective single-center cross-sectional study in patients with homozygous hemoglobin S mutation between the years 2008 and 2013. The patients were divided into two groups. The first group (group A, n=31) was receiving chelation therapy and the second group (group B, n=13) was not. Direct and indirect iron loads were analyzed by magnetic resonance imaging and biochemically, respectively. HFE gene mutations were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Statistical analyses were performed by independent samples t-test. p.H63D mutation was detected in 10 (32.3%) patients in group A and in only 1 patient (7.7%) in group B. When the 2 groups were compared for iron overload, iron deposition in the liver was significantly higher in group B (p=0.046). In addition, in group A, iron deposition was significantly higher in HFE mutation carriers compared to patients without the mutation (p=0.05). Results of this study showed that HFE gene mutations are important in iron deposition in the liver in patients with sickle cell disease.	27095682
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron and restless legs syndrome: treatment, genetics and pathophysiology.	Sleep medicine	2016	3.34	In this article, we review the original findings from MRI and autopsy studies that demonstrated brain iron status is insufficient in individuals with restless legs syndrome (RLS). The concept of deficient brain iron status is supported by proteomic studies from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and from the clinical findings where intervention with iron, either dietary or intravenous, can improve RLS symptoms. Therefore, we include a section on peripheral iron status and how peripheral status may influence both the RLS symptoms and treatment strategy. Given the impact of iron in RLS, we have evaluated genetic data to determine if genes are directly involved in iron regulatory pathways. The result was negative. In fact, even the HFE mutation C282Y could not be shown to have a protective effect. Lastly, a consistent finding in conditions of low iron is increased expression of proteins in the hypoxia pathway. Although there is lack of clinical data that RLS patients are hypoxic, there are intriguing observations that environmental hypoxic conditions worsen RLS symptoms; in this chapter we review very compelling data for activation of hypoxic pathways in the brain in RLS patients. In general, the data in RLS point to a pathophysiology that involves decreased acquisition of iron by cells in the brain. Whether the decreased ability is genetically driven, activation of pathways (eg, hypoxia) that are designed to limit cellular uptake is unknown at this time; however, the data strongly support a functional rather than structural defect in RLS, suggesting that an effective treatment is possible.	28057495
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	C282Y/H63D hemochromatosis mutations and microevolution: Speculations concerning the Basque population.	Homo : internationale Zeitschrift fur die vergleichende Forschung am Menschen	2017	0.5	The Basques live at the Western extremity of the Pyrenees. According to linguistic and genetic data they could be considered as one of the most ancient European populations. Numerous studies have evidenced particular patterns in the frequency of several genetic polymorphisms in this relatively unmixed human group. We discuss herein the puzzling distribution of the two major hemochromatosis HFE mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. Thus, one can observe a low frequency of C282Y and, in contrast, one of the highest European frequencies of H63D. Genetic drift (enhanced by the long history and the small size of this population), long persistence of Paleolithic iron-rich diet, lower exposure to major infectious threats and limited mixing with both Celts and Vikings (who demonstrate the highest prevalence of C282Y) could be the underlying factors explaining these particular genetic features. Historical and environmental data represent key elements for understanding the role of the different evolutionary forces which shape the genetic profile of human populations.	28034447
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The Study of HFE Genotypes and Its Expression Effect on Iron Status of Iranian Haemochromatosis, Iron Deficiency Anemia Patients, Iron-Taker and Non Iron-Taker Controls.	Recent advances in DNA & gene sequences	2015	0.5	The role of HFE gene mutations or its expression in regulation of iron metabolism of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) patients is remained controversial. Therefore here the correlation between two common HFE genotype (p.C282Y, p.H63D) and HFE gene expression with iron status in HH, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and healthy Iranian participants was studied. For this purpose genotype determination was done by polymerase chain reaction--restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Real-Time PCR was applied for evaluation of HFE gene expression. Biochemical parameters and iron consumption were also assessed. Homozygote p.H63D mutation was seen in all HH patients and p.C282Y was not observed in any member of the population. A significant correlation was observed between serum ferritin (SF) level and gender or age of HH patients. p.H63D homozygote was seen to be able to significantly increase SF and transferrin saturation (TS) level without affecting on liver function. Our results also showed that iron consumption affects on TS level increasing. HFE gene expression level of IDA patients was significantly higher than other groups. Also the HFE gene expression was negatively correlated with TS. Finally, the main result of our study showed that loss of HFE function in HH is not derived from its gene expression inhibition and much higher HFE gene expression might lead to IDA. However we propose repeating of the study for more approval of our finding.	25687342
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Proton Pump Inhibitors Reduce the Frequency of Phlebotomy in Patients With Hereditary Hemochromatosis.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2016	7.68	Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) need frequent phlebotomies to reduce iron overload. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were reported to reduce the need for phlebotomies in patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE. We investigated the effects of PPI treatment on numbers of phlebotomies in these patients. We conducted a retrospective study of patients with HH homozygous for the C282Y mutation by using the database and medical records from Atrium Medical Centrum Parkstad in Brunssum, The Netherlands. In a paired group analysis of 12 patients, we compared mean serum levels of ferritin and number of phlebotomies needed each year during the periods of 3 years before and 3 years after the start of PPI therapy. We compared these results with those from a group who received PPIs for at least 2 years (n = 9) and a group who never received PPIs (n = 36). We found a significant reduction in median number of phlebotomies after patients began taking PPIs vs. before (0.50 vs. 3.17, P < .002). Patients who received PPIs for at least 2 years needed significantly fewer phlebotomies than patients in the paired group before they started taking PPIs (1.25 vs. 3.17, P < .001). The number of phlebotomies in the group who never received PPIs was significantly higher than in the paired group after they started taking PPIs (3.0 vs. 0.5, P < .001). On the basis of a retrospective analysis, in patients with HH homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE, treatment with PPIs for 2 or more years significantly reduced the number of phlebotomies required to maintain serum levels of ferritin below 100 μg/L.	26240005
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The H63D mutation of the hemochromatosis gene is associated with sustained virological response in chronic hepatitis C patients treated with interferon-based therapy: a meta-analysis.	The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine	2012	0.5	The hemochromatosis (HFE) gene encodes the HFE protein that regulates iron absorption. HFE mutations lead to the hemochromatosis disease of excessive iron absorption. HFE mutations may also influence the sustained virologic response (SVR, long-term virus suppression) in chronic hepatitis C patients treated with interferon-based antiviral therapy. We performed a meta-analysis of all English and Chinese language studies of HFE mutations and SVR in interferon-treated chronic hepatitis C patients indexed in the Medline, PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases to November 2011. Seven studies involving 605 patients with HFE mutations (homozygous or heterozygous mutation of C282Y, H63D or S65C) and 1279 with wild-type HFE (no mutation of C282Y, H63D or S65C for both alleles) were analyzed. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with the fixed- or random-effect models. HFE mutations were associated with significantly higher SVR rate (vs. wild-type: OR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.23-1.97, P < 0.001), indicating that mutation carriers were likely to achieve SVR in response to interferon-based antiviral therapy. Stratification analysis by HFE mutation type revealed that the H63D mutation was associated with a significantly higher SVR rate (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.09-2.34, P = 0.020), while the C282Y mutation was not (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.71-1.98, P = 0.510). Our meta-analysis results indicate that the H63D mutation in HFE is associated with a higher SVR rate in chronic hepatitis C patients treated with interferon-based antiviral therapy.	22499121
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	C282Y and H63D Polymorphisms in Hemochromatosis Gene and Risk of Parkinson's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.	American journal of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias	2016	0.5	A meta-analysis was performed to better clarify the association between hemochromatosis (HFE) gene and the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD). Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated from fixed- and random-effect models. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using the I(2) and Q test. Egger's test was used to estimate the publication bias. We identified 8 articles with 9 independent studies for this meta-analysis. The present meta-analysis showed no significant association of Y allele with the risk of PD in dominant (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.70-1.09), recessive (OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 0.61-4.10), and codominant (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.72-1.09) models for C282Y. There were also no significant associations of D allele with the risk of PD in dominant (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.87-1.24), recessive (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.70-2.18), and codominant (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.89-1.22) genetic models for H63D. No publication bias was detected. The meta-analysis indicated that C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in the HFE gene might not be associated with PD.	26340960
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of single nucleotide variants of HFE gene and association to survival in The Cancer Genome Atlas GBM data.	PloS one	2017	3.06	Human hemochromatosis protein (HFE) is involved in iron metabolism. Two major HFE polymorphisms, H63D and C282Y, have been associated with an increased risk of cancers. Previously, we reported decreased gender effects in overall survival based on H63D or C282Y HFE polymorphisms patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). However, the effect of other single nucleotide variation (SNV) in the HFE gene on the cancer development and progression has not been systematically studied. To expand our finding in a larger sample, and to identify other HFE SNV, we analyzed the frequency of somatic SNV in HFE gene and its relationship to survival in GBM patients using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) GBM (Caucasian only) database. We found 9 SNVs with increased frequency in blood normal of TCGA GBM patients compared to the 1000Genome. Among 9 SNVs, 7 SNVs were located in the intron and 2 SNVs (i.e., H63D, C282Y) in the exon of HFE gene. The statistical analysis demonstrated that blood normal samples of TCGA GBM have more H63D (p = 0.0002, 95% Confidence interval (CI): 0.2119-0.3223) or C282Y (p = 0.0129, 95% CI: 0.0474-0.1159) HFE polymorphisms than 1000Genome. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the 264 GBM samples revealed no difference between wild type (WT) HFE and H63D, and WT HFE and C282Y GBM patients. In addition, there was no difference in the survival of male/female GBM patients based on HFE genotype. There was no correlation between HFE expression and survival. In conclusion, the current results suggest that somatic HFE polymorphisms do not impact GBM patients' survival in the TCGA data set of GBM.	28358914
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH).	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2016	4.58	Molecular genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is recognized as a reference test to confirm the diagnosis of suspected HH or to predict its risk. The vast majority (typically >90%) of patients with clinically characterized HH are homozygous for the p.C282Y variant in the HFE gene, referred to as HFE-related HH. Since 1996, HFE genotyping was implemented in diagnostic algorithms for suspected HH, allowing its early diagnosis and prevention. However, the penetrance of disease in p.C282Y homozygotes is incomplete. Hence, homozygosity for p.C282Y is not sufficient to diagnose HH. Neither is p.C282Y homozygosity required for diagnosis as other rare forms of HH exist, generally referred to as non-HFE-related HH. These pose significant challenges when defining criteria for referral, testing protocols, interpretation of test results and reporting practices. We present best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of HH where recommendations are classified, as far as possible, according to the level and strength of evidence. For clarification, the guidelines' recommendations are preceded by a detailed description of the methodology and results obtained with a series of actions taken in order to achieve a wide expert consensus, namely: (i) a survey on the current practices followed by laboratories offering molecular diagnosis of HH; (ii) a systematic literature search focused on some identified controversial topics; (iii) an expert Best Practice Workshop convened to achieve consensus on the practical recommendations included in the guidelines.	26153218
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in asymptomatic hereditary hemochromatosis subjects with C282Y homozygosity.	The American journal of cardiology	2012	0.5	"""It is not well known whether systemic iron overload per se in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is associated with cardiac arrhythmias before other signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease occur. In the present study, we examined the incidence of cardiac arrhythmia in cardiac asymptomatic subjects with HH (New York Heart Association functional class I) and compared it to that in age- and gender-matched normal volunteers. The 42 subjects with HH and the 19 normal control subjects were recruited through the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored """"Heart Study of Hemochromatosis."""" They completed 48-hour Holter electrocardiography ambulatory monitoring at the baseline evaluation. The subjects with HH were classified as newly diagnosed (group A) and chronically treated (group B) subjects. All subjects with HH had C282Y homozygosity, and the normal volunteers lacked any HFE gene mutations known to cause HH. Although statistically insignificant, the incidence of ventricular and supraventricular ectopy tended to be greater in the combined HH groups than in the controls. Supraventricular ectopy was more frequently noted in group B compared to in the controls (ectopy rate per hour 11.1 ± 29.9 vs 1.5 ± 3.5, p < 0.05, using the Kruskal-Wallis test). No examples of heart block, other than first-degree atrioventricular node block, were seen in any of the subjects. The incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was not significantly reduced after 6 months of intensive iron removal therapy in the group A subjects. No life-threatening arrhythmias were observed in our subjects with HH. In conclusion, our data suggest that the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias is, at most, marginally increased in asymptomatic subjects with HH. A larger clinical study is warranted to further clarify our observation."""	22196777
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Activation of mutant enzyme function in vivo by proteasome inhibitors and treatments that induce Hsp70.	PLoS genetics	2010	6.66	Missense mutant proteins, such as those produced in individuals with genetic diseases, are often misfolded and subject to processing by intracellular quality control systems. Previously, we have shown using a yeast system that enzymatic function could be restored to I278T cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), a cause of homocystinuria, by treatments that affect the intracellular chaperone environment. Here, we extend these studies and show that it is possible to restore significant levels of enzyme activity to 17 of 18 (94%) disease causing missense mutations in human cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by exposure to ethanol, proteasome inhibitors, or deletion of the Hsp26 small heat shock protein. All three of these treatments induce Hsp70, which is necessary but not sufficient for rescue. In addition to CBS, these same treatments can rescue disease-causing mutations in human p53 and the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase gene. These findings do not appear restricted to S. cerevisiae, as proteasome inhibitors can restore significant CBS enzymatic activity to CBS alleles expressed in fibroblasts derived from homocystinuric patients and in a mouse model for homocystinuria that expresses human I278T CBS. These findings suggest that proteasome inhibitors and other Hsp70 inducing agents may be useful in the treatment of a variety of genetic diseases caused by missense mutations.	20066033
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations and chemotherapy-related cardiovascular risk profile in testicular cancer survivors (TCS).	Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology	2006	20.98	14589 Background: TCS show an increased incidence of treatment-related cardiovascular disease. Standard chemotherapy (CT) may cause tissue damage by inducing free oxygen radicals through release of redox-active iron from body iron stores. HFE mutations associated with altered body iron load may therefore contribute to an increase in CT-induced free oxygen radicals and tissue damage. We investigated whether two HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) are associated with cardiovascular risk profile in TCS. From a group of 90 TCS with a known cardiovascular status (JCO 2005; 23: 3718-25), genomic DNA for genotyping was available for 63 TCS (median (range) age at follow-up 35 y (24-54) and median follow-up duration 7 y (3-13)). Two HFE genotype groups were composed: HFE mutation (mut) (n = 19; any mutation C282Y and/or H63D) and HFE wild type (wt) (n = 44). Both groups were compared for cardiovascular risk profile, using Mann-Whitney U Test or Fisher's Exact Test. Groups had received comparable CT regimens. Body iron stores as reflected by plasma ferritin and transferrin saturation were not different for the HFE mut vs HFE wt group, respectively 104 μg/l (21-413) vs. 90 μg/l (22-569); p = 0.53 and 31% (20-49) vs. 30% (11-59); p = 0.15. Signs of vascular damage estimated by urinary albumin excretion and Von Willebrand factor levels were not significantly different: respectively 8.3 mg/24 h (4-165) vs. 7.7 mg/24 h (3-647); p = 0.90 and 90% (52-296) vs. 102% (28-235); p = 0.25. The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors obesity (BMI > 27.8 kg/m 2 ), metabolic syndrome (NCEP ATP III-criteria) and hypertension (mean 24-h blood pressure >135/85 mmHg) are shown in the table. TCS with a mutation in the HFE gene do not show more signs of cardiovascular damage after CT compared to TCS with wt HFE. However, the data suggest that TCS with a HFE mutation may have more frequently cardiovascular risk factors. Further study in a larger group of TCS is needed to explore this observation.

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Penetrance of Hemochromatosis in HFE Genotypes Resulting in p.Cys282Tyr and p.[Cys282Tyr];[His63Asp] in the eMERGE Network.	American journal of human genetics	2015	10.79	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal-recessive disorder associated with pathogenic HFE variants, most commonly those resulting in p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp. Recommendations on returning incidental findings of HFE variants in individuals undergoing genome-scale sequencing should be informed by penetrance estimates of HH in unselected samples. We used the eMERGE Network, a multicenter cohort with genotype data linked to electronic medical records, to estimate the diagnostic rate and clinical penetrance of HH in 98 individuals homozygous for the variant coding for HFE p.Cys282Tyr and 397 compound heterozygotes with variants resulting in p.[His63Asp];[Cys282Tyr]. The diagnostic rate of HH in males was 24.4% for p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes and 3.5% for compound heterozygotes (p < 0.001); in females, it was 14.0% for p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes and 2.3% for compound heterozygotes (p < 0.001). Only males showed differences across genotypes in transferrin saturation levels (100% of homozygotes versus 37.5% of compound heterozygotes with transferrin saturation > 50%; p = 0.003), serum ferritin levels (77.8% versus 33.3% with serum ferritin > 300 ng/ml; p = 0.006), and diabetes (44.7% versus 28.0%; p = 0.03). No differences were found in the prevalence of heart disease, arthritis, or liver disease, except for the rate of liver biopsy (10.9% versus 1.8% [p = 0.013] in males; 9.1% versus 2% [p = 0.035] in females). Given the higher rate of HH diagnosis than in prior studies, the high penetrance of iron overload, and the frequency of at-risk genotypes, in addition to other suggested actionable adult-onset genetic conditions, opportunistic screening should be considered for p.[Cys282Tyr];[Cys282Tyr] individuals with existing genomic data.	26365338
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hereditary hemochromatosis: molecular diagnosis and effect of treatment].	Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej	2004	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, characterized by iron overload. A single mutation (C282Y) in the HFE gene is found in more than 90% of these patients. We report the case of a 50-year-old man, with clinical symptoms of hemochromatosis, who was found to be homozygous for the C282Y mutation. We present the results of therapeutic phlebotomy after one year of the treatment. Genetic tests were performed on the patient's close relatives and revealed that his son was also homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Early phlebotomy could prevent iron deposition and organ damage in this patient. Genetic determining of the HFE mutations is a useful noninvasive method of diagnosing hereditary hemochromatosis.	15508811
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations in patients with alcoholic liver disease. A prospective study from northwestern Poland.	Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej	2010	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis has been linked with C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene encoding human hemochromatosis protein. It is genetic disorder of iron metabolism, leading to iron accumulation and increased liver fibrosis. The association between alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and HFE gene mutations remains unclear and requires clarification. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of C282Y and H63D mutations in patients with ALD and healthy individuals and to analyze laboratory data in the context of HFE gene mutation in ALD patients. We analyzed 119 patients with ALD. The control group comprised 1516 DNA samples obtained either from cord blood or healthy subjects from the records of general practitioners. HFE mutations were detected using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Among the ALD patients, 0.84% were homozygous and 3.36% were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, while 5.04% were homozygous and 21.85% heterozygous for the H63D mutation. There was 1 C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote in the ALD group. In the control group, 2 homozygotes and 117 heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation were identified. As for the H63D mutation, 2.5% homozygotes, 25% heterozygotes, and 1.4% compound heterozygotes were found. There was a trend towards a more common occurrence of ALD patients homozygous for the H63D mutation. Patients with H63D genotype had higher total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The prevalence of HFE mutations in ALD patients is similar to that observed in healthy subjects and comparable to the prevalence in other Central European countries. Our findings on lipid disturbances in the H63D heterozygotes are potentially interesting and require further studies on larger patient groups.	20424537
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Proprotein convertase 7 rs236918 associated with liver fibrosis in Italian patients with HFE-related hemochromatosis.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2016	3.32	p.Cys282Tyr homozygosity is the prevalent genotype in (HFE)-related Hereditary Hemochromatosis with low penetrance and variable expression. However, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma remain the main causes of mortality in these patients. Detection of genetic modifiers identifying patients at risk for liver damage would be relevant for their clinical management. We evaluated proprotein convertase 7 (PCSK7) rs236918 as genetic marker of risk of liver fibrosis in an Italian cohort of p.Cys282Tyr homozygotes. Liver fibrosis was histologically assessed by Ishak score. We evaluated PCSK7 alleles and genotypes frequencies according to single or grouped staging scores: absent/mild fibrosis (stage: 0-2), moderate (stage: 3-4), and severe fibrosis/cirrhosis (stage: 5-6). Single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism or Taqman 5'-nuclease assays. The rs236918 allele C frequency increased from stages 0-2 to 5-6 (7.1% vs 13.6%, vs 21.9%, P = 0.003). The wild-type genotype was significantly more frequent in the absent/mild fibrosis group (54.2%) compared with only 17% in patients with severe fibrosis/cirrhosis. At univariate proportional odds model, patients with GC + CC genotypes were 2.77 times (P = 0.0018) more likely to have worse liver staging scores than wild-type patients. In the adjusted analysis, odds ratio was 2.37 (P = 0.0218), and 2.56 (P = 0.0233) when the analysis was restricted to males. An exploratory mediation analysis suggested a direct effect of genotype on severe fibrosis/cirrhosis (odds ratio = 3.11, P = 0.0157), and a mild non-significant indirect effect mediated through iron accounting for 28%. These findings confirm that PCSK7 rs236918 C allele is a risk factor for cirrhosis development in Italian patients with HFE-Hemochromatosis.	26868056
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Porphyria cutanea tarda associated with HFE C282Y homozygosity, iron overload, and use of a contraceptive vaginal ring.	Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives	2016	0.5	Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is characterized by decreased uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity in hepatocytes, uroporphyrin I and heptacarboxyl porphyrin III accumulation, photosensitivity dermatitis, and increased storage iron. In women, estrogen therapy, including oral contraceptives, postmenopausal hormone replacement, and tamoxifen for breast cancer treatment, is a risk factor for PCT. We report the case of a woman who presented with PCT, HFE C282Y homozygosity, and hepatic iron overload and was using a contraceptive vaginal ring containing ethinyl estradiol, an estrogen. We discuss this case in the context of characteristics of other persons with PCT, including common HFE mutations, iron overload, and estrogen exposure.	26908385
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Worse Outcomes of Patients With HFE Hemochromatosis With Persistent Increases in Transferrin Saturation During Maintenance Therapy.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2017	7.68	Even if patients with hemochromatosis maintain low serum levels of ferritin, they still have an increased risk of general and joint symptoms, which reduce quality of life. This could be related to persistently increased transferrin saturation. We assessed whether duration of exposure to increased transferrin saturation during maintenance therapy is associated with more severe general and joint symptoms. We performed a longitudinal cohort study of 266 individuals homozygous for the C282Y substitution in HFE, seen at a tertiary reference center in Rennes, France, and followed for 3 or more years after initial iron removal. Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were measured at the same time points; values were used to calculate duration of exposure to serum ferritin 50 μg/L or more (FRT50exp) and to determine transferrin saturation 50% or greater (SAT50exp). Clinical and biochemical follow-up data were recorded from log books completed during maintenance therapy. The primary outcome was change in general and joint symptoms, determined from answers to a self-administered questionnaire. Patients were followed for 13.5 ± 5.9 years. FRT50exp (3.2 ± 3.5 years) and SAT50exp (4.5 ± 3.4 years) values correlated (r = 0.38; P < .0001), but each associated with different variables in multivariate analysis. We found independent associations, regardless of follow-up time, between SAT50exp ≥6 years and worsened joint symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 4.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.88-9.31), and between SAT50exp ≥6 years and decreased athletic ability (OR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.16-4.73). SAT50exp ≥8 years associated independently with decreased work ability (OR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.40-7.30) and decreased libido (OR, 3.49; 95% CI, 1.56-7.80). In a longitudinal study of patients treated for hemochromatosis, we associated duration of exposure to increased transferrin saturation (longer than 6 years) with more severe general and joint symptoms. Maintenance of serum levels of ferritin at 50 μg/L or less does not indicate control of transferrin saturation, so guidelines on the management of hemochromatosis require revision.	28111337
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum ferritin concentration predicts hepatic fibrosis better than hepatic iron concentration in human HFE-Haemochromatosis.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2017	4.47	Ferritin is purported to have proinflammatory and profibrogenic effects on hepatic stellate cells. Thus, rather than acting as a passive indicator of hepatic iron concentration (HIC) in haemochromatosis, ferritin may directly influence fibrosis. This study evaluated whether serum ferritin is a better predictor of hepatic fibrosis compared to variables previously associated with increased fibrosis risk in haemochromatosis. We identified 291 C282Y HFE-homozygous patients who had undergone liver biopsy for histological fibrosis staging and measurement of HIC. Ordinal logistic regression determined the best model for fibrosis stage not including serum ferritin. Then, serum ferritin was introduced into this model to assess whether the predictive power of the model was significantly increased and to evaluate the effect on other predictors of fibrosis. Ordinal logistic regression analyses without serum ferritin demonstrated that log HIC (OR 2.89; P < .001), male gender (OR 2.93; P = .005), alcohol consumption (g/day) (OR 1.01; P = .004), steatosis (OR 2.86; P = .01), arthritis (OR 2.46; P = .01) predicted increasing fibrosis stage (n=217). Addition of serum ferritin in multivariate analysis substantially improved the predictive power of the model (χ 2  = 37.15; P < .01) and was highly predictive of fibrosis stage (OR 5.44; P < .001). Inclusion of serum ferritin in this model rendered the effects of HIC, gender, alcohol and steatosis to non-significance. In haemochromatosis, serum ferritin is a better predictor of fibrosis stage than HIC, gender, steatosis and alcohol. These data support a hypothesis that ferritin may play a role in fibrosis rather than simply acting as a passive indicator of iron storage.	28231420
NRXN1	c.2242C>A	p.Leu748Ile	Mutation analysis of the NRXN1 gene in autism spectrum disorders.	Balkan journal of medical genetics : BJMG	2016	0.4	The aim of this study was to identify the sequence mutations in the Neurexin 1 ( NRXN1 ) gene that has been considered as one of the strong candidate genes. A total of 30 children and adolescents (aged 3-18) with non syndromic autism were enrolled this study. Sequencing of the coding exons and the exon-intron boundaries of the NRXN1 gene was performed. Two known mutations were described in two different cases. Heterozygous S14L was determined in one patient and heterozygous L748I was determined in another patient. The S14L and L748I mutations have been described in the patients with autism before. Both of these mutations were inherited from their father. In this study, two of 30 (6.7%) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients carrying NRXN1 gene mutations were detected. It indicates that variants in the NRXN1 gene might confer a risk of developing nonsyndromic ASD. However, due to the reduced penetrance in the gene, the causal role of the NRXN1 gene mutations must be evaluated carefully in all cases.	28289584
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Molecular epidemiology of HFE gene polymorphic variants (C282Y, H63D and S65C) in the population of Espírito Santo, Brazil.	Genetics and molecular research : GMR	2016	0.76	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to progressive iron accumulation and may cause cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes, and heart failure. Most cases of HH have been linked to mutations in genes associated with iron homeostasis. There have been three major variants in the high Fe (HFE) gene associated with the disease: C282Y, H63D and S65C. In this context, we aimed to evaluate the prevalence of the polymorphic variants (C282Y, H63D and S65C) of the HFE gene in the population of the Espírito Santo State (ES), Brazil by analyzing three different groups: general population (N = 120), Pomeranian descendants (N = 59), and patients with HH (N = 20). Using genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood, polymorphic variant identification was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Statistically significant differences were observed for genotype distribution of C282Y (P < 0.001) and H63D (P = 0.013) between the general population and the patients diagnosed with HH. This is the first study to analyze HFE gene allele frequencies for the general population, Pomeranian subpopulation, and patients with HH of ES, Brazil.	27173269
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Molecular and biochemical investigations of patients with intermediate or severe hyperhomocysteinemia.	Molecular genetics and metabolism	2016	3.09	A discrepancy has been identified between numbers of expected and identified patients with homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency. Patients homozygous for the frequent c.833T>C (p.I278T) are most often responsive to vitamin B6, and can present with a total-homocysteine (tHcy) <100 μM on a normal diet. In Denmark, patients with tHcy <100 μM are not routinely sequenced for CBS(2) mutations. This study investigated the prevalence of CBS mutations and the common methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) c.677C>T polymorphism in patients with tHcy ≥ 50 μM and the association with clinical manifestations. We studied a cohort of patients with intermediate and severe hyperhomocysteinemia (tHcy ≥ 50 μM) determined between 1996 and 2011. Among the 413 eligible patients, 184 (45%) patients agreed to participate in the present follow-up study. A MTHFR(3)c.677TT genotype was found in 49% of the patients. Eight patients were found to have mutations in CBS(2). Of those, two were homozygous for c.833T>C (p.I278T), and four were compound heterozygous for c.833T>C. One c.833T>C (p.I278T) compound heterozygote was identified by lowering the threshold for sequencing from tHcy at 100 μM to 50 μM. The most prominent clinical presentation among patients with a CBS(2) mutation was thrombosis presenting at a median age of 25 years. In case of arterial or venous thrombosis without any explanation in individuals below 40 years, tHcy should be part of the thrombophilia screening. When tHcy is between 50 and 100 μM genotyping for the MTHFR(3) c.677TT is relevant, and when tHcy >100 μM CBS should be genotyped.	26750749
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Risk Factors for Insulin Resistance, Metabolic Syndrome, and Diabetes in 248 HFE C282Y Homozygotes Identified by Population Screening in the HEIRS Study.	Metabolic syndrome and related disorders	2016	2.12	We sought to identify risk factors for insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and diabetes mellitus in 248 non-Hispanic white HFE C282Y homozygotes identified by population screening. We analyzed observations obtained prospectively in a postscreening examination: age; sex; body mass index (BMI); systolic/diastolic blood pressure; metacarpophalangeal (MP) joint hypertrophy; hepatomegaly; complete blood counts; alanine/aspartate aminotransferase levels; elevated C-reactive protein (>0.5 mg/dL); transferrin saturation; serum ferritin; homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR); and MetS. Twenty-six participants (10.5%) had diabetes diagnoses. A significant trend across HOMA-IR quartiles was observed only for blood neutrophils. Logistic regression on HOMA-IR fourth quartile revealed positive associations: age (P = 0.0002); male sex (P = 0.0022); and BMI (P < 0.0001). HOMA-IR fourth quartile predicted MetS (P < 0.0001). Logistic regression on diabetes revealed positive associations: age (P = 0.0012); male sex (P = 0.0068); MP joint hypertrophy (P = 0.0167); neutrophils (P = 0.0342); and MetS (P = 0.0298). Serum ferritin did not predict HOMA-IR fourth quartile, MetS, or diabetes. In screening C282Y homozygotes, age, male sex, and BMI predicted HOMA-IR fourth quartile. HOMA-IR fourth quartile alone predicted MetS. Diabetes was associated with greater age, male sex, MP joint hypertrophy, greater blood neutrophil counts, and MetS.	26771691
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Diabetes in HFE Hemochromatosis.	Journal of diabetes research	2017	2.43	Diabetes in whites of European descent with hemochromatosis was first attributed to pancreatic siderosis. Later observations revealed that the pathogenesis of diabetes in HFE hemochromatosis is multifactorial and its clinical manifestations are heterogeneous. Increased type 2 diabetes risk in HFE hemochromatosis is associated with one or more factors, including abnormal iron homeostasis and iron overload, decreased insulin secretion, cirrhosis, diabetes in first-degree relatives, increased body mass index, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. In p.C282Y homozygotes, serum ferritin, usually elevated at hemochromatosis diagnosis, largely reflects body iron stores but not diabetes risk. In persons with diabetes type 2 without hemochromatosis diagnoses, serum ferritin levels are higher than those of persons without diabetes, but most values are within the reference range. Phlebotomy therapy to achieve iron depletion does not improve diabetes control in all persons with HFE hemochromatosis. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes diagnosed today in whites of European descent with and without HFE hemochromatosis is similar. Routine iron phenotyping or HFE genotyping of patients with type 2 diabetes is not recommended. Herein, we review diabetes in HFE hemochromatosis and the role of iron in diabetes pathogenesis in whites of European descent with and without HFE hemochromatosis.	28331855
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene mutations may affect the survival of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.	Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	2016	0.5	The recent availability of potent oral iron chelators is renewing an interest in the assessment of the possible impact of HFE genetics in MDS. Thirty six newly diagnosed patients with MDS were studied for parameters of iron metabolism in addition to C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. Mutations were present in 11 out of 36 patients (31%), which were not different from our general population and were equally distributed among MDS subtypes. Mutated patients had higher ferritin levels (P = 0.039) and lower TIBC (P = 0.018). Ferritin was found to be higher for the untransfused mutated patients (P = 0.017), but not for transfusion-dependent patients in whom ferritin levels correlated significantly with the number of blood units received (P = 0.04). There was no difference in the number of blood units received between the mutated and wild type patients. A new observation made was that the mutated patients had a lower overall survival in addition to a poorer leukemia free survival (LFS) (P = 0.004 and P = 0.003, respectively). The HFE gene mutations are not more frequent in MDS patients. Iron overload in mutated patients was higher but there was no correlation found using supportive therapy for anemia. The effect of mutations on survival could be mediated by changes in iron metabolism. The HFE genotype may predict MDS prognosis and there is a need for further studies. It remains a challenging question if HFE mutated MDS patients should be considered for potent iron chelation therapy.	27077775
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE Gene Mutations and Iron Status in 100 Healthy Polish Children.	Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology	2017	0.5	Iron participates in oxygen transport, energetic, metabolic, and immunologic processes. There are 2 main causes of iron overload: hereditary hemochromatosis which is a primary cause, is a metabolic disorder caused by mutations of genes that control iron metabolism and secondary hemochromatosis caused by multitransfusions, chronic hemolysis, and intake of iron rich food. The most common type of hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by HFE gene mutation. In this study, we analyzed iron metabolism in 100 healthy Polish children in relation to their HFE gene status. The wild-type HFE gene was predominant being observed in 60 children (60%). Twenty-five children (25%), presented with heterozygotic H63D mutation, and 15 children (15%), presented with other mutations (heterozygotic C282Y and S65C mutation, compound heterozygotes C282Y/S65C, C282Y/H63D, H63D homozygote). The mean concentration of iron, the level of ferritin, and transferrin saturation were statistically higher in the group of HFE variants compared with the wild-type group. H63D carriers presented with higher mean concentration of iron, ferritin levels, and transferrin saturation compared with the wild-type group. Male HFE carriers presented with higher iron concentration, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels than females. This preliminary investigation demonstrates allelic impact on potential disease progression from childhood.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Homocysteine concentration in coronary artery disease: Influence of three common single nucleotide polymorphisms.	Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD	2017	3.39	Whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of homocysteine metabolism enzymes influence the rate of cardiovascular (CV) events in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients remains controversial. In this analysis, 1126 subjects from the AtheroGene study with CAD and 332 control subjects without known CAD were included. The following SNPs were investigated: methylentetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR-C667T), methionin synthetase (MS-D919G), and cystathionin beta synthetase (CBS-I278T). The endpoint was the combination of cardiovascular death, stroke, and non-fatal myocardial infarction (N = 286). The median follow-up time was 6.4 years. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed an increasing event rate with rising homocysteine levels (p < 0.001) in CAD patients. Further, in Cox-Regression analysis homocysteine was a predictor of the endpoint with a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.5 (95% CI: 2.9-14.6, p < 0.001) in the adjusted model including cardiovascular risk factors. Of the three SNPs, homozygous MTHFR SNP increased homocysteine levels significantly in patients with CAD and individuals without CAD (both p < 0.001). The SNPs in MS and CBS were not related to relevant changes in homocysteine levels in CAD patients or controls. The different SNPs of MTHFR, MS, and CBS were not related to an increased event rate. Homocysteine level is a strong predictor of CV events. Subjects with and without CAD and SNPs in the enzyme MTHFR had increased homocysteine levels. This was not observed for MS and CBS SNPs. Although MTHFR SNPs alter homocysteine levels in patients and controls, these polymorphisms had no impact on prognosis in CAD patients.	27773468
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Signatures of Evolutionary Adaptation in Quantitative Trait Loci Influencing Trace Element Homeostasis in Liver.	Molecular biology and evolution	2016	13.65	Essential trace elements possess vital functions at molecular, cellular, and physiological levels in health and disease, and they are tightly regulated in the human body. In order to assess variability and potential adaptive evolution of trace element homeostasis, we quantified 18 trace elements in 150 liver samples, together with the expression levels of 90 genes and abundances of 40 proteins involved in their homeostasis. Additionally, we genotyped 169 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in the same sample set. We detected significant associations for 8 protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL), 10 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and 15 micronutrient quantitative trait loci (nutriQTL). Six of these exceeded the false discovery rate cutoff and were related to essential trace elements: 1) one pQTL for GPX2 (rs10133290); 2) two previously described eQTLs for HFE (rs12346) and SELO (rs4838862) expression; and 3) three nutriQTLs: The pathogenic C282Y mutation at HFE affecting iron (rs1800562), and two SNPs within several clustered metallothionein genes determining selenium concentration (rs1811322 and rs904773). Within the complete set of significant QTLs (which involved 30 SNPs and 20 gene regions), we identified 12 SNPs with extreme patterns of population differentiation (FST values in the top 5% percentile in at least one HapMap population pair) and significant evidence for selective sweeps involving QTLs at GPX1, SELENBP1, GPX3, SLC30A9, and SLC39A8. Overall, this detailed study of various molecular phenotypes illustrates the role of regulatory variants in explaining differences in trace element homeostasis among populations and in the human adaptive response to environmental pressures related to micronutrients.	26582562
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	USING IRON STUDIES TO PREDICT HFE MUTATIONS IN NEW ZEALAND: IMPLICATIONS FOR LABORATORY TESTING.	Internal medicine journal	2016	1.53	The diagnosis of Hereditary Haemochromatosis (HH) is not straightforward since symptoms are often absent or non-specific. Biochemical markers of iron-overloading, may be affected by other conditions. This study measured the correlation between iron studies and HFE genotype to inform evidence-based recommendations for laboratory testing in NZ. Results from 2388 patients genotyped for C282Y, H63D and S65C in Wellington NZ from 2007- 2013 were compared to their biochemical phenotype as quantified by SF, transferrin saturation (TS), serum iron (SI) and serum transferrin (ST). The predictive power of these markers was evaluated by Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and if a statistically significant association for a variable was seen, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated. Test ordering patterns showed that 62% of HFE genotyping tests were ordered because of an elevated SF alone and only 11% of these had a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) test to rule out an acute phase reaction. The association between SF and significant HFE genotypes SF was low. However, TS values ≥45% predicted HH mutations with the highest sensitivity and specificity. A SF of >1000 µg/L was found in one at-risk patient (C282Y homozygote) who had a TS < 45%. Our analysis highlights the need for clear guidelines for investigation of hyperferritinaemia and HH in NZ. Using our findings we developed an evidence-based laboratory testing algorithm based on a TS ≥ 45%, a SF ≥ 1000 µg/L and/or a family history of HH which identified all C282Y homozygotes in this study.	28019068
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Impact of HFE mutations on cardiac status in survivors of childhood high-risk ALL: Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Childhood ALL 05-159.	Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology	2011	20.98	9508 Background: Doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapy has been associated with progressive cardiac dysfunction. Laboratory studies suggest DOX-induced cardiac damage may be due to the formation of DOX-iron complexes, leading to free radical formation. Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), a genetic disorder that causes increased iron levels, may be at greater risk for developing DOX-associated cardiotoxicity. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Consortium collected peripheral blood from 185 long-term survivors of high-risk ALL to assess the 2 most frequent allelic variants of the HFE gene associated with HH: C282Y and H63D. Genomic DNA was sequenced using a clinically validated kit from Biotage Inc (PyroMark HFE Cat#40-0053) run on a Pyrosequencer instrument (PSQ HS 96, Biotage Inc) and by taqman and sequenom SNP assay. Echocardiography assessed left ventricular (LV) structure and function. Serum cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) assayed during therapy reflect myocardial injury and cardiomyopathy, respectively. Z scores were derived by comparison to a normal healthy population. 21% (39/185) of patients were heterozygous for H63D; 2 were homozygous. 9% (17/185) of patients were heterozygous for C282Y; 1 was homozygous. HFE mutations were not significantly associated with elevations in cTnT or NT-proBNP. At 2 years post randomization, mean LV fractional shortening, LV mass, and LV end diastolic posterior wall thickness z scores were significantly worse than normal for children who were heterozygous (-0.62, SD 1.35, p=0.03; -0.71, SD 0.85, p<0.001; -0.65, SD 1.53, p=0.04, respectively), but not for those who were wild type, except for LV mass (-0.50, SD 1.2, p=0.003). Homozygotes were not included in the analysis due to small numbers. The frequency of HFE mutations in these patients is similar to the general population. HFE heterozygotes showed significantly lower LV function, mass and wall thickness compared to a normal population. These results support the need for future research on the role of these mutations in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.	28019835
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Should HFE p.C282Y homozygotes with moderately elevated serum ferritin be treated? A randomised controlled trial comparing iron reduction with sham treatment (Mi-iron).	BMJ open	2015	2.56	HFE p.C282Y homozygosity is the most common cause of hereditary haemochromatosis. There is currently insufficient evidence to assess whether non-specific symptoms or hepatic injury in homozygotes with moderately elevated iron defined as a serum ferritin (SF) of 300-1000 µg/L are related to iron overload. As such the evidence for intervention in this group is lacking. We present here methods for a study that aims to evaluate whether non-specific symptoms and hepatic fibrosis markers improve with short-term normalisation of SF in p.C282Y homozygotes with moderate elevation of SF. Mi-iron is a prospective, multicentre, randomised patient-blinded trial conducted in three centres in Victoria and Queensland, Australia. Participants who are HFE p.C282Y homozygotes with SF levels between 300 and 1000 μg/L are recruited and randomised to either the treatment group or to the sham treatment group. Those in the treatment group have normalisation of SF by 3-weekly erythrocytapheresis while those in the sham treatment group have 3-weekly plasmapheresis and thus do not have normalisation of SF. Patients are blinded to all procedures. All outcome measures are administered prior to and following the course of treatment/sham treatment. Patient reported outcome measures are the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS-primary outcome), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short form V.2 (SF36v2) and Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2 short form (AIMS2-SF). Liver injury and hepatic fibrosis are assessed with transient elastography (TE), Fibrometer and Hepascore, while oxidative stress is assessed by measurement of urine and serum F2-isoprostanes. This study has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of Austin Health, Royal Melbourne Hospital and Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Trial identifier: NCT01631708; Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov.	26270952
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE p.C282Y homozygosity predisposes to rapid serum ferritin rise after menopause: A genotype-stratified cohort study of hemochromatosis in Australian women.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2017	3.32	"""Women who are homozygous for the p.C282Y mutation in the HFE gene are at much lower risk of iron overload-related disease than p.C282Y homozygous men, presumably because of the iron-depleting effects of menstruation and pregnancy. We used data from a population cohort study to model the impact of menstruation cessation at menopause on serum ferritin (SF) levels in female p.C282Y homozygotes, with p.C282Y/p.H63D simple or compound heterozygotes and those with neither p.C282Y nor p.H63D mutations (HFE wild types) as comparison groups. A sample of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study was selected for the """"HealthIron"""" study (n = 1438) including all HFE p.C282Y homozygotes plus a random sample stratified by HFE-genotype (p.C282Y and p.H63D). The relationship between the natural logarithm of SF and time since menopause was examined using linear mixed models incorporating spline smoothing. For p.C282Y homozygotes, SF increased by a factor of 3.6 (95% CI (1.8, 7.0), P < 0.001) during the first 10 years postmenopause, after which SF continued to increase but at less than half the previous rate. In contrast, SF profiles for other HFE genotype groups increase more gradually and did not show a distinction between premenopausal and postmenopausal SF levels. Only p.C282Y homozygotes had predicted SF exceeding 200 μg/L postmenopause, but the projected SF did not increase the risk of iron overload-related disease. These data provide the first documented evidence that physiological blood loss is a major factor in determining the marked gender difference in expression of p.C282Y homozygosity."""	27784128
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Identification of New BMP6 Pro-Peptide Mutations in Patients with Iron Overload.	American journal of hematology	2017	5.0	Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder caused by mutations in at least 5 different genes (HFE, HJV, TFR2, SLC40A1, HAMP) involved in the production or activity of the liver hormone hepcidin, a key regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. Nevertheless, patients with an HH-like phenotype that remains completely/partially unexplained despite extensive sequencing of known genes are not infrequently seen at referral centers, suggesting a role of still unknown genetic factors. A compelling candidate is Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6 (BMP6), which acts as a major activator of the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway, ultimately leading to the upregulation of hepcidin gene transcription. A recent seminal study by French authors has described three heterozygous missense mutations in BMP6 associated with mild to moderate late-onset iron overload (IO). Using an updated next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genetic test in IO patients negative for the classical HFE p.Cys282Tyr mutation, we found three BMP6 heterozygous missense mutations in 4 patients from 3 different families. One mutation (p.Leu96Pro) has already been described and proven to be functional. The other two (p.Glu112Gln, p.Arg257His) were novel, and both were located in the pro-peptide domain known to be crucial for appropriate BMP6 processing and secretion. In silico modeling also showed results consistent with their pathogenetic role. The patients' clinical phenotypes were similar to that of other patients with BMP6-related IO recently described. Our results independently add further evidence to the role of BMP6 mutations as likely contributing factors to late-onset moderate IO unrelated to mutations in the established 5 HH genes.

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between the HFE C282Y, H63D Polymorphisms and the Risks of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Liver Cirrhosis and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 5,758 Cases and 14,741 Controls.	PloS one		3.06	Conflicting results have been obtained for the association between two common polymorphisms (C282Y, H63D) of human HFE (hereditary hemochromatosis) gene and the risks of the liver diseases, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An updated systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the potential role of HFE polymorphisms in the susceptibility to NAFLD, liver cirrhosis and HCC. After retrieving articles from online databases, eligible studies were enrolled according to the selection criteria. Stata/SE 12.0 software was utilized to perform the statistical analysis. In total, 43 articles with 5,758 cases and 14,741 controls were selected. Compared with the control group, a significantly increased risk of NAFLD was observed for the C282Y polymorphism in the Caucasian population under all genetic models and for the H63D polymorphism under the allele, heterozygote and dominant models (all OR>1, Passociation<0.05). However, no significant difference between liver cirrhosis cases and the control group was observed for HFE C282Y and H63D (all Passociation>0.05). In addition, we found that HFE C282Y was statistically associated with increased HCC susceptibility in the overall population, while H63D increased the odds of developing non-cirrhotic HCC in the African population (all OR>1, Passociation<0.05). Moreover, a positive association between compound heterozygosity for C282Y/H63D and the risk of NAFLD and HCC, but not liver cirrhosis, was observed. Our meta-analysis provides evidence that the HFE C282Y and H63D polymorphisms confer increased genetic susceptibility to NAFLD and HCC but not liver cirrhosis. Additional well-powered studies are required to confirm our conclusion.	27657935
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	High prevalence of HFE gene mutations in hemodialysis patients.	Minerva urologica e nefrologica = The Italian journal of urology and nephrology	2008	0.5	Hemochromatosis (HH) was a common inherited disease characterized by iron overload. This disease is usually the result of mutations in the HLA-linked hemochromatosis gene (HFE). The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of HFE mutations in a group of Venetian hemodialysis patients. Sixty-one hemodialysis patients, 62 patients with laboratory findings suggestive for iron overload, 57 repeat blood donors were enrolled in the study. HFE mutations were detected by using a commercial strip assay. In this study only H63D and C282Y mutations were observed. The overall prevalence of HFE mutations was 40.9% among hemodialysis patients, 30.6% among patients with laboratory findings of iron overload and 15.8% among blood donors. A high prevalence of HFE mutation among hemodialysis patients was observed. Prevalence of HFE mutation in this group was 40.9%, significantly higher than results observed among blood donors (15.8%, P<0.005) or among patients with laboratory signs of iron overload (30.6%, P<0.01). These data are, at present inexplicable, and this results need further confirmation.	18500222
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Iron overload and insulin resistance].	Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)	2005	0.5	There is increasing evidence that moderately elevated body iron stores, below levels commonly found in genetic hemochromatosis, may be associated with adverse health outcomes. Genetic hemochromatosis, characterized by transferrin saturation (TS) greater than 45%, is most often linked to homozygosity of the HFE C282Y allele. The phenotype is also modulated by mutations of more recently discovered genes (including ferroportin, hemojuvelin, hepcidin, and transferrin receptor) and environmental factors (including alcohol, viruses, diet, blood loss). Iron overload without hemochromatosis is characterized by high levels of serum ferritin and normal TS, as seen in dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis. Elevated serum ferritin levels predict incident type 2 diabetes in prospective studies and have been associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, glucose tolerance disturbances, central adiposity, and metabolic syndrome. High ferritin levels are not synonymous with iron overload and may in some cases be a simple marker of insulin resistance.	16292193
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Pathophysiology and genetics of classic HFE (type 1) hemochromatosis].	Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)	2007	0.5	Hereditary type 1 HFE hemochromatosis is associated with homozygosity for the p.Cys282Tyr mutation of the HFE gene (C282Y mutation). The p.Cys282Tyr mutation of the HFE gene leads to an abnormal reduction in hepatic expression of hepcidin, a protein that appears to control the release of iron from enterocytes and macrophages towards plasma. Abnormally low hepcidin levels promote an increase in the bioavailability of plasma iron, characterized by elevated transferrin saturation and the appearance of non transferrin bound iron. This nontransferrin-bound iron is avidly taken up by the liver, heart, and pancreas, the principal target organs for systemic iron overload. The variable penetrance of this disease is related to environmental and genetic factors. Among the genetic factors, mutations of some newly identified genes may aggravate the phenotype of iron overload associated with homozygosity for the p.Cys282Tyr mutation of the HFE gene; these new genes include those of hemojuvelin (HJV), transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), and hepcidin (HAMP).	17521857
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Screening for hereditary HFE hemochromatosis].	Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)	2007	0.5	Screening for hereditary HFE hemochromatosis in the general population, by either phenotype or genotype, is not currently recommended by the French High Health Authority. Targeted screening for hereditary HFE hemochromatosis in groups with specific diseases (people with asthenia, arthropathic disorders, liver or heart disease, etc.) has not been shown to be effective. Family screening in first-degree relatives of any proband homozygous for C282Y is strongly advised. This should involve both phenotypic screening, that is, testing for serum iron markers and, if possible, a genotype study of siblings and adult children, conducted according to the rules for genetic counseling and testing. This type of screening is cost-effective. One obstacle today is that the national health insurance fund does not reimburse the HFE test.	17544612
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Management of hemochromatosis linked to HFE gene].	Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)	2007	0.5	Phenotypic expression of the homozygous C282Y/C282Y mutation of the HFE gene has been classified in five stages, and appropriate management recommended for each stage. Phlebotomy is indicated for stages>or=2, that is, with elevated transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels >300 microg/L in men and >200 microg/L in women. Maximal volume per phlebotomy is 7 mL/kg and should not exceed 550 mL. The main goal of this iron-depletion therapy is to reach and maintain serum ferritin levels<or=50 microg/L. Phlebotomies performed at home by nurses should be encouraged, under strict conditions. Because genetic counseling and family screening should follow individual diagnosis, the physician must recommend that the patient inform siblings, adult children, and parents. Screening should include simultaneous genetic testing and serum iron markers.	17553656
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Does oxidative stress modulate left ventricular diastolic function in asymptomatic subjects with hereditary hemochromatosis?	Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)	2009	0.5	Little is known about the early mechanisms mediating left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). However, the increased oxidative stress related to iron overload may be involved in this process, and strain rate (SR), a sensitive echocardiography-derived measure of diastolic function, may detect such changes. we evaluated the relationship between left ventricular diastolic function measured with tissue Doppler SR and oxidative stress in asymptomatic HH subjects and control normal subjects. Ninety-four consecutive visits of 43 HH subjects, age 30-74 (50 +/- 10, mean +/- SD), and 37 consecutive visits of 21 normal volunteers, age 30-63 (48 +/- 8), were evaluated over a 3-year period. SR was obtained from the basal septum in apical four-chamber views. All patients had confirmed C282Y homozygosity, a documented history of iron overload, and were New York Heart Association functional class I. Normal volunteers lacked HFE gene mutations causing HH. In the HH subjects, the SR demonstrated moderate but significant correlations with biomarkers of oxidative stress; however, no correlations were noted in normal subjects. The biomarkers of iron overload per se did not show significant correlations with the SR. Although our study was limited by the relatively small subject number, these results suggest that a possible role of oxidative stress to affect LV diastolic function in asymptomatic HH subjects and SR imaging may be a sensitive measure to detect that effect.	19725855
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	A revisit to the natural history of homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency.	Molecular genetics and metabolism	2010	3.09	We review the evidence that in Denmark and probably certain other European countries the number of individuals identified with homocystinuria due to homozygosity for the widespread c.833T>C (p.I278T) mutation in the gene that encodes cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) falls far short of the number of such individuals expected on the basis of the heterozygote frequency for this mutation found by molecular screening. We conclude that the predominant portion of such homozygotes may be clinically unaffected, or may be ascertained for thromboembolic events occurring no sooner than the third decade of life. If so, there was significant ascertainment bias in the time-to-event curves previously published describing the natural history of untreated CBS deficiency Mudd et al. and these curves should be used with care.	19819175
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Using iron studies to predict HFE mutations in New Zealand: implications for laboratory testing.	Internal medicine journal	2017	1.53	The diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is not straightforward because symptoms are often absent or non-specific. Biochemical markers of iron-overloading may be affected by other conditions. To measure the correlation between iron studies and HFE genotype to inform evidence-based recommendations for laboratory testing in New Zealand. Results from 2388 patients genotyped for C282Y, H63D and S65C in Wellington, New Zealand from 2007 to 2013 were compared with their biochemical phenotype as quantified by serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation (TS), serum iron (SI) and serum transferrin (ST). The predictive power of these markers was evaluated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and if a statistically significant association for a variable was seen, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated. Test ordering patterns showed that 62% of HFE genotyping tests were ordered because of an elevated SF alone and only 11% of these had a C-reactive protein test to rule out an acute phase reaction. The association between SF and significant HFE genotypes SF was low. However, TS values ≥45% predicted HH mutations with the highest sensitivity and specificity. A SF of >1000 µg/L was found in one at-risk patient (C282Y homozygote) who had a TS <45%. Our analysis highlights the need for clear guidelines for investigation of hyperferritinaemia and HH in New Zealand. Using our findings, we developed an evidence-based laboratory testing algorithm based on a TS ≥45%, a SF ≥1000 µg/L and/or a family history of HH which identified all C282Y homozygotes in this study.	28019068
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis, characteristics in 51 patients].	Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)	2003	0.5	Dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis is a recently described entity, which reunites iron overloads associated with polymetabolic syndromes, steatosis and steato-hepatitis. The aim of this study was to specify the relationship between iron overload, polymetabolic syndrome, HFE mutations of primary hemochromatosis and steatosis. This was a 5-year retrospective study of 51 patients hospitalised and/or seen in consultation, non-alcoholic, presenting with hyperferritinemia associated with a polymetabolic syndrome and/or hepatic steatosis. Patients mean age was of 53 +/- 12 years with a sex ratio M/F of 5.4. Metabolic disorders were found in 97% of the non-steatosis patients (overweight: 40%, perturbed sugar metabolism: 47%, dyslipidemia: 79.5%). Hyperferritinemia was constant but moderate (513.4 +/- 280.3 ng/ml). Transferrin saturation was predominantly normal (0.44 +/- 0.17). The hepatic enzymes were normal or only slightly perturbed. Steatosis was revealed by sonography in 62% of cases. The hepatic iron overload, documented in 6 patients by hepatic needle biopsy, was discreet (concentration/age ratio of 1.64 +/- 0.19). Among the 59% patients screened for the HFE gene, 40% were positive for C282Y and/or H63D. There was no correlation between ferritin levels and iron parameters, polymetabolic syndrome parameters and hepatic enzymes. The HFE mutations had no influence on the iron parameters. Dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis must be know by hospital practitioners because of their prevalence in cases of hyperferritinemia and their therapeutic incidence.	12712916
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotyping demonstrates a significant incidence of hemochromatosis in undifferentiated arthritis.	Clinical and experimental rheumatology		2.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism. Among Northern Europeans the carrier frequency is estimated to be 1 in 10, while up to 1 in 200 is affected by the disease. Arthropathy is one early clinical manifestation of this disease, but the articular features are often misdiagnosed. In this study the two frequent mutations of the HLA-linked hemochromatosis gene (HFE) were investigated in a rheumatology clinic population. Two hundred and six consecutive patients (mean age 57.7 years; 38 male/168 female) attending a rheumatology clinic over a period of 14 months were screened for HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D). All standard diagnostic procedures were used to identify the aetiology of the arthropathy. Mutations were evaluated by separation on PAGE of digested PCR amplificates of DNA (by SnapI and Bcl-I, for C282Y and H63D, respectively) obtained from PBMCs. The C282Y and H63D allele frequencies were 4.5 and 12.8 in patients with rheumatic diseases. Five patients were homozygote for H63D (2.4%), and one for C282Y (0.5%). Five patients were compound heterozygous (2.4%). The observed C282Y allele frequency in rheumatic patients with undifferentiated arthritis was 12.9 and exceeded that of healthy subjects (p = 0.01). Determination of the HFE genotype is clinically useful in patients with arthritis of unknown origin, to allow early diagnosis of hemochromatosis.	15789881
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effects of highly conserved major histocompatibility complex (MHC) extended haplotypes on iron and low CD8+ T lymphocyte phenotypes in HFE C282Y homozygous hemochromatosis patients from three geographically distant areas.	PloS one	2013	3.06	Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is a recessively inherited disorder of iron overload occurring commonly in subjects homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE gene localized on chromosome 6p21.3 in linkage disequilibrium with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A locus. Although its genetic homogeneity, the phenotypic expression is variable suggesting the presence of modifying factors. One such genetic factor, a SNP microhaplotype named A-A-T, was recently found to be associated with a more severe phenotype and also with low CD8(+)T-lymphocyte numbers. The present study aimed to test whether the predictive value of the A-A-T microhaplotype remained in other population settings. In this study of 304 HH patients from 3 geographically distant populations (Porto, Portugal 65; Alabama, USA 57; Nord-Trøndelag, Norway 182), the extended haplotypes involving A-A-T were studied in 608 chromosomes and the CD8(+) T-lymphocyte numbers were determined in all subjects. Patients from Porto had a more severe phenotype than those from other settings. Patients with A-A-T seemed on average to have greater iron stores (p = 0.021), but significant differences were not confirmed in the 3 separate populations. Low CD8(+) T-lymphocytes were associated with HLA-A*03-A-A-T in Porto and Alabama patients but not in the greater series from Nord-Trøndelag. Although A-A-T may signal a more severe iron phenotype, this study was unable to prove such an association in all population settings, precluding its use as a universal predictive marker of iron overload in HH. Interestingly, the association between A-A-T and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes, which was confirmed in Porto and Alabama patients, was not observed in Nord-Trøndelag patients, showing that common HLA haplotypes like A*01-B*08 or A*03-B*07 segregating with HFE/C282Y in the three populations may carry different messages. These findings further strengthen the relevance of HH as a good disease model to search for novel candidate loci associated with the genetic transmission of CD8(+) T-lymphocyte numbers.	24282517
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis, HFE C282Y homozygosity, and bariatric surgery: report of three cases.	Obesity surgery		3.35	Iron absorption is decreased in some individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery. We evaluated measures of iron metabolism and therapeutic phlebotomy in 3 adults with hemochromatosis and HFE C282Y homozygosity who underwent bariatric surgery. 1 male and 1 female had surgery before diagnosis of hemochromatosis (jejuno-ileal bypass and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, respectively); neither had iron overload. Another man was treated with serial phlebotomy to induce iron depletion; later, he underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. His maintenance phlebotomy requirement for hemochromatosis decreased substantially (on average approximately 1 unit each 71 days before surgery, and approximately 1 unit each 173 days after surgery). None of these patients developed iron deficiency, and none took supplemental iron. Iron absorption is decreased in some patients with hemochromatosis and HFE C282Y homozygosity after bariatric surgery, but their risk of developing iron deficiency may be diminished.	15603661
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HLA haplotype A*03-B*07 in hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity: frequency disparity in men and women and lack of association with severity of iron overload.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Before the discovery of HFE, reports suggested that hemochromatosis patients with the ancestral haplotype (or some element thereof) have more severe iron overload than those without the haplotype. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses of the relationships of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*03 and HLA haplotype A*03-B*07 to iron measures (serum iron concentration, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin concentration at diagnosis and units of phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion) in hemochromatosis probands homozygous for HFE C282Y diagnosed in medical care. Iron overload was defined by demonstration of hepatic iron index of > or =1.9 or removal of > or =2.0 g Fe by therapeutic phlebotomy. We tabulated the phenotype frequencies of HLA-A*03 and the frequencies of common HLA haplotypes A*01-B*08, A*02-B*44, A*03-B*07, and A*03-B*14 in three groups of white adults: (1) 141 hemochromatosis probands with C282Y homozygosity; (2) 195 index cases with IgG subclass deficiency (IgGSD) or common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), disorders typically linked to Ch6p, and (3) 750 control subjects. Among probands, 86 men and 42 women had iron overload. Frequencies of HLA-A and -B alleles in probands did not depart significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The phenotype frequency of A*03 did not differ significantly between men and women in the each of the respective three groups. The frequency of haplotype A*03-B*07 was greater in men than women with hemochromatosis (0.3081 vs. 0.1455; P = 0.0019). The frequency of A*03-B*014 was significantly greater in women than men with hemochromatosis (0.1182 vs. 0.0407, respectively; P = 0.0134). Mean values of most iron measures were not affected by numbers of copies of A*03 or by presence of A*03-B*07 in either men or women in univariate analysis. ANOVA models of sex, age at diagnosis, and all HLA alleles and haplotypes in probands were used to determine effects of these variables on iron measures. ANOVA models revealed that (1) there were no significant predictors for serum iron concentration; (2) B*14 is associated with higher transferrin saturation in women and lower transferrin saturation in men; (3) A*01-B*08 is associated with a trend of higher serum ferritin levels; and (4) A*03-B*14 is associated with exaggeration of the age-associated upward trend in units of phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion. In hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity, we conclude that (1) disparate frequencies of HLA haplotypes A*03-B*07 and A*03-B*14 occur in men and women and (2) HLA-A*03 and HLA-A*03-B*07 are not independent variables associated with iron overload severity.	15607698
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Allele frequencies of hemojuvelin gene (HJV) I222N and G320V missense mutations in white and African American subjects from the general Alabama population.	BMC medical genetics	2004	2.09	Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for coding region mutations of the hemojuvelin gene (HJV) in whites is a cause of early age-of-onset iron overload (juvenile hemochromatosis), and of hemochromatosis phenotypes in some young or middle-aged adults. HJV coding region mutations have also been identified recently in African American primary iron overload and control subjects. Primary iron overload unexplained by typical hemochromatosis-associated HFE genotypes is common in white and black adults in Alabama, and HJV I222N and G320V were detected in a white Alabama juvenile hemochromatosis index patient. Thus, we estimated the frequency of the HJV missense mutations I222N and G320V in adult whites and African Americans from Alabama general population convenience samples. We evaluated the genomic DNA of 241 Alabama white and 124 African American adults who reported no history of hemochromatosis or iron overload to detect HJV missense mutations I222N and G320V using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. Analysis for HJV I222N was performed in 240 whites and 124 African Americans. Analysis for HJV G320V was performed in 241 whites and 118 African Americans. One of 240 white control subjects was heterozygous for HJV I222N; she was also heterozygous for HFE C282Y, but had normal serum iron measures and bone marrow iron stores. HJV I222N was not detected in 124 African American subjects. HJV G320V was not detected in 241 white or 118 African American subjects. HJV I222N and G320V are probably uncommon causes or modifiers of primary iron overload in adult whites and African Americans in Alabama. Double heterozygosity for HJV I222N and HFE C282Y may not promote increased iron absorption.	15610558
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis: Niche Construction and the Genetic Domino Effect in the European Neolithic.	Human biology	2015	0.86	Hereditary hemochromatosis is caused by a potentially lethal recessive gene (HFE, C282Y allele) that increases iron absorption and reaches polymorphic levels in northern European populations. Because persons carrying the allele absorb iron more readily than do noncarriers, it has often been suggested that HFE is an adaptation to anemia. We hypothesize positive selection for HFE began during or after the European Neolithic with the adoption of an iron-deficient high-grain and dairying diet and consequent anemia, a finding confirmed in Neolithic and later European skeletons. HFE frequency compared with rate of lactase persistence in Eurasia yields a positive linear correlation coefficient of 0.86. We suggest this is just one of many mutations that became common after the adoption of agriculture.	26416321
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[The H63D mutation in the HFE gene is related to the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma].	Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva	2007	1.46	To disclose whether mutations in the HFE gene inducing liver iron overload are related to the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in otherwise predisposed patients. One hundred and ninety-six patients (161 males) diagnosed with HCC and 181 healthy controls were included in the study. All subjects were white Spaniards.C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene were identified in leucocyte genomic DNA using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and specific restriction enzymes. RESULTS (CASES/CONTROLS): 1. Genotype distribution: a) C282Y mutation: homozygotes 1/0, heterozygotes 12/23, wild type 183/158 (p = 0.07, non significant); b) H63D mutation: homozygotes 9/5, heterozygotes 85/52, wild type 102/124 (0dds ratio 2.00, 95% C.I. 1.29-3.12, p = 0.002. Four cases and 6 controls were carriers of heterozygous mixed genotypes. 2. Allele frequencies: a) C282Y mutation: wild type allele 378/339, mutated allele 14/23 (p = 0.11, non significant); b) H63D mutation: wild type allele 289/300, mutated allele 103/62 (0dds ratio 1.72, 95% C.I. 1.19-2.50, p = 0.004). Age at diagnosis, gender and etiology of the underlying liver disease do not influence these findings. The C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is not related to the risk of HCC in non-hemochromatosis patients. The H63D mutation is associated with a higher risk of HCC in cirrhotic patients irrespective of their underlying liver disease.	17973580
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Biological variability of transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity.	The American journal of medicine	2007	0.5	Transferrin saturation is widely considered the preferred screening test for hemochromatosis. Unsaturated iron-binding capacity has similar performance at lower cost. However, the within-person biological variability of both these tests may limit their ability at commonly used cut points to detect HFE C282Y homozygous patients. The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study screened 101,168 primary care participants for iron overload using transferrin saturation, unsaturated iron-binding capacity, ferritin, and HFE C282Y and H63D genotyping. Transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity were performed at initial screening and again when selected participants and controls returned for a clinical examination several months later. A missed case was defined as a C282Y homozygote who had transferrin saturation below the cut point (45% for women, 50% for men) or unsaturated iron-binding capacity above the cut point (150 micromol/L for women, 125 micromol/L for men) at the initial screening or the clinical examination, or both, regardless of serum ferritin. There were 209 C282Y previously undiagnosed homozygotes with transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity testing performed at the initial screening and clinical examination. Sixty-eight C282Y homozygotes (33%) would have been missed at these transferrin saturation cut points (19 men, 49 women; median serum ferritin level of 170 microg/L; first and third quartiles, 50 and 474 microg/L), and 58 homozygotes (28%) would have been missed at the unsaturated iron-binding capacity cut points (20 men, 38 women; median serum ferritin level of 168 microg/L; first and third quartiles, 38 and 454 microg/L). There was no advantage to using fasting samples. The within-person biological variability of transferrin saturation and unsaturated iron-binding capacity limits their usefulness as an initial screening test for expressing C282Y homozygotes.	17976429
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management.	Critical care nursing clinics of North America	2008	0.28	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease resulting in inappropriate intestinal iron absorption leading to iron overload and end-organ disease. The disease is most prevalent in white individuals of European descent. The C282Y mutation on the HFE gene accounts for most cases of HH; however, other genetic mutations have been identified. End-organ damage results in cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and cardiomyopathy. Therapeutic phlebotomy to deplete excessive iron stores is the standard treatment of HH and results in normal longevity if therapy is initiated before end-organ disease occurs.	18424348
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum ferritin concentrations and body iron stores in a multicenter, multiethnic primary-care population.	American journal of hematology	2008	5.0	How often elevated serum ferritin in primary-care patients reflects increased iron stores (normally 0.8 g in men, 0.4 g in women) is not known. The Hereditary Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) study screened 101,168 primary-care participants (44% Caucasians, 27% African-Americans, 14% Asians/Pacific Islanders, 13% Hispanics, 2% others). Follow-up clinical evaluation was performed in 302 of 333 HFE C282Y homozygotes regardless of iron measures and 1,375 of 1,920 nonhomozygotes with serum ferritin >300 microg/L (men), >200 microg/L (women) and transferrin saturation >50% (men), >45% (women). Quantitative phlebotomy was conducted in 122 of 175 C282Y homozygotes and 122 of 1,102 nonhomozygotes with non-transfusional serum ferritin elevation at evaluation. The estimated prevalence in the Caucasian population of C282Y homozygotes with serum ferritin >900 microg/L at evaluation was 20 per 10,000 men and 4 per 10,000 women; this constellation was predictive of iron stores >4 g in men and >2 g in women. The estimated prevalence per 10,000 of non-C282Y homozygotes with serum ferritin >900 microg/L at evaluation was 7 among Caucasians, 13 among Hispanics, 20 among African Americans, and 38 among Asians and Pacific Islanders, and this constellation was predictive of iron stores >2 g but <4 g. In conclusion, serum ferritin >900 microg/L after initial elevations of both serum ferritin and transferrin saturation is predictive of mildly increased iron stores in multiple ethnic populations regardless of HFE genotype. Serum ferritin >900 microg/L in male C282Y homozygotes is predictive of moderately increased iron stores.	18429050
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iranian hereditary hemochromatosis patients: baseline characteristics, laboratory data and gene mutations.	Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research	2012	1.4	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in white people, characterized by highly abnormal uptake of iron from the gastrointestinal tracts. Recently, mutation studies have focused to detect the genes responsible for HH. In this cross-sectional study, 12 HH patients were recruited, who were referred to Firoozgar Hospital, Tehran, Iran. In addition to the clinical assessments, a complete laboratory evaluation, imaging modalities, histopathologic assessment, atomic absorption spectrophotometry and gene mutation study were performed. The genetic study for HFE gene mutation was examined for all of the patients since 2006, while non-HFE mutation was conducted since December 2010 (only for 1 of them). Twelve patients were evaluated consisting of 11 men and 1 woman, with the mean age of 39.58±12.68 yr. The average of atomic iron loads was 13.25±4.83-fold higher than normal standards. Four patients had heterozygotic mutation of H63D (33.3%). There was no significant difference in either the iron load of liver (P=0.927) and heart (P=0.164) or serum concentration of ferritin (P=0.907) and TIBC (P=0.937) between the HFE-mutant and without HFE mutation HH cases. In contrast to other studies, C282Y mutation was not detected in any of our Iranian HH patients. Heterozygotic mutations of H63D (HFE) and TFR2 (non-HFE) genes were found to be more common in these patients. Similar to previous reports, these mutations were not found to be significantly associated with severity of presentation in HH patients.	23018356
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Spectrum of CBS mutations in 16 homocystinuric patients from the Iberian Peninsula: high prevalence of T191M and absence of I278T or G307S.	Human mutation	2003	5.09	Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency has been extensively studied, but to date, no spectrum of CBS mutations of Spanish homocystinuric patients has been reported. Here we present a mutation analysis of thirteen Spanish and three Portuguese unrelated homocystinuric patients. Ten mutations were found to account for the thirty-two mutant alleles and five of these (C275Y, L338P, S349N, R379Q, and L456P) are reported here for the first time. All five novel mutations were found to affect evolutionarily conserved residues suggesting that they may impair enzyme function. Interestingly, neither of the two common CBS mutations, I278T and G307S, was detected in this series, and no patient was found to respond to pyrodoxine. Enzyme activities in cultured fibroblasts from 10 of the patients were assayed, and they ranged from 0 to 13 % of controls analyzed in parallel. The T191M mutation (which has only ever been reported once before in a Spanish patient) accounted for 50% of the mutant alleles. Comparison of the clinical data of seven patients homozygous for T191M indicated that this genotype is a poor predictor of the phenotype. A common haplotype was identified in all the T191M chromosomes of Spanish origin, while a different one was present in the four T191M chromosomes from Portuguese patients.	12815602
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Linked linear amplification for simultaneous analysis of the two most common hemochromatosis mutations.	Clinical chemistry	2003	7.46	Two mutations in HFE, G845A (amino acid substitution C282Y) and C187G (H63D), are associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. We developed and validated a novel method, linked linear amplification (LLA), for detection of these two mutations. Two segments of HFE were amplified by a multiplex LLA reaction that generated biotinylated LLA products. Aliquots of the multiplex LLA reaction were captured in microwells by hybridization to immobilized allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASOs). One wild-type and one mutant ASO represented the DNA sequence at each of the two mutation sites. Hybridization was detected by a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase-based colorimetric method. Genotypes obtained by LLA and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods for 320 individuals were compared. The amplified samples included the following genotypes as determined by PCR-RFLP: wild-type 282 and 63 codons (n = 105), C282Y homozygous mutant (n = 54), C282Y heterozygous (n = 52), H63D homozygous mutant (n = 17), H63D heterozygous (n = 59), and compound H63D and C282Y heterozygous mutant (n = 33). There was complete concordance between the results obtained by LLA and those obtained by PCR-RFLP analysis. The presence of another HFE mutation, A193T (encoding S65C), did not interfere with genotyping at codon 63. LLA provides a reliable method to detect the common mutations in HFE that cause hereditary hemochromatosis.	12816900
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Strategy for diagnosis and management in iron overload.	Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva	2003	1.46	When suspecting an iron overload condition, the transferrin saturation levels should be determined. Levels higher than 45% and serum ferritin in men and postmenopausal women exceeding 200 microg/l confirm the iron overload. Afterwards, the HFE protein genotype should be determined. If it is C282Y or C282Y/H63D, the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis can be accepted as the cause of the iron overload. In the absence of said genotypes, the overload is secondary or not related to the HFE protein. In hereditary hemochromatosis, the degree of iron overload and organic lesions must be established. Liver biopsies are very useful for obtaining said information and for the first case, the determination of serum ferritin is very useful. When less than 1000 microg/l, normal transaminases and no hepatomegalies, a treatment can be started without the need for a liver biopsy. In absence of anemia, the treatment is based on phlebotomies, 400-500 ml a week until obtaining depletion of excess iron. In presence of anemia, the treatment is based on chelating agents, preferably subcutaneous administered 8 hours a day.	12828522
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haptoglobin type neither influences iron accumulation in normal subjects nor predicts clinical presentation in HFE C282Y haemochromatosis: phenotype and genotype analysis.	British journal of haematology	2003	5.4	In the UK, 90% of patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) are homozygous for HFE C282Y, as are one in 150 people in the general population. However, only a minority of these will develop clinical haemochromatosis. Iron loss modifies iron accumulation but so may other genetic factors. Haptoglobin (Hp) exists as three major types (Hp 1-1, Hp 2-1 or Hp 2-2) and binds free plasma haemoglobin. In men, Hp 2-2 has been shown to be associated with increased macrophage iron accumulation and serum ferritin concentration. Furthermore, the frequency of Hp 2-2 was shown to be increased in patients with HH. We determined Hp types by phenotyping and genotyping 265 blood donor control subjects and 173 subjects who were homozygous for HFE C282Y. The latter group included 66 blood donors lacking clinical features suggestive of haemochromatosis and without a known family history, and 68 patients presenting clinically with haemochromatosis. Hp 2-2 frequencies did not differ in control subjects and C282Y homozygotes. Hp 2-2 was not a risk factor for disease development in HH. To investigate the relationship between iron accumulation and haptoglobin type, we determined transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration in 192 male, first-time blood donors aged 20-40 years who lacked both HFE C282Y and H63D. Transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentrations did not vary with Hp type.	12846904
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis: the new blood donor.	Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program	2013	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) due to homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is a common inherited iron overload disorder in whites of northern European descent. Hepcidin deficiency, the hallmark of the disorder, leads to dysregulated intestinal iron absorption and progressive iron deposition in the liver, heart, skin, endocrine glands, and joints. Survival is normal if organ damage is prevented by early institution of phlebotomy therapy. HH arthropathy is the symptom most affecting quality of life and can be debilitating. Genotype screening in large population studies has shown that the clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygosity is highly variable and can be very low, with up to 50% of women and 20% of men showing a silent phenotype. Targeted population screening for the HFE C282Y mutation is not recommended at present, but might be reconsidered as a cost-effective approach to management if counseling and care were better organized and standardized. Referral of patients to the blood center for phlebotomy therapy and use of HH donor blood for transfusion standardizes treatment, minimizes treatment costs, and may benefit society as a whole. Physician practices should be amended such that HH subjects are more frequently referred to the blood center for therapy.	24319245
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Non-HFE hemochromatosis: pathophysiological and diagnostic aspects.	Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology	2014	1.87	Rare genetic iron overload diseases are an evolving field due to major advances in genetics and molecular biology. Genetic iron overload has long been confined to the classical type 1 hemochromatosis related to the HFE C282Y mutation. Breakthroughs in the understanding of iron metabolism biology and molecular mechanisms led to the discovery of new genes and subsequently, new types of hemochromatosis. To date, four types of hemochromatosis have been identified: HFE-related or type1 hemochromatosis, the most frequent form in Caucasians, and four rare types, named type 2 (A and B) hemochromatosis (juvenile hemochromatosis due to hemojuvelin and hepcidin mutation), type 3 hemochromatosis (related to transferrin receptor 2 mutation), and type 4 (A and B) hemochromatosis (ferroportin disease). The diagnosis relies on the comprehension of the involved physiological defect that can now be explored by biological and imaging tools, which allow non-invasive assessment of iron metabolism. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to support the physicians in the diagnosis and management of those rare diseases.	24321703
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygous HFE haemochromatosis.	The Clinical biochemist. Reviews	2004	0.5	The prevalence of the C282Y homozygous HFE genotype is high, approximately 1 in 200 in populations of Anglo-Celtic descent, and most authorities assumed this mutation would have a high clinical penetrance. Recent studies report the clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygous hereditary haemochromatosis is much lower than its prevalence, with possibly less than 5% developing clinical disease, although there is lack of consensus on a precise estimate. This review discusses reasons for this paradigm shift, including controversy on various definitions of clinical penetrance. It is inescapable that there are pronounced variations in clinical penetrance, and that certain C282Y homozygous individuals will not develop the clinical phenotype. This has prompted a search for modifier gene mutations amongst iron-metabolism genes, especially the known non- HFE haemochromatosis genes, and for possible environmental factors which might explain the observed variation in clinical penetrance.	18458707
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Blood loss is a stronger predictor of iron status in men than C282Y heterozygosity or diet.	Journal of the American College of Nutrition	2008	2.25	To determine the relative importance of HFE gene, diet, lifestyle, and blood loss characteristics for predicting iron status in a sample of men aged 40 years or over. Iron status (serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor) was measured in 44 C282Y heterozygote and 85 age- and BMI-matched wildtype men aged 40 years or over. Dietary intake of iron (total, heme and non-heme), and components known to influence iron bioavailability, was determined using a validated Meal-Based Intake Assessment Tool. Information on lifestyle and blood loss was obtained by questionnaire. Height and weight were measured to determine Quetelet's body mass index. Linear mixed models were used to determine the extent to which these variables predicted iron status. C282Y heterozygosity was associated with 17% higher transferrin saturation (95% CI: 6%, 29%) but no difference in serum ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor concentrations. Blood donation was negatively associated with transferrin saturation (-13% (- 3%, -22%)) and serum ferritin (-58% (-44%, -68%)), and had a marginally significant positive association with soluble transferrin receptor concentration. Self-reported fecal blood loss was negatively associated with serum ferritin concentration (-35% (-54%, -7%)). Alcohol was the only dietary variable associated with iron status and was associated with all three of the iron status indices. Serum ferritin concentration was positively associated with body mass index (10% per unit increase (6%, 15%)). Blood loss was a stronger predictor of iron status than either C282Y heterozygosity or diet in this population of men aged 40 years and over.	18460494
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Stimulation of an unfolded protein response impairs MHC class I expression.	Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)	2007	0.5	HFE C282Y is an example of a mutant protein that does not fold correctly, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and was found previously to diminish surface expression of MHC class I (MHC-I). We now show that its expression in 293T cells triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR), as revealed by the increased levels of H chain binding protein, GRP94, and C/EBP homologous protein. Elevated levels of these proteins were also found in HFE C282Y homozygous PBMCs. Following the UPR induction, a decrease in MHC-I cell surface expression was observed. This defect in MHC-I could be mimicked, however, by overexpression of transcriptionally active isoforms of activating transcription factor-6 and X box-binding protein-1, which induced the UPR, and reversed in HFE C282Y-expressing cells by using dominant-negative constructs that block UPR signaling. The present results provide evidence to the finding that stimulation of an UPR affects MHC-I expression.	17339458
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum measures of iron status and HFE gene mutations in patients with hepatitis B virus infection.	Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology	2007	2.21	We tested associations between HFE mutations and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. We also explored measures of total body iron status and their association with chronic HBV infection. Serum measures of iron status and HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D, and S65C) were assessed in 344 Iranian patients with chronic HBV infection (214 asymptomatic carriers, 130 patients with chronic progressive liver disease [CPLD]) and 302 controls. Frequencies of HFE mutations did not differ between patients with chronic HBV infection and controls (C282Y: P=0.9, H63D: P= 0.8, S65C: P=0.9). By logistic regression, advanced hepatic fibrosis was associated with HFE H63D mutation (OR=13.1, P=0.006; 95% CI=2.0-84.1). Higher levels of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were observed in patients with CPLD than in healthy controls (P=0.0001 and 0.01, respectively, adjusted for age and sex). None of the serum iron measures was related to liver fibrosis stage or necroinflammatory grade. Serum iron measures are associated with chronic progressive hepatitis B. Carriage of HFE mutations is not associated with the presence of chronic HBV infection or values of serum iron measures in this population, although HFE H63D is associated with more advanced hepatic fibrosis.	17362299
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron overload and HFE gene mutations in Czech patients with chronic liver diseases.	Disease markers	2012	2.14	The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of HFE gene mutations in Czech patients with chronic liver diseases and the influence of the mutations on iron status. The presence of HFE gene mutations (C282Y, H63D, and S65C) analyzed by the PCR-RFLP method, presence of cirrhosis, and serum iron indices were compared among 454 patients with different chronic liver diseases (51 with chronic hepatitis B, 122 with chronic hepatitis C, 218 with alcoholic liver disease, and 63 patients with hemochromatosis). Chronic liver diseases patients other than hemochromatics did not have an increased frequency of HFE gene mutations compared to controls. Although 33.3% of patients with hepatitis B, 43% of patients with hepatitis C, and 73.2% of patients with alcoholic liver disease had elevated transferrin saturation or serum ferritin levels, the presence of HFE gene mutations was not significantly associated with iron overload in these patients. Additionally, patients with cirrhosis did not have frequencies of HFE mutations different from those without cirrhosis. This study emphasizes the importance, not only of C282Y, but also of the H63D homozygous genetic constellation in Czech hemochromatosis patients. Our findings show that increased iron indices are common in chronic liver diseases but {it HFE} mutations do not play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, and alcoholic liver disease.	22297603
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of Two Common HFE Gene Mutations (C282Y and H63D) in a Group of Iranian Patients With Cryptogenic Cirrhosis.	Hepatitis monthly	2011	1.93	The human HFE gene (a key component of iron homeostasis in humans) is involved in hereditary hemochromatosis, a common autosomal recessive genetic disorder that is characterized by excessive intestinal iron absorption and progressive iron overload. In this study, we assessed the frequency of two common forms of hemochromatosis HFE gene mutation (C282Y and H63D) in patients suffering from cryptogenic cirrhosis. One hundred and fifty individuals were included in this study, in which 100 were patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis and 50 were from the normal population. All individuals were examined for common HFE gene mutations by amplification of nucleotide 845 C282Y and 187 H63D alleles and product analysis using the polymerase chain reaction method and restriction enzyme digestion. No case of either a homozygous or heterozygous C282Y mutation was found. For the H63D mutation, no homozygosity was detected but heterozygosity was detected in 22% of patients and in 28% of the normal population. Hereditary hemochromatosis is not a major cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis in the Iranian population.	22308152
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE alleles in an Irish cystic fibrosis population.	Genetic testing	2003	0.5	The variable clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) suggest the influence of modifier genes. Genetic and environmental factors that determine whether an individual will develop associated complications are still being determined. It has been proposed that the gene for hemochromatosis, HFE, may be a modifier locus for CF disease phenotype. Recent research has suggested a relationship between mutations to the HFE gene and the development of meconium ileus (MI) and liver disease in CF. This study aims to expand our knowledge of the HFE mutations C282Y and H63D carrier rate in an Irish population of CF allele carriers. PCR restriction enzyme analysis was performed on blood samples from CF patients to identify the C282Y and H63D mutations. HFE status of CF allele carriers and CF patients (Delta F508) homozygotes with and without meconium ileus was determined. The carrier frequency for C282Y was 30.8% for the Delta F508 homozygote MI positive group, as compared to 12.5% for the non-Delta F508 MI positive group but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.27). Interestingly, no Delta F508 homozygote patients were homozygous for the C282Y mutation.	12885340
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE), Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism.	Neuroscience letters	2003	2.11	Iron overload increases oxidative stress and may lead to neurodegenerative disease like Parkinson's disease (PD). We studied the role of mutations in the hemochromatosis gene HFE in PD and other parkinsonism (non-PD PS) in two population-based series. The first series consisted of 137 patients with PD and 47 with non-PD PS, and the second of 60 patients with PD and 25 with non-PD PS. In the first series, PD patients were significantly more often homozygous for the C282Y mutation than controls (P=0.03). Patients with non-PD PS in both series were more often carriers for the C282Y mutation than controls (P=0.009, P=0.006, respectively). Our data are hampered by small numbers, yet suggest that the C282Y mutation increases the risk of PD and non-PD PS. The rarity of this genotype requires a large series of patients to prove our hypothesis.	12902032
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Digenic inheritance of mutations in HAMP and HFE results in different types of haemochromatosis.	Human molecular genetics	2003	5.99	Haemochromatosis (HH) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease caused by inappropriate iron absorption. Most HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. However, penetrance of the C282Y mutation is incomplete, and other genetic factors may well affect the HH phenotype. Ferroportin and TFR2 mutations also cause HH, and two HAMP mutations have recently been reported that causes juvenile haemochromatosis (JH) in the homozygous state. Here, we report evidence for digenic inheritance of HH. We have detected two new HAMP mutations in two different families, in which there is concordance between severity of iron overload and heterozygosity for HAMP mutations when present with the HFE C282Y mutation. In family A, the proband has a JH phenotype and is heterozygous for C282Y and a novel HAMP mutation Met50del IVS2+1(-G). This is a four nucleotide ATGG deletion which causes a frameshift. The proband's unaffected mother is also heterozygous for Met50del IVS2+1(-G), but lacks the C282Y mutation and is heterozygous for the HFE H63D mutation. Met50del IVS2+1(-G) was absent from 642 control chromosomes. In family B, a second novel, less severe HAMP mutation, G71D, was identified. This was detected in the general population at an allele frequency of 0.3%. We propose that the phenotype of C282Y heterozygotes and homozygotes may be modified by heterozygosity for mutations which disrupt the function of hepcidin in iron homeostasis, with the severity of iron overload corresponding to the severity of the HAMP mutation.	12915468
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hereditary hemochromatosis--new developments after discovery of the HFE gene].	Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie	1999	1.36	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism, resulting in an increased iron deposition and multiorgan failure. Recently a candidate gene of HH, termed HFE, has been identified on chromosome 6, coding for a protein homologous to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Two mutations of the hemochromatosis gene leading to an exchange of cysteine to tyrosine at aminoacid 282 and histidine to asparagine at aminoacid 63, are retained responsible for the development of hereditary hemochromatosis. The Cys282Tyr-mutation disrupts a disulfid bond and thus abrogates binding of the mutant HFE-protein to beta 2-microglobulin and its presentation on the cell surface. The His63Asp-mutation seems to play a role in pH-regulated dissociation of the transferrin receptor/transferrin complex in the lysosome. Mutations of the HFE-protein alter the affinity of the transferrin receptor for its ligand transferrin and may thus cause an intracellular accumulation of iron. Knowledge of the responsible gene allows a molecular diagnosis of HH. The new genetic marker can be used for screening and confirmation of HH reducing the need for confirmatory liver biopsies. Compared to standard screening parameters like ferritin and transferrin saturation genetic testing will allow the diagnosis of HH in an early, asymptomatic state before iron accumulation has occurred. As a normal life expectancy of patients with HH can be achieved if iron reduction is initiated early, genetic testing may thus be of great benefit for patients with HH.	10666843
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Incidence of liver disease in people with HFE mutations.	Gut	2000	14.92	Most patients with haemochromatosis have mutations of the HFE gene. However, the risk to people with HFE mutations of developing disease manifestations of haemochromatosis is not known. To determine the risk of developing cirrhosis and liver cancer in individuals with HFE mutations in a population where few people were being treated for haemochromatosis. 215 archive biopsy specimens of liver cancer (n=34) and cirrhosis (n=190) were retrieved from histology archives. Blood samples from 1000 individuals from the normal population were also collected. DNA was extracted from the biopsy specimens and exons 2 and 4 of the HFE gene were amplified using polymerase chain reaction. The products were analysed for the C282Y (845A) and H63D (187G) mutations. Three (8.8%) patients from the liver cancer group were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Five (2.6%) patients from the cirrhosis group were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. One case fell in both the liver cancer and cirrhosis groups. C282Y homozygosity was thus significantly more frequent in both groups than in the normal population. These 215 cases are representative of a population of about 250 000 over 20 years. During this period we estimate that about 260 births or deaths of C282Y homozygous individuals occurred within this population. A diagnosis of liver cancer or cirrhosis is rare in the lifetime of individuals from this population who are homozygous for the C282Y mutation (2.5%; upper 95% confidence interval (CI) = 8%). Similarly liver disease is rare among C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes (1%; upper 95% CI = 3.5%).	10673304
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis in siblings and children of affected patients. A cost-effectiveness analysis.	Annals of internal medicine	2000	16.44	Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis is traditionally done by using serum iron studies. However, mutation analysis of the hemochromatosis-associated HFE gene has recently become available. To compare the cost-effectiveness of no screening with four screening strategies that incorporate HFE gene testing or serum iron studies. Cost-effectiveness analysis. Published literature. Siblings and children of an affected proband. Lifetime from 10 years of age (children) or 45 years of age (siblings). Societal. 1) Serum iron studies. 2) Gene testing of the proband. If the proband is homozygous (C82Y+/+), the spouse undergoes gene testing; if he or she is heterozygous (C82Y+/-), the children undergo gene testing. 3) Gene testing of the proband; if he or she is homozygous, relatives undergo gene testing. 4) Direct gene testing of relatives. Cost per life-year saved and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. In children, HFE gene testing of the proband was the most cost-effective strategy for screening one child (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $508 per life-year saved). HFE gene testing of the proband followed by testing of the spouse was the most cost-effective strategy for screening two or more children (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $3665 per life-year saved). In siblings, all screening strategies were dominant compared with no screening. Strategies using HFE gene testing were less costly than serum iron studies. Despite varying the prevalence of mutations and regardless of the cost of the genetic test in one- and two-way sensitivity analyses, HFE gene testing remained cost-effective. HFE gene testing for the C282Y mutation is a cost-effective method of screening relatives of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis.	10681280
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis genes and other factors contributing to the pathogenesis of porphyria cutanea tarda.	Blood	2000	11.84	Inherited and acquired factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a disorder characterized by a photosensitive dermatosis and hepatic siderosis. This study, comprising 108 patients with PCT, was intended to define the role of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations in the expression of PCT and to determine the contribution of acquired factors including alcohol, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and estrogen. The 2 known HFE mutations, cysteine 282 tyrosine (Cys282Tyr) and histidine 63 asparagine (His63Asp), were detected by polymerase chain reaction, and anti-HCV immunoglobulin G was detected serologically. Liver biopsies were graded for iron content, inflammation, and fibrosis. Estimates of alcohol and estrogen use were based on a questionnaire. Of the PCT patients tested, 19% were homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation; controls were equal to 0.5%. The compound heterozygous genotype was detected in 7% of the PCT patients; controls were less than 1%. The transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and liver iron burden of all PCT patients were higher than those of nonporphyric controls. The highest values were found in PCT patients homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation. Of the patients studied, 59% were HCV positive (compared with 1.8% of the population), and 46% consumed more than 70 g of alcohol daily. Of the female patients, 63% were ingesting estrogens. Hepatic damage was most marked in patients with the Cys282Tyr/Cys282Tyr genotype who had HCV and drank heavily. Homozygosity for the Cys282Tyr mutation and HCV are the greatest risk factors for expression of PCT, and in most patients, more than 1 risk factor was identified. It was common for patients with HCV to consume alcohol. Patients with PCT should be screened for HFE mutations and for HCV. (Blood. 2000;95:1565-1571)	10688809
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Are haemochromatosis mutations related to the severity of liver disease in hepatitis C virus infection?	Acta haematologica	2000	1.05	It has been proposed that iron overload may adversely affect liver disease outcome. The recent identification of 2 mutations in the HFE gene related to hereditary haemochromatosis (Cys282Tyr and His63Asp) provided an opportunity to test whether they are associated with hepatic iron accumulation and the activity and severity of liver disease in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We investigated the prevalence of HFE mutations in 135 male patients with chronic HCV hepatitis, and correlated genotype distribution with different parameters of iron status and the activity and severity of liver disease. Of these 135 patients, 6 (4.4%) carried Cys282Tyr and 32 (23.7%) carried His63Asp, frequencies which were similar to those observed in healthy controls. Serum iron levels and transferrin saturation (but not ferritin levels or liver iron content) were significantly higher in carriers than in non-carriers of HFE mutations. No difference was observed in serum ALT, AST and GGT levels between carriers and non-carriers. Finally, scores for necroinflammatory activity and fibrosis in the liver were significantly higher in HFE carriers than in non-carriers. Patients with chronic HCV infection carrying HFE mutations tend to present more evident body iron accumulation and a higher degree of necroinflammatory activity and fibrosis in the liver. HFE gene mutations might be an additional factor to be considered among those implicated in the determination of a worse prognosis of the liver disease in chronic HCV infection.	10692680
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis and HFE gene.	Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica		0.71	The discovery of the HFE gene has improved classification and diagnosis of iron overload. Most patients with a phenotypic diagnosis of haemochromatosis are homozygote for the C282Y mutation. Among those with other genotypes, only compound heterozygotes, who present the C282Y mutation on one chromosome and the H63D on the other, may present with haemochromatosis, but with a low penetrance and a mild expression. Other patients usually present with another cause of iron overload, such as insulin resistance, alcoholic liver disease or liver cirrhosis. The practical management of haemochromatosis has been greatly modified, since liver biopsy is no more necessary for diagnosis in C282Y homozygotes, and is only needed for exclusion of cirrhosis. Family screening has also greatly benefited from genotyping.	10692770
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis.	Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie	2000	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common inherited disorder of the iron metabolism. Screening studies indicate that it has a prevalence of one in 200 to 400, depending on the population studied, and a carrier rate of about one in seven to one in 10. Feder et al identified the hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) in 1996 and two candidate mutations; the C282Y mutation has been shown to be responsible for the majority of the hereditary hemochromatosis cases worldwide. The gene discovery has led to rapid advances in the field of iron metabolism. Although the basic defect is still not fully understood, much is known about the sequence of events leading to iron overload. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a major candidate for population screening and meets the screening criteria of the World Health Organization, and Wilson and Jungner. It is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases in white populations, and, importantly, early diagnosis and simple effective treatment allow normal life expectancy. The discovery of the HFE gene and the frequency of the single C282Y mutation as a cause of most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis allow the possibility of widespread genetic testing. However, the logistics, and the psychological and social consequence of this, coupled with incomplete expression of the genotype, necessitate further studies before population screening can be justified.	10694284
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased risk of arthropathies and joint replacement surgery in patients with genetic hemochromatosis: a study of 3,531 patients and their 11,794 first-degree relatives.	Arthritis care & research	2013	3.23	Genetic hemochromatosis (GH) is an autosomal recessive disease in individuals of Northern and Western European descent. Heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation is common (6-20%). Arthropathy is one of the few complications of GH suggested not to be associated with iron body stores; synovial iron deposition remains in iron-depleted patients. Previous studies suggest an elevated prevalence of clinical and radiographic signs of arthropathy in patients with GH, and 2 smaller studies suggest a possibly elevated risk of joint replacement surgery, but more mixed results are shown regarding risks with HFE genotype. We therefore assessed the risks of arthropathy and joint replacement surgery in patients with GH and in their first-degree relatives (FDRs). We performed a population-based cohort study of 3,531 patients with GH and of their 11,794 FDRs (assumed to be heterozygous for the C282Y mutation) using nationwide Swedish population-based health and census registers. Hazard ratios (HRs) of arthropathies and joint replacement surgeries among patients and their FDRs (versus the general population) were assessed using Cox regression. Between 1997 and 2005, 406 of 3,531 patients were reported/hospitalized with any noninfectious arthropathies, including osteoarthritis, corresponding to an HR of 2.38 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.14-2.64). Patients were also at increased risk of hip replacement (HR 2.77, 95% CI 2.27-3.38) and knee replacement (HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.58-2.88) surgery. Among the 11,794 FDRs (patients excluded), we found no increased risk of any of the joint morbidities. Patients with GH, but not their FDRs, are at increased risk of arthropathies, including the need for joint replacement surgery.	23139229
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased serum hepcidin levels in subjects with the metabolic syndrome: a population study.	PloS one	2012	3.06	The recent discovery of hepcidin, the key iron regulatory hormone, has changed our view of iron metabolism, which in turn is long known to be linked with insulin resistant states, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). Serum ferritin levels are often elevated in MetS (Dysmetabolic hyperferritinemia--DHF), and are sometimes associated with a true mild-to-moderate hepatic iron overload (dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome--DIOS). However, the pathophysiological link between iron and MetS remains unclear. This study was aimed to investigate, for the first time, the relationship between MetS and hepcidin at population level. We measured serum hepcidin levels by Mass Spectrometry in 1,391 subjects from the Val Borbera population, and evaluated their relationship with classical MetS features. Hepcidin levels increased significantly and linearly with increasing number of MetS features, paralleling the trend of serum ferritin. In multivariate models adjusted for relevant variables including age, C-Reactive Protein, and the HFE C282Y mutation, ferritin was the only significant independent predictor of hepcidin in males, while in females MetS was also independently associated with hepcidin. Overall, these data indicate that the fundamental iron regulatory feedback is preserved in MetS, i.e. that hepcidin tends to progressively increase in response to the increase of iron stores. Due to recently discovered pleiotropic effects of hepcidin, this may worsen insulin resistance and contribute to the cardiovascular complications of MetS.	23144745
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The A736V TMPRSS6 polymorphism influences hepatic iron overload in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.	PloS one	2012	3.06	Hepatic iron accumulation due to altered trafficking is frequent in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and is associated with more severe liver damage and hepatocellular carcinoma. The p.Ala736Val TMPRSS6 variant influences iron metabolism regulating the transcription of the hepatic hormone hepcidin, but its role in the pathogenesis of iron overload disorders is controversial. Aim of this study was to evaluate the whether the TMPRSS6 p.Ala736Val variant influences hepatic iron accumulation in a well-characterized series of Italian patients with histological NAFLD. 216 patients with histological NAFLD. TMPRSS6 and HFE variants were assessed by allele specific PCR, liver histology by the NAFLD activity score and Perls' staining for iron. Homozygosity for the p.736Val allele previously linked to higher hepcidin did not influence transferrin saturation (TS), but was associated with lower hepatic iron stores (p = 0.01), and ferritin levels (median 223 IQR 102-449 vs. 308 IQR 141-618 ng/ml; p = 0.01). Homozygosity for TMPRSS6 p.736Val was nearly associated with lower ballooning (p = 0.05), reflecting hepatocellular damage related to oxidative stress. The influence of TMPRSS6 on hepatic iron accumulation was more marked in patients negative for HFE genotypes predisposing to iron overload (p.Cys282Tyr + and p.His63Asp +/+; p = 0.01), and the p.736Val variant was negatively associated with hepatic iron accumulation independently of age, gender, HFE genotype, and beta-thalassemia trait (OR 0.59, 0.39-0.88). The p.Ala736Val TMPRSS6 variant influences secondary hepatic iron accumulation in patients with NAFLD.	23144979
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hyperferritinemia increases the risk of hyperuricemia in HFE-hereditary hemochromatosis.	Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme	2016	2.95	Hyperuricemia is becoming increasingly frequent in the population, and is known to be sometimes the cause of gout. The impact of uric acid is still not clearly understood, however. The iron metabolism may interact with the uric acid metabolism. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the serum uric acid and serum ferritin levels in a cohort of hemochromatosis patients who were homozygous for the HFE p.Cys282Tyr mutation. 738 patients with the HFE gene mutation Cys282Tyr in the homozygous state were included in the study. The variables measured during the initial evaluation were compared in univariate analysis by Student's t test. In multivariate analysis, linear stepwise regression was used. In the group of hyperuricemic patients, ferritinemia was significantly higher than in the group of non-hyperuricemic patients (1576.7±1387.4μg/l vs. 1095.63±1319.24μg/l, P<0.005). With multivariate analysis, only ferritin and BMI independently explained the uricemia (R 2 =0.258) after adjustment for age, glycemia and CRP. The correlation between uricemia and log(ferritin) with partial regression correlation coefficients was 0.307 (P<0.01). The increase in uricemia is associated with the increase in ferritin in a population of patients who were homozygous for the HFE gene mutation p.Cys282Tyr and this independently of factors commonly associated with hyperuricemia. The increase in uric acid associated with hyperferritinemia, could be a response to the visceral toxicity of excess non-transferrin bound iron linked to oxidative stress via the antioxidant properties of uric acid.	27659401
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Next-generation sequencing of hereditary hemochromatosis-related genes: Novel likely pathogenic variants found in the Portuguese population.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2016	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption resulting in pathologically increased body iron stores. It is typically associated with common HFE gene mutation (p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp). However, in Southern European populations up to one third of HH patients do not carry the risk genotypes. This study aimed to explore the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to analyse a panel of iron metabolism-related genes (HFE, TFR2, HJV, HAMP, SLC40A1, and FTL) in 87 non-classic HH Portuguese patients. A total of 1241 genetic alterations were detected corresponding to 53 different variants, 13 of which were not described in the available public databases. Among them, five were predicted to be potentially pathogenic: three novel mutations in TFR2 [two missense (p.Leu750Pro and p.Ala777Val) and one intronic splicing mutation (c.967-1G>C)], one missense mutation in HFE (p.Tyr230Cys), and one mutation in the 5'-UTR of HAMP gene (c.-25G>A). The results reported here illustrate the usefulness of NGS for targeted iron metabolism-related gene panels, as a likely cost-effective approach for molecular genetics diagnosis of non-classic HH patients. Simultaneously, it has contributed to the knowledge of the pathophysiology of those rare iron metabolism-related disorders.	27667161
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis screening: effect of mutation penetrance and prevalence on cost-effectiveness of testing algorithms.	Clinical genetics	2007	3.89	Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, although largely discussed, is not yet implemented in clinical practice. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 165 hemochromatosis population-screening algorithms involving two or three of several screening tests by developing a computer program that simulates all possible screening scenarios. Input data comprised government estimates of health services data and costs and a virtual population with user-defined demographic characteristics (including variable HFE mutation frequencies and penetrance values). We show that when C282Y homozygote prevalence is set at 3:1000, population screening appears cost-effective when penetrance of the biochemical phenotype is >0.70. When only hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis are considered as the cost-driving complications, population-based screening is not significantly more cost-efficient than no screening, but life expectancy of individuals identified with hereditary hemochromatosis and treated is still improved by 7 years. Among the 165 screening algorithms tested in 91 different virtual populations of one million individuals, biochemical tests usually perform better as the initial test than genetic testing. Indeed, the genetic testing is most cost-effective as the final confirmatory test. Finally, for most combinations of prevalence and penetrance of HFE, one screening algorithm--unbound iron-binding capacity + transferrin saturation--appeared robust enough to be always within the top 5 most cost-effective strategies.	17204047
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effects of alcohol consumption on iron metabolism in mice with hemochromatosis mutations.	Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research	2007	0.5	Alcoholic liver disease is associated with increased hepatic iron accumulation. The liver-derived peptide hepcidin is the central regulator of iron homeostasis and recent animal studies have demonstrated that exposure to alcohol reduces hepcidin expression. This down-regulation of hepcidin in vivo implies that disturbed iron sensing may contribute to the hepatosiderosis seen in alcoholic liver disease. Alcohol intake is also a major factor in expression of the hemochromatosis phenotype in patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. To assess the effect of alcohol in mice with iron overload, alcohol was administered to mice with disrupted Hfe and IL-6 genes and Tfr2 mutant mice and their respective 129x1/SvJ, C57BL/6J, and AKR/J wild-type congenic strains. Iron absorption, serum iron levels, and hepcidin expression levels were then measured in these mice compared with water-treated control mice. Alcohol was shown to have a strain-specific effect in 129x1/SvJ mice, with treated 129x1/SvJ mice showing a significant increase in iron absorption, serum iron levels, and a corresponding decrease in hepcidin expression. C57BL/6J and AKR/J strain mice showed no effect from alcohol treatment. 129x1/SvJ mice heterozygous or homozygous for the Hfe knockout had a diminished response to alcohol. All 3 strains were shown to have high blood alcohol levels. The effect of alcohol on iron homeostasis is dependent on the genetic background in mice. In an alcohol-susceptible strain, mutation of the Hfe gene diminished the response of the measured iron indices to alcohol treatment. This indicates that either maximal suppression of hepcidin levels had already occurred as a result of the Hfe mutation or that Hfe was a component of the pathway utilized by EtOH in suppressing hepcidin production and increasing iron absorption.	17207112
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis gene (HFE) polymorphisms and migraine: an association study.	Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache	2007	6.05	Several studies have suggested that iron metabolism may be involved in the pathogenesis of migraine. Using a case-control design, we performed an association study in a cohort of Italian migraine patients to evaluate whether a particular allele or genotype of the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) would modify the occurrence and clinical features of the disease. We genotyped 256 migraine patients and 237 healthy age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched controls for the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms of the HFE gene. Phenotype and allele frequencies of both polymorphisms were similarly distributed in migraine patients and controls. The patients carrying the DD genotype of the H63D polymorphism showed a later age at onset of the disease and an increased number of migraine attacks. Our data suggest that the HFE gene is not a major disease gene for migraine. However, the H63D polymorphism of the HFE gene may be considered a modifying genetic factor in migraine.	17212677
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Heterozygosis H63D in patients with steatohepatitis and chronic hepatitis C].	La Clinica terapeutica		0.5	Classic hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive iron-overload disorder associated with mutation of the HFE gene. The homozygous genetic defect predisposes to a chain of events that may culminate in severe damage in multiple organs. Pathologic implications of heterozygous defect are still questionable; in fact since these individuals may have slight increases in intra-cellular iron, it has been questioned whether this would enhance damage from other diseases. We investigated whether steatohepatitis and chronic hepatitis C can be worsened by heterozygosis for C282Y and H63D. We investigated 216 subjects with Steatohepatitis and/or chronic hepatitis C diagnosed by ultrasonography and liver biopsy with histological assessment compared with 110 healthy subjects. In all subjects we performed Saturated Transferrine, Plasma Ferritin and the research of HFE mutation by a Real Time Method. A statistical analysis was performed. A H63D mutation was present in 32/108 patients with Steatohepatitis, in 30/108 patients with chronic hepatitis C and in 22/110 healthy subjects. A C282Y mutation was present in 2/108 patients with chronic hepatitis C, in 4/108 with steatohepatitis and in 2/108 healthy subjects. No significant difference was present about incidence of this mutation between pathological and healthy subjects. No significant differences have observed between pathological groups and normal group about the degree of histological damage. Our study revealed that steatohepatitis and chronic hepatitis C cannot be worsened by heterozygosis for C282Y and H63D.	17228846
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Left ventricular systolic function during stress echocardiography exercise in subjects with asymptomatic hereditary hemochromatosis.	The American journal of cardiology	2006	0.5	There is no information available on left ventricular (LV) systolic function and the response to stress echocardiography in asymptomatic subjects with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). To evaluate this topic, 43 asymptomatic subjects with HH homozygous for the C282Y HFE gene mutation (22 untreated subjects [group A] and 21 long-term treated subjects [group B]) were compared with 21 age- and gender-matched normal volunteers negative for HFE mutations. Contractile reserve, as a measure of LV systolic function, was assessed using continuous echocardiographic imaging and electrocardiography during supine bicycle exercise. Nineteen subjects in group A had repeat tests after 6 months of induction phlebotomy therapy to assess the effect of iron removal. Exercise performance and hemodynamic variables of supine bicycle exercise were comparable between subjects with HH and controls. LV contractile reserve of asymptomatic subjects with HH was not impaired at either a 75-W submaximal exercise level (mean +/- SD difference in ejection fraction from baseline 13.8 +/- 6.2%, 11.5 +/- 6.8%, and 13.4 +/- 7.8% in groups A, B, and C, respectively; p = NS for all by analysis of variance) or at peak exercise (difference in ejection fraction from baseline 18.9 +/- 6.9%, 18.4 +/- 7.8%, and 20.3 +/- 8.1% in groups A, B, and C, respectively; p = NS for all by analysis of variance). However, the incidence of abnormal ischemic stress electrocardiographic responses was more frequent in subjects with HH as a whole (33%) compared with normal subjects (10%). Stress imaging revealed no regional wall motion abnormalities, suggesting that these were false-positive results. Iron removal by induction phlebotomy did not affect stress echocardiographic performance. In conclusion, LV systolic function during exercise in asymptomatic subjects with HH is preserved, and 6-month induction phlebotomy does not affect stress echocardiographic performance.	16923464
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for mutations of the HFE gene in Parkinson's disease patients with hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra.	Neuroscience letters	2006	2.11	Iron mediated oxidative stress is known to contribute to the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease (PD). Although there are hints that genes involved in brain iron metabolism might be involved in the pathogenesis of PD in some instances, it is still not known whether the increase in brain iron content constitutes a primary or secondary event in the disease cascade. Recent studies on the role of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations in PD vary from a protective effect of C282Y heterozygosity, no effect of the C282Y or H63D mutation to an increased risk for PD in C282Y mutation carriers. In this study, analyzing the whole coding region of the HFE gene by dHPLC in 278 PD patients, priorly characterized by transcranial sonography for increased iron content of the substantia nigra (SN), we did not find an association of the common HFE mutations and PD. However, we identified two novel variants (K92N and I217T) each in a single PD patient. These variations were not found in any of the controls. Future studies are necessary to reveal a possible functional relevance of these mutations for PD. Our results indicate that mutations in the HFE gene are not a common cause for PD with increased iron levels of the SN.	16935420
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Relationships of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and HFE mutations and self-reported diabetes in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) study.	Diabetes care	2006	8.93	We evaluated the associations of self-reported diabetes with serum ferritin concentration, transferrin saturation (TfSat), and HFE C282Y and H63D mutations in six racial/ethnic groups recruited at five field centers in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) study. Analyses were conducted on 97,470 participants. Participants who reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes and/or hemochromatosis or iron overload were compared with participants who did not report a previous diagnosis. The overall prevalence of diabetes was 13.8%; the highest prevalence was in Pacific Islanders (20.1%). Of all participants with diabetes, 2.0% reported that they also had hemochromatosis or iron overload. The mean serum ferritin concentration was significantly greater in women with diabetes in all racial/ethnic groups and in Native-American men with diabetes than in those without diabetes. The mean serum ferritin concentration was significantly lower in Asian men with diabetes than in those without diabetes. Mean TfSat was lower in participants with diabetes from all racial/ethnic groups except Native-American women than in those without diabetes. There was no significant association of diabetes with HFE genotype. The mean serum ferritin concentration was greater (P < 0.0001) in women with diabetes than in those without diabetes for HFE genotypes except C282Y/C282Y and C282Y/H63D. Log serum ferritin concentration was significantly associated with diabetes in a logistic regression analysis after adjusting for age, sex, racial/ethnic group, HFE genotype, and field center. Serum ferritin concentration is associated with diabetes, even at levels below those typically associated with hemochromatosis or iron overload.	16936157
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepatic iron overload in alcoholic end-stage liver disease is associated with iron deposition in other organs in the absence of HFE-1 hemochromatosis.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2005	4.47	End-stage cirrhosis in the absence of hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) can be associated with moderate to marked hepatic iron overload, especially in liver disease as a result of alcohol and/or hepatitis C. However, no published studies have addressed extrahepatic iron deposition in this setting. A retrospective case series from three autopsied patients who died from end-stage cirrhosis associated with significant hepatic iron overload. Histology of vital organs was performed to detect extrahepatic iron deposition. HFE genotyping for the C282Y and H63D mutations was determined from archival tissue. Hepatic iron index and hepatic iron concentration (HIC) were quantified from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Medical records were reviewed for possible causes of iron overload. Two patients were H63D heterozygous (H63D +/-) and one was wild type (C282Y -/-, H63D -/-). Histology revealed evidence of stainable iron in the heart and pancreas of all three subjects. Additionally, stainable iron was seen in the stomach in one subject and in the thyroid, pituitary, choroid plexus and testes in another subject. HIC ranged from 4354 to 6834 microg/g dry weight and HII from 1.8 to 2.2 (micromol/g/years). Iron overload secondary to end-stage liver disease can be associated with iron deposition in other organs in the absence of HFE-1 HHC.	15910487
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Basal cell carcinoma and variants in genes coding for immune response, DNA repair, folate and iron metabolism.	Mutation research	2005	0.5	Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is one of the most common neoplasms in the world and its incidence has been increasing worldwide in recent years. BCCs are caused by an interplay between genetic and environment factors. We conducted a case-control association study in BCC patients and controls from Sweden and Finland. Fifteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), IL-6-174G/C, -634G/C, and -597G/A; IL-10-1082G/A and -592C/A; IL-1beta-511C/T; NBS1 exon 5 Glu185Gln; XPC exon 15 Lys939Gln; XPD exon 23 Lys751Gln; XRCC1 exon 10 Arg399Gln; XRCC3 exon 7 Thr241Met; cyclin D1 exon 4 G870A; MTHFR exon 4 Ala222Val and exon 7 Glu429Ala; HFE exon 4 C282Y were performed by Pyrosequencing and RFLP techniques. Most of the genotype distributions were in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), except for IL-10-1082G/A, where cases with BCC showed a significant deviation from HWE (P = 0.04). Linkage disequilibrium was observed between the -174 and -597 alleles in the IL-6 gene in the present populations. No difference between BCC and controls appeared in any of the SNPs analyzed. Only the combined distributions of TT/AA genotypes in MTHFR exon 4 (C/T) and exon 7 (A/C) showed slight increase in BCC compared to controls (P < 0.07, OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 0.96-3.89).	15914210
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[HFE hemochromatosis: pathogenic and diagnostic approach].	Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine	2005	0.56	HFE hemochromatosis is the most frequent genetic iron overload disease. It is linked to the C282Y mutation of the HFE protein, protein encoded by the HFE gene, which is located on chromosome 6. The mechanisms accounting for iron excess are not only digestive hyperabsorption of iron but also excessive recycling of macrophagic iron coming from erythrophagocytosis and secreted into the blood. Both mechanisms are linked to an HFE-related hepatic failure in producing hepcidin, a key hormone of body iron regulation. The marked phenotypic variability of C282Y homozygosity expression is likely related to both genetic and environmental factors. The HFE gene discovery has rendered non invasive the positive diagnostic of HFE hemochromatosis, which is now based first on an increased level of plasma transferrin saturation leading to the request of the HFE mutation. Then, hepatic MRI is a reliable method to quantify iron overload. The HFE gene discovery has also paved the road of an enlarged field of differential diagnoses corresponding to novel entities of non-HFE related genetic iron overload syndromes.	15925529
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Bone mineral density in men with genetic hemochromatosis and HFE gene mutation.	Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA	2005	3.44	Genetic hemochromatosis (GH) is an iron overload disorder mainly due to the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. The possibility of bone involvement was only recently recognized. The aims of this study were to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and bone remodeling in men with GH, and to examine the influence of iron overload. Thirty-eight men (mean age 47.2+/-9.4 years) with well-defined HFE-related GH were studied. They had an important iron overload with liver iron concentration to age ratio >2.5, no previous venesection therapy and were C282Y homozygotes (n=37) or compound C282Y/H63D heterozygote (n=1). BMD measured by DXA was 0.925+/-0.15 g/cm2 at the lumbar spine (LS) and 0.778+/-0.13 g/cm2 at the femoral neck (FN). Osteopenia (T-score<-1 SD) was observed in 78.9% of patients and osteoporosis (T-score<-2.5 SD) in 34.2%. Vitamin D levels were normal, and no 1-84 parathyroid hormone dysfunction was found. Hypogonadism was found in only 13.2% of patients. Patients with hypogonadism had lower LS BMD than eugonadal patients (0.788+/-0.16 and 0.954+/-0.14 g/cm2). Bone remodeling and parathyroid hormone levels were lower in patients with cirrhosis, but BMD values were similar to those in patients without cirrhosis. FN BMD appeared to fall with rising hepatic iron concentrations (r=-0.399). We conclude that there is significant bone loss in HFE-related hemochromatosis that cannot solely be explained by hypogonadism or cirrhosis. Further investigations are needed to determine the role of iron overload itself.	15928800
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Occult celiac disease prevents penetrance of hemochromatosis.	World journal of gastroenterology	2005	2.79	To report a patient with C282Y homozygocity, depleted body iron and intestinal atrophy caused by celiac disease (CD) who experienced resolution of the enteropathy with subsequent normalization of iron metabolism upon gluten-free diet. To obtain information on the tissue distribution and quantitative expression of proteins involved in duodenal iron trafficking, we determined the expression of divalent-metal transporter 1 (DMT1), ferroportin 1 (FP1) and transferrin receptor (TfR1) by means of immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR in duodenal biopsies of this patient. Whereas in hereditary hemochromatosis patients without CD, DMT1 expression was up-regulated leading to excessive uptake of iron, we identified a significant reduction in protein and mRNA expression of DMT1 as a compensatory mechanism in this patient with HH and CD. Occult CD may compensate for increased DMT1 expression in a specific subset of individuals with homozygous C282Y mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene, thus contributing to the low penetrance of HH.	15929194
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepatocellular carcinoma and the penetrance of HFE C282Y mutations: a cross sectional study.	BMC gastroenterology	2005	2.1	Although most patients with hereditary haemochromatosis have HFE C282Y mutations, the lifetime risk to HFE C282Y homozygotes of developing fatal diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma is uncertain. We have carried out a cross-sectional study to determine the proportion of diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma patients who are homozygous for the HFE C282Y mutation; and to estimate the penetrance of this genotype with respect to hepatocellular carcinoma in East Anglia. Tissue biopsies were analysed from 144 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma for HFE C282Y mutations; the data produced were compared with the frequency of HFE mutations in a large sample of the local population. Data were also retrieved from the East Anglian Cancer Intelligence Unit to determine the annual incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma; and from appropriate life tables. Eight out of 144 of the cases were homozygous for the HFE C282Y mutation, all 8 cases were male. 6 of these 8 cases had a previous diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis. Male HFE C282Y homozygotes were more likely to be diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (odds ratio [OR] = 14, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5-37). For this population, we estimate that the penetrance of the HFE C282Y homozygous genotype, with respect to hepatocellular carcinoma, was between 1.31 % and 2.1% for males and was zero for females. In this population, we found that only a very small proportion of homozygotes for the HFE C282Y mutation developed hepatocellular carcinoma. However, individuals with this genotype have a significantly increased risk of this rare disease relative to those who do not carry the mutations.	15929796
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Impact of HFE genetic testing on clinical presentation of hereditary hemochromatosis: new epidemiological data.	BMC medical genetics	2005	2.09	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common inherited disorder of iron metabolism in Northern European populations. The discovery of a candidate gene in 1996 (HFE), and of its main mutation (C282Y), has radically altered the way to diagnose this disease. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of the HFE gene discovery on the clinical presentation and epidemiology of HH. We studied our cohort of 415 patients homozygous for the C282Y allele and included in a phlebotomy program in a blood centre in western Brittany, France. In this cohort, 56.9% of the patients were male and 21.9% began their phlebotomy program before the implementation of the genetic test. A significant decrease in the sex ratio was noticed following implementation of this DNA test, from 3.79 to 1.03 (p < 10(-5)), meaning that the proportion of diagnosed females relatives to males greatly increased. The profile of HH patients at diagnosis changed after the DNA test became available. Serum ferritin and iron values were lower and there was a reduced frequency of clinical signs displayed at diagnosis, particularly skin pigmentation (20.1 vs. 40.4%, OR = 0.37, p < 0.001) and hepatomegaly (11.0 vs. 22.7%, OR = 0.42, p = 0.006). In contrast, fatigue became a more common symptom at diagnosis (68.0 vs. 51.2%, OR = 2.03, p = 0.004). This study highlights the importance of the HFE gene discovery, which has simplified the diagnosis of HH and modified its clinical presentation and epidemiology. This study precisely measures these changes. Enhanced diagnosis of HFE-related HH at an early stage and implementation of phlebotomy treatment are anticipated to maintain normal life expectancy for these patients.	15929798
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Molecular diagnosis of hemochromatosis.	Expert opinion on medical diagnostics	2013	0.5	The discovery of hemochromatosis genes and the availability of molecular-genetic tests considerably modified the knowledge of the disease relative to physiopathology, penetrance, and expression, and had major impact in the diagnostic settings. Hemochromatosis is a heterogenous disorder at both genetic and phenotypic level. The review discusses criteria to define patients' iron phenotype and to use molecular tests to diagnose HFE-related and non-HFE hemochromatosis. The material examined includes articles published in the journals covered by PubMed US National Library of Medicine. The author has been working in the field of iron overload diseases for several years and has contributed 18 of the papers cited in the references. Hemochromatosis genotyping is inseparable from phenotype characterization. A full clinical assessment is needed and DNA test performed when data suggest a clear indication of suspicion of being at risk for HH. HFE testing for p.Cys282Tyr mutation and p.His63Asp variant is the first molecular diagnostic step. Genotyping for rare mutations can be offered to patients with negative first-level HFE testing who have iron overload with no other explanation and should be performed in referral centers for iron overload disorders that can provide genetic advice and in-house genotyping services.	23530886

In the mammalian central nervous system, oligodendrocytes express Cx47, Cx32 and Cx29, whereas astrocytes express Cx43, Cx30 and Cx26. Homotypic Cx47/Cx47 GJs couple oligodendrocytes, and heterotypic Cx47/Cx43 channels are the primary GJs at oligodendrocyte/astrocyte junctions. Interestingly, autosomal recessive mutations in the gene GJC2 encoding Cx47 have been linked to a central hypomyelinating disease termed PMLD (Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease). The aim of the present study was to determine the cellular distribution and functional properties of PMLD-associated Cx47 mutants (I46M, G149S, G236R, G236S, M286T and T398I). Expressing GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged mutant versions of Cx47 in gap-junction-deficient model cells revealed that these mutants were detected at the cell-cell interface similar to that observed for wild-type Cx47. Furthermore, four of the six mutants showed no electrical coupling in both Cx47/Cx47 and Cx47/Cx43 GJ channels. These results suggest that most of the PMLD-linked Cx47 mutants disrupt Cx47/Cx47 and Cx47/Cx43 GJ function in the glial network, which may play a role in leading to PMLD symptoms.	23544880
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations and risk of gastric cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study.	Carcinogenesis	2013	4.87	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a strong risk factor for hepatocellular cancer, and mutations in the HFE gene associated with HH and iron overload may be related to other tumors, but no studies have been reported for gastric cancer (GC). A nested case-control study was conducted within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), including 365 incident gastric adenocarcinoma and 1284 controls matched by center, sex, age and date of blood collection. Genotype analysis was performed for two functional polymorphisms (C282Y/rs1800562 and H63D/rs1799945) and seven tagSNPs of the HFE genomic region. Association with all gastric adenocarcinoma, and according to anatomical localization and histological subtype, was assessed by means of the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimated by unconditional logistic regression adjusted for the matching variables. We observed a significant association for H63D with OR (per rare allele) of 1.32 (CI = 1.03-1.69). In subgroup analyses, the association was stronger for non-cardia anatomical subsite (OR = 1.60, CI = 1.16-2.21) and intestinal histological subtype (OR = 1.82, CI = 1.27-2.62). Among intestinal cases, two tagSNPs (rs1572982 and rs6918586) also showed a significant association that disappeared after adjustment for H63D. No association with tumors located in the cardia or with diffuse subtype was found for any of the nine SNPs analyzed. Our results suggest that H63D variant in HFE gene seems to be associated with GC risk of the non-cardia region and intestinal type, possibly due to its association with iron overload although a role for other mechanisms cannot be entirely ruled out.	23389292
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haplotype Analysis of Hemochromatosis Gene Polymorphisms in Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection: A Case Control Study.	Iranian Red Crescent medical journal	2016	0.68	Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is frequently associated with elevated serum iron markers. Polymorphisms in the hemochromatosis (HFE) genes are responsible for iron accumulation in most cases of hemochromatosis, and may play a role in HCV infection. We aimed to assess the prevalence of HFE gene polymorphisms in a group of Iranian HCV-infected patients, and to explore the association of these polymorphisms with HCV infection. HFE gene polymorphisms were examined in a total of 69 HCV patients and 69 healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques. Haplotype and diplotype analyses were performed using PHASE software. In a recessive analysis model of the His63Asp (H63D) locus (HH vs. HD + DD), the HH genotype was more common in patients compared to controls (adjusted P = 0.012; OR = 6.42 [95% CI: 1.51 - 27.33]). Also, in a recessive analysis model of the Cys282Tyr (C282Y) locus (CC vs. CY + YY), the CC genotype was more frequent in patients compared to controls (adjusted P = 0.03; OR = 5.06 [95% CI: 1.13 - 22.06]). In addition, there was a significant association between the HC haplotype and the HCDC diplotype and HCV infection. Polymorphism in the hemochromatosis gene may confer some degree of risk for HCV infection, and individuals carrying the H and C alleles may be susceptible to this disease; however, a larger sample of HCV patients and healthy individuals may be necessary to further illustrate the role of these polymorphisms in HCV.	27621921
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Cystathionine beta-synthase mutants exhibit changes in protein unfolding: conformational analysis of misfolded variants in crude cell extracts.	Journal of inherited metabolic disease	2012	3.54	Protein misfolding has been proposed to be a common pathogenic mechanism in many inborn errors of metabolism including cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency. In this work, we describe the structural properties of nine CBS mutants that represent a common molecular pathology in the CBS gene. Using thermolysin in two proteolytic techniques, we examined conformation of these mutants directly in crude cell extracts after expression in E. coli. Proteolysis with thermolysin under native conditions appeared to be a useful technique even for very unstable mutant proteins, whereas pulse proteolysis in a urea gradient had limited values for the study of the majority of CBS mutants due to their instability. Mutants in the active core had either slightly increased unfolding (p.A114V, p.E302K and p.G307S) or extensive unfolding with decreased stability (p.H65R, p.T191M, p.I278T and p.R369C). The extent of the unfolding inversely correlated with the previously determined degree of tetrameric assembly and with the catalytic activity. In contrast, mutants bearing aminoacid substitutions in the C-terminal regulatory domain (p.R439Q and p.D444N) had increased global stability with decreased flexibility. This study shows that proteolytic techniques can reveal conformational abnormalities even for CBS mutants that have activity and/or a degree of assembly similar to the wild-type enzyme. We present here a methodological strategy that may be used in cell lysates to evaluate properties of proteins that tend to misfold and aggregate and that may be important for conformational studies of disease-causing mutations in the field of inborn errors of metabolism.	22069143
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Associations of iron metabolism genes with blood manganese levels: a population-based study with validation data from animal models.	Environmental health : a global access science source	2011	3.45	Given mounting evidence for adverse effects from excess manganese exposure, it is critical to understand host factors, such as genetics, that affect manganese metabolism. Archived blood samples, collected from 332 Mexican women at delivery, were analyzed for manganese. We evaluated associations of manganese with functional variants in three candidate iron metabolism genes: HFE [hemochromatosis], TF [transferrin], and ALAD [δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase]. We used a knockout mouse model to parallel our significant results as a novel method of validating the observed associations between genotype and blood manganese in our epidemiologic data. Percentage of participants carrying at least one copy of HFE C282Y, HFE H63D, TF P570S, and ALAD K59N variant alleles was 2.4%, 17.7%, 20.1%, and 6.4%, respectively. Percentage carrying at least one copy of either C282Y or H63D allele in HFE gene was 19.6%. Geometric mean (geometric standard deviation) manganese concentrations were 17.0 (1.5) μg/l. Women with any HFE variant allele had 12% lower blood manganese concentrations than women with no variant alleles (β = -0.12 [95% CI = -0.23 to -0.01]). TF and ALAD variants were not significant predictors of blood manganese. In animal models, Hfe(-/-) mice displayed a significant reduction in blood manganese compared with Hfe(+/+) mice, replicating the altered manganese metabolism found in our human research. Our study suggests that genetic variants in iron metabolism genes may contribute to variability in manganese exposure by affecting manganese absorption, distribution, or excretion. Genetic background may be critical to consider in studies that rely on environmental manganese measurements.	22074419
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A novel Y231del mutation of HFE in hereditary haemochromatosis provides in vivo evidence that the Huh-7 is a human haemochromatotic cell line.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2011	4.47	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH), which is mainly associated with a C282Y polymorphism in HFE, is common among Caucasians of north European descent, but is very rare among Asians. Herein, we report a 43-year-old Japanese man who was diagnosed as having HH. A laboratory examination revealed an elevated serum iron level (280 μg/dl), hyperferritinemia (1698 ng/ml) and a low serum level of hepcidin-25 (4.0 ng/ml). Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed findings suggestive of iron accumulation in the liver and pancreas. HFE gene sequencing in the patient revealed a novel homozygous TAC nucleotide deletion (c. 691_693del) responsible for the loss of a tyrosine at position 231 (p. Y231del) of the HFE protein. This homozygous Y231del mutation was recently found in the Huh-7 hepatoma cell line and was shown to prevent the translocation of HFE to the cell surface. This clinical case provides in vivo evidence suggesting that Huh-7 is undoubtedly a human haemochromatotic cell line and, as such, is a valuable tool for investigating the pathogenesis of HFE-related HH in humans.	22093335
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	C282Y-HFE gene variant affects cholesterol metabolism in human neuroblastoma cells.	PloS one	2014	3.06	Although disruptions in the maintenance of iron and cholesterol metabolism have been implicated in several cancers, the association between variants in the HFE gene that is associated with cellular iron uptake and cholesterol metabolism has not been studied. The C282Y-HFE variant is a risk factor for different cancers, is known to affect sphingolipid metabolism, and to result in increased cellular iron uptake. The effect of this variant on cholesterol metabolism and its possible relevance to cancer phenotype was investigated using wild type (WT) and C282Y-HFE transfected human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Expression of C282Y-HFE in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in a significant increase in total cholesterol as well as increased transcription of a number of genes involved in its metabolism compared to cells expressing WT-HFE. The marked increase in expression of NPC1L1 relative to that of most other genes, was accompanied by a significant increase in expression of NPC1, a protein that functions in cholesterol uptake by cells. Because inhibitors of cholesterol metabolism have been proposed to be beneficial for treating certain cancers, their effect on the viability of C282Y-HFE neuroblastoma cells was ascertained. C282Y-HFE cells were significantly more sensitive than WT-HFE cells to U18666A, an inhibitor of desmosterol Δ24-reductase the enzyme catalyzing the last step in cholesterol biosynthesis. This was not seen for simvastatin, ezetimibe, or a sphingosine kinase inhibitor. These studies indicate that cancers presenting in carriers of the C282Y-HFE allele might be responsive to treatment designed to selectively reduce cholesterol content in their tumor cells.	24533143
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis gene mutations and risk of coronary heart disease: a west of Scotland coronary prevention study (WOSCOPS) substudy.	Heart (British Cardiac Society)	2004	0.5	To measure the frequency of genotypes of the HFE (haemochromatosis) gene in patients recruited to the west of Scotland coronary prevention study (WOSCOPS), and relate them to the subsequent occurrence of coronary clinical events. Nested case-control study, drawing samples of DNA from the biological bank of a cohort study. Men aged 45-64 years in 1989, with moderate hypercholesterolaemia and no evidence of coronary heart disease at baseline. Follow up for a mean period of 4.9 years. Typing for C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene in 482 subjects with a subsequent coronary event and 1104 without an event. The C282Y mutation was present in 81 of 482 cases (16.8%) and 182 of 1104 controls (16.5%). Comparing the prevalence of gene mutations in the cases and controls, there were no significant differences. The hazard ratio for C282Y heterozygotes was 1.03 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.36) and for C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes 1.04 (95% CI 0.50 to 2.14). Prespecified subgroup analyses of the pravastatin, placebo, smoking, and non-smoking groups showed no significant differences between cases and controls. Repeating the analyses after adjusting for possible confounding factors produced no change in the results. In a population of moderately hypercholesterolaemic middle aged Scottish men who did not have any evidence of coronary heart disease at baseline, the presence of a C282Y mutation in the HFE gene did not predict the occurrence of coronary events over a mean follow up of 4.9 years.	14966054
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[HFE gene mutations, hepatic iron content, and histological severity in hepatitis C virus-induced chronic hepatitis].	Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva	2003	1.46	To study whether any relationship exists between the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene, iron liver content, and the severity of histological damage in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced chronic hepatitis. In 72 patients diagnosed with HCV-chronic infection, naïve for antiviral therapy, and undergoing liver biopsy, the Knodell index was established, a morphometric evaluation of hepatic hemosiderin deposits was performed by using a semiautomatic method of image analysis, and mutations of the HFE gene were identified through a polymerase chain reaction on leukocyte genomic DNA by using specific restriction enzymes. The control group for the distribution of HFE genetic variants was composed of 181 healthy individuals with the same ethnic and geographical (white Spaniards) origin. (Cases/controls): 1. Genotype distribution: a) mutation C282Y: no homozygotes, 6/23 heterozygotes, 66/158 without the mutation (not significant, n.s.); b) mutation H63D: 2/5 homozygotes, 26/52 heterozygotes, 44/124 without the mutation (n.s.). compound heterozygotes 2/6. 2. Allele frequencies: a) mutation C282Y: 0.042/0.064 (n.s.); b) mutation H63D: 0.208/0.171 (n.s.). Four C282Y heterozygous patients had stainable liver iron (p=0.015 vs patients without mutations). Sixty-six patients were not carriers of the C282Y mutation; among them, 26.9% of 26 carriers and 15% of 40 non-carriers of the H63D mutation had liver stainable iron (n.s.). Knodell index score, gender, age at diagnosis, mode of transmission, and serum and liver iron values were not related to the HFE genotype. our results suggest that the C282Y mutation, but not the H63D mutation, of the HFE gene is frequently associated with stainable iron in the liver in HCV-related chronic hepatitis. The HFE genotype is not related to the histological severity of the disease.	14972004
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Characterization of cystathionine beta-synthase gene mutations in homocystinuric Venezuelan patients: identification of one novel mutation in exon 6.	Molecular genetics and metabolism	2004	3.09	This study describes for the first time the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene mutations in Venezuelan patients. A total of five disease-causing mutations were identified in 9 out of 10 independent chromosomes. Four of the mutations have been previously described (G85R, T191M, D234N, and D444N) and a novel mutation was found (Q243X). Two common polymorphisms (699C/T and 1080C/T) were found in the CBS gene. Mutation analysis was performed using a combined screening approach for CBS mutations: restriction analysis, single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) scanning, and sequencing. All the mutations were detected in homozygous state, except for Q243X, detected in three heterozygous siblings. Each one of the patients studied presented a different mutation. All mutations and polymorphisms detected involved hypermutable CpG sites, except for the novel mutation Q243X. The most common mutations I278T and G307S were not found in any of the patients. The CBS mutations present in each country differ from each other depending on the demographic profile; therefore, specific mutations scanning must be performed in each population for diagnosis and prognosis purposes.	14972327
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased prevalence of the HFE C282Y hemochromatosis allele in women with breast cancer.	Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology	2004	3.62	Individuals with the major hemochromatosis (HFE) allele C282Y and iron overload develop hepatocellular and some extrahepatic malignancies at increased rates. No association has been previously reported between the C282Y allele and breast cancer. We hypothesized that due to the pro-oxidant properties of iron, altered iron metabolism in C282Y carriers may promote breast carcinogenesis. Because 1 in 10 Caucasians of Northern European ancestry carries this allele, any impact it may have on breast cancer burden is potentially great. We determined C282Y genotypes in 168 patients who underwent high-dose chemotherapy and blood cell transplantation for cancer: 41 with breast cancer and 127 with predominantly hematological cancers (transplant cohort). Demographic, clinical, and tumor characteristics were reviewed in breast cancer patients. The frequency of C282Y genotypes in breast cancers was compared with the frequency in nonbreast cancers, an outpatient sample from Tennessee (n = 169), and a published United States national sample. The frequency of at least one C282Y allele in breast cancers was higher (36.6%, 5 homozygotes/10 heterozygotes) than frequencies in Tennessee (12.7%, P < 0.001), the general population (12.4%, P < 0.001), and similarly selected nonbreast cancers (17.0%, P = 0.008). The likelihood of breast cancer in the transplant cohort increased with C282Y allele dose (P(trend) = 0.010). These results were supported by the finding in a nontransplant cohort of a higher frequency of C282Y mutations in Caucasian (18.4%, P = 0.039) and African-American (8.5%, P = 0.005) women with breast cancer than race-specific national frequency estimates. A high prevalence of C282Y alleles in women with breast cancer with and without poor risk features suggests that altered iron metabolism in C282Y carriers may promote the development of breast cancer and/or more aggressive forms of the disease.	14973098
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene mutations among Finnish male breast and prostate cancer patients.	International journal of cancer	2006	5.53	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), the most common genetic disease in northern Europeans, is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism. The association between hepatocellular carcinoma and HFE homozygosity is well documented, but recently HFE hetero- and homozygosity has also been linked to nonhepatocellular malignancies, including female breast cancer. We hypothesized that C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene could contribute to male breast cancer (MBC) and prostate cancer (PC) susceptibility at the population level in Finland. We screened the 2 major HFE mutations, H63D and C282Y, from 116 MBC cases diagnosed in Finland between 1967 and 1996, 843 consecutive unselected PC cases diagnosed at the Pirkanmaa Hospital District between 1999 and 2001 and 480 anonymous blood donor controls by minisequencing. Our results indicate that the frequencies of the HFE mutations do not significantly differ between MBC and PC patients and the population-based controls. No significantly altered risks for MBC or PC among carriers of the 2 variants were observed. However, HFE mutations were seen twice as often among carriers of a common BRCA2 mutation 9346(-2)A-->G compared with the rest of the MBC cases, indicating that HFE may be an MBC risk modifier gene among BRCA2 mutation carriers. In conclusion, our results indicate a minor role for the HFE mutations C282Y and H63D in the causation of MBC and PC, but carriers of both BRCA2 9346(-2)A-->G and an HFE mutation may be at an increased risk.	16003728
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Do cancer cells selectively mutate HFE to increase their intracellular iron?	Oncology reports	2005	2.49	Malignant cells compared to their normal counter-parts, have an increased requirement for iron in order to achieve an enhanced cell growth. Transferrin receptor (TfR), an essential transport protein that enables cells to satisfy their need of iron, is upregulated in cancer cells. The hemochromatosis gene (HFE) produces a protein that interacts with TfR; and we hypothesized that tumor cells would selectively mutate HFE to improve their iron-uptake and thus provide themselves a growth advantage over non-tumor cells. A total of 36 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples and matched tumor-free tissue from the same individuals were examined for HFE mutations using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). Sequencing analysis of the shifted bands in three of 36 cases (in both, the tumor and matching normal tissue of the same individuals) revealed the cysteine to tyrosine substitution at amino acid residue 282 (C282Y) in the protein. Surprisingly, matching samples from one patient with a heterozygous C282Y mutation in the germline, showed loss of heterozygosity in the tumor sample at the mutant HFE allele resulting in loss of the C282Y and retention of the normal allele. In addition, we examined 45 tumor cell lines from 11 different tissues. Five cell lines had a heterozygous mutation of HFE, none had a homozygous HFE mutation in the coding region. In summary, our experiments suggest that HFE mutations are not associated with a growth advantage for cancer cells.	16012706
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical aspects of hemochromatosis.	Transfusion science	2000	0.5	Hemochromatosis is one of the most frequent genetic diseases among the white populations, affecting one in three hundred persons. Its diagnosis has been radically transformed by the discovery of the HFE gene. In a given individual, the diagnosis can, from now on, be ascertained on the sole association of a plasma transferrin saturation (TS) over 45% and homozygosity for the C282Y mutation. Liver biopsy is only required to search for cirrhosis whenever there is hepatomegaly and/or serum ferritin >1000 ng/ml and/or elevated serum AST. Family screening is mandatory, primarily centered on the siblings. The treatment remains based on venesection therapy which improves many features of the disease (one of the most refractory, however, being the joint signs) and permits normal life expectancy provided the diagnosis is established prior to the development of cirrhosis or of insulin-dependent diabetes. In view of the prevalence, the non-invasive diagnosis, the spontaneous severity and the efficacy of a very simple therapy, hemochromatosis should benefit from population screening. This screening could be based, first, on the assessment of transferrin saturation, followed - when elevated - by the search for the C282Y mutation. The discovery of the HFE gene has also paved the road for the individualization of other types of iron overload syndromes which are not HFE-related.	11099895
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hereditary hemochromatosis].	La Revue de medecine interne	2000	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a fairly common disease in the Caucasian population, with a prevalence estimated at between 1.5 to 3/1,000 inhabitants. Over the past few years, its symptomatology has altered; at present, its clinical aspect with diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, and darker skin pigmentation only constitutes 10% of new cases of this disease. In 1996, the discovery of the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene radically altered the diagnostic approach to hereditary hemochromatosis. At present, any patient admitted with an isolated case of asthenia, or with arthralgia or hypertransaminasemia should be examined via transferrin-saturation testing: if the transferrin saturation coefficient is > 45%, then the presence of the C282Y mutation should be investigated to confirm the diagnosis of hemochromatosis. A liver biopsy is no longer necessary to establish the diagnosis, but this is still useful in cases of possible cirrhosis, which is the main risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Phlebotomy remains the sole recommended treatment, and should be undertaken in a case-specific manner. Family screening should be carried out for all first-degree relatives for every new case that is diagnosed. The discovery of the HFE gene has permitted hereditary hemochromatosis to be easily differentiated from other forms of hepatic iron overload including a new syndrome, dysmotabolic hepatosiderosis. Casos of homozygotic C282Y without hepatic iron overload have been described, but the clinical outcome of some of these cases requires further study, and adds to the controversy on whether systematic population screening should be made available.	11109593
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Biochemical expression of heterozygous hereditary hemochromatosis.	European journal of internal medicine	2000	2.59	Background: Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disease caused by an iron overload. Two mutations (C282Y and H63D) on the responsible HFE gene have been described. HH heterozygotes may have a slight iron overload that does not cause clinical disease. Compound heterozygosity may be associated with higher iron stores than C282Y heterozygosity. We studied biochemical iron parameters in HH C282Y and compound heterozygotes without a clinically significant iron overload. Methods: Data on hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, serum ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, and transferrin saturation were obtained from 40 C282 wild type controls (irrespective of H63D genotype), 61 C282Y heterozygotes, and 18 compound (C282Y/H63D) heterozygotes without clinical iron overload disease. Results: Serum ferritin levels were significantly higher in female HH heterozygotes, particularly in compound heterozygotes, than in normal women. In male heterozygotes, no difference in serum ferritin was found. We found higher mean serum iron and transferrin saturation levels in male and female HH heterozygotes than in normal controls, the highest in the group of compound heterozygotes. Conclusions: Mean serum ferritin (only in women), serum iron, and transferrin saturation are highest in compound heterozygotes and lowest in controls. C282Y heterozygotes seem to be an intermediate group between compound heterozygotes and the normal population.	11113655
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The S65C mutation in Spain. Implications for iron overload screening.	Haematologica	2000	6.67	Hereditary hemochromatosis is related to mutations of the HFE gene. The role of the S65C mutation of this gene was evaluated in a Spanish population, consisting of 100 controls and 41 patients who had resulted positive to screening for iron overload. Only one patient was heterozygous for the S65C mutation, so the S65C mutation is infrequent in our area. Nevertheless, it is advisable to search for this mutation in cases with iron overload and heterozygosity for the C282Y or H63D mutations of the HFE gene.	11114141
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis in patients with beta-thalassaemia trait.	British journal of haematology	2000	5.4	Severe iron overload has been reported in patients with the beta-thalassaemia trait. Studies performed before the discovery of the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) have yielded conflicting results: some suggest that iron overload might arise from the interaction of the beta-thalassaemia trait with heterozygosity for haemochromatosis, some with homozygosity for haemochromatosis and others that it was unrelated to haemochromatosis. We have studied the clinical phenotype, iron indices and HFE genotypes of 22 unrelated patients with the beta-thalassaemia trait and haemochromatosis, the inheritance of chromosome 6p and 1q haplotypes in families of non-homozygous C282Y probands and serum measures of iron status in relatives heterozygous for C282Y with or without the beta-thalassaemia trait. We demonstrate that the beta-thalassaemia trait aggravates the clinical picture of C282Y homozygotes, favouring higher rates of iron accumulation and the development of severe iron-related complications. We suggest that the coexistence of the beta-thalassaemia trait might also increase the risk of iron overload in patients with HFE genotypes at a mild risk of haemochromatosis. Our findings do not support the hypothesis that the association of the beta-thalassaemia trait with a single C282Y or H63D allele might lead to iron overload and suggest that other non-HFE-related inherited factors are present in haemochromatosis patients with incomplete HFE genotypes.	11122155
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The C282Y polymorphism of the hereditary hemochromatosis gene is associated with increased sex hormone-binding globulin and normal testosterone levels in men.	Journal of endocrinological investigation	2010	1.99	Hereditary hemochromatosis resulting either from homozygosity for the C282Y polymorphism of the HFE gene, or compound heterozygosity for C282Y and H63D, manifests with liver disease and hypogonadism. However, it is unclear whether men who are heterozygotes for C282Y or H63D exhibit subtle abnormalities of sex hormone status. To evaluate whether heterozygosity for either of the HFE gene polymorphisms C282Y or H63D is associated with circulating testosterone and SHBG in men. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 388 community-dwelling men. Men were genotyped for C282Y and H63D. Sera were analysed for testosterone and SHBG, and insulin resistance was estimated using a homeostatic model (HOMA2-IR). Mean age of men in the cohort was 56.9 yr. Men who were heterozygous for the C282Y polymorphism in the HFE gene had higher SHBG levels than men who did not carry this polymorphism (mean ± SE, 38.2 ± 1.64 vs 32.8 ± 0.71 nmol/l, p=0.006). Total and free testosterone levels did not differ in the two groups. In multivariate analysis adjusting for potential confounders including age, waist circumference, testosterone, and HOMA2-IR, C282Y heterozygosity remained associated with SHBG levels (p<0.001). The C282Y polymorphism is associated with SHBG levels in men who do not manifest iron overload. Further studies are needed to clarify potential mechanisms and determine the clinical relevance of this finding.	20160468
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha promoter variants and iron phenotypes in 785 hemochromatosis and iron overload screening (HEIRS) study participants.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2010	0.5	We sought to determine if TNF promoter variants could explain iron phenotype heterogeneity in adults with previous HFE genotyping. HEIRS Study participants genotyped for C282Y and H63D were designated as high transferrin saturation (TS) and/or serum ferritin (SF) (high TS/SF), low TS/SF, or controls. We grouped 191 C282Y homozygotes as high TS/SF, low TS/SF, or controls, and 594 other participants by race/ethnicity as high TS/SF or controls. Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), we screened the TNF promoter region in each participant. We performed multiple regression analyses in C282Y homozygotes using age, sex, HEIRS Study Field Center, and positivity for TNF -308G-->A and -238G-->A to determine if these attributes predicted ln TS or ln SF. DHPLC analyses were successful in 99.3% of 791 participants and detected 9 different variants; TNF -308G-->A and -238G-->A were the most prevalent. Most subjects positive for variants were heterozygous. The phenotype frequencies of each variant did not differ significantly (p<0.05) across subgroups of C282Y homozygotes, or across white, black, Hispanic, and Asian non-C282Y homozygotes subgrouped as high TS/SF phenotypes and controls. TNF -308G-->A positivity was a significant predictor of initial screening ln TS but not ln SF; TNF -238G-->A predicted neither ln TS nor ln SF. We conclude that TNF promoter variants have little, if any, effect on initial screening SF values in adults with or without C282Y homozygosity. We cannot exclude a possible association of homozygosity for TNF promoter variants on TS and SF values.	20178892
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The diagnosis and management of hereditary haemochromatosis.	The Clinical biochemist. Reviews	2010	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a common genetic disorder of iron metabolism in individuals of Northern European ancestry which leads to inappropriate iron absorption from the intestine and iron overload in susceptible individuals. Iron overload is suggested by elevations in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. The majority of patients with clinically significant iron overload are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, however only a minority of C282Y homozygotes fully express the disease clinically. Those with a high serum ferritin (>1000 microg/L) and additional hepatic insults from cofactors are more likely to develop cirrhosis and its complications. The mainstay of treatment is venesection. Those without cirrhosis who undergo appropriate venesection have a normal life expectancy. Family screening is recommended for all first degree relatives of an individual with the disease.	20179792
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A cross-sectional community study of serum iron measures and cognitive status in older adults.	Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD	2010	0.5	The relationship of iron status with cognition and dementia risk in older people is contentious. We have examined the longitudinal relationship between serum ferritin and cognition in 800 community-dwelling Australians 60 years or older. Iron studies (serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin) were performed in 1994/5 and 2003/4 and clinical and cognitive assessments were conducted in 2003/4 for 800 participants of the Busselton Health Study. All participants completed the Cambridge Cognitive test (CAMCOG). Those with CAMCOG scores <84 underwent expert clinical review for cognitive disorders, including the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. Mean serum iron (18.3 micromol/l) and transferrin saturation (28.5%) in 2003/4 did not differ significantly from 1994/5 whereas mean serum ferritin decreased from 162 microg/l in 1994/5 to 123 microg/l in 2003/4, possibly reflecting aging or dietary changes. No relationships were observed between serum iron or transferrin saturation and presence or absence of dementia (p> 0.05). In participants without dementia (n=749), neither serum ferritin in 1994/5 or 2003/4 nor change in serum ferritin between these times was related to total CAMCOG or executive function scores, with or without adjustment for gender, age, National Adult reading test, or stroke history (all p> 0.05). No relationships were observed between ferritin and cognition for participants with possible or probable dementia (n=51). All participants identified as HFE C282Y homozygous or with serum ferritin >1,000 ng/ml had normal CAMCOG scores. We conclude abnormal body iron stores (low or high) are unlikely to have clinically significant effects on cognition or dementia risk in community-dwelling older people.	20182059
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Molecular diagnosis of HFE mutations in routine laboratories. Results of a survey from reference laboratories in France].	Annales de biologie clinique		0.28	HFE-related hemochromatosis (HFE hemochromatosis) or type 1 hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive iron overload usually expressed in adulthood. The HFE gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.3), encodes a protein that plays a crucial role in iron metabolism by modulating hepcidin synthesis in the liver. Homozygosity for the p.Cys282Tyr mutation accounts for nearly 80% of cases of hemochromatosis in France. Genetic testing is the key investigation to confirm the diagnosis of HFE hemochromatosis. A survey on routine practices was carried out among the eight reference laboratories of the French national network on genetic iron disorders. The main findings from this survey are as follows: 1) the p.Cys282Tyr mutation must be searched for as an initial step to establish the diagnosis of HFE hemochromatosis. This is in agreement with the recommendations of the French Health Authority (HAS) published in 2005. In these recommendations, homozygosity for the p.Cys282Tyr mutation with at least elevated transferrin saturation, is considered the only genotype that confirms of the diagnosis of HFE hemochromatosis; 2) in combination with the p.Cys282Tyr mutation (compound heterozygous genotypes), the p.Ser65Cys and the p.His63Asp variants may contribute to the occurrence of mild iron overload; 3) family screening is mandatory following the detection of homozygous individuals for the p.Cys282Tyr mutation.	22565179
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE H63D mutation frequency shows an increase in Turkish women with breast cancer.	BMC cancer	2006	3.27	The hereditary hemochromatosis gene HFE plays a pivotal role in iron homeostasis. The association between cancer and HFE hetero- or homozygosity has previously been shown including hepatocellular and nonhepatocellular malignancies. This study was performed to compare frequencies of HFE C282Y and H63D variants in Turkish women with breast cancer and healthy controls. Archived DNA samples of Hacettepe University Oncology Institute were used in this study. The HFE gene was investigated by PCR-RFLP. All subjects studied were free from C282Y mutation. Thirty-nine patients had H63D mutation and were all heterozygous. H63D allele frequency was 22.2% (39/176) in the breast cancer patients, and 14% (28/200) in the healthy volunteers. Statistical analysis of cases with HFE H63D phenotype showed significant difference between breast cancer and healthy volunteers (P = 0.02). Our results suggest that HFE H63D mutation frequencies were increased in the breast cancer patients in comparison to those in the general population. Also, odds ratios (odds ratio = 2.05) computed in this study suggest that H63D has a positive association with breast cancer.	16503999
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A study of 82 extended HLA haplotypes in HFE-C282Y homozygous hemochromatosis subjects: relationship to the genetic control of CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers and severity of iron overload.	BMC medical genetics	2006	2.09	It has been recently demonstrated that CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers are genetically transmitted in association with the MHC class I region. The present study was designed with the objective of narrowing the region associated with the setting of CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers in a population of C282Y homozygous hemochromatosis subjects, in whom a high prevalence of abnormally low CD8+ T-lymphocyte counts has been described. The study includes 43 C282Y homozygous subjects fully characterized both phenotypically and genotypically. Clinical characterization includes measurements of iron parameters at diagnosis (transferrin saturation and serum ferritin), total body iron stores and T-cell immunophenotyping determined by flow cytometry. Genetic characterization includes HLA class I alleles (A, B and C) and four additional microsatellite markers (D6S265, D6S2222, D6S105 and D6S2239) spanning 5 Megabases in the 6p21.3 region. Eighty-two extended C282Y carrying haplotypes were defined. Single-locus analysis revealed that the HLA-A region was associated with CD8+ T-cell numbers. Multivariate analysis showed that the combinations of the most common HLA-A alleles (HLA-A*03, -A*02 and -A*01) were associated with significantly lower numbers of CD8+ T-lymphocytes (0.30 +/- 0.14 x 106/ml), in comparison with subjects carrying only one copy of those alleles (0.46 +/- 0.19 x 106/ml) and subjects without any copy of those alleles (0.79 +/- 0.15 x 106/ml;p = 0.0001). No differences were observed in CD8+ T-cell counts among control subjects carrying the same combinations of HLA-A alleles (0.47 +/- 0.14; 0.45 +/- 0.21 and 0.41 +/- 0.17 x 106/ml, respectively), therefore not supporting a direct effect of HLA specificity but rather an indirect association with a locus close to HLA-A. Multivariate analysis showed that the combination of the most common HLA-A alleles also have an impact on the clinical expression of HH in terms of iron stores, in males(p = 0.0009). The present study provides evidence supporting an inextricable link between extended HLA haplotypes, CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers and severity of iron overload in hereditary hemochromatosis(HH). It gives additional information to better define a candidate region involved in the regulation of CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers. A new evolutionary hypothesis concerning the inheritance of the phenotype of low CD8+ T-lymphocyte numbers associated with particular ancestral HLA haplotypes carrying the C282Y mutation and its implication on the clinical heterogeneity of HH is discussed.	16509978
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genotyping the HFE gene by melting point analysis with the LightCycler system: Pros and cons.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	The assay that combines rapid-cycle PCR with allele-specific fluorescent probe melting profiles performed on the Roche Diagnostics LightCycler is commonly employed for genotyping the HFE gene. We report three illustrative cases of the pros and cons of this method. In two cases, atypical melting curves allows the identification of new DNA substitutions in the HFE gene, whereas, in the third case, a typical melting curve of c.845G>A mutation (C282Y) homozygosity overlooks a nucleotide change and promotes misdiagnosis of HH.	16515868
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) in a cohort of 1,000 neonates in Madrid (Spain).	Annals of hematology	2006	3.02	For centuries in Europe, population movements have contributed to ethnic groups, cultures, and consequently, inheritance mixing. There are certain genetic diseases such as hereditary hemochromatosis whose distribution is directly related to the population movements. The objective of the present investigation was to determine the C282Y and H63D mutation frequency of the HFE gene in a cohort study of 1,000 neonates in the Community of Madrid (Spain), thus contributing to the HFE gene mutations distribution research in Europe and establishing the origin of the mutations in Spain. The allelic frequency of C282Y mutation was 1.7% (CI 95% 1.1-2.3) and the H63D allele was present in 16.4% of chromosomes (CI 95% 14.8-18). In Spain, the presence of C282Y mutation and its distribution could be due more to Celtic than to Viking legacy, whereas it is assumed that the one in relation to the H63D variant occurred in the Basque Country during the Paleolithic Period.	16520984
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.	Gastroenterology	2010	18.19	In the late 1800s, hemochromatosis was considered an odd autoptic finding. More than a century later, it was finally recognized as a hereditary, multi-organ disorder associated with a polymorphism that is common among white people: a 845G-->A change in HFE that results in C282Y in the gene product. Hemochromatosis is now a well-defined syndrome characterized by normal iron-driven erythropoiesis and the toxic accumulation of iron in parenchymal cells of liver, heart, and endocrine glands. It can be caused by mutations that affect any of the proteins that limit the entry of iron into the blood. In mice, deletion of the iron hormone hepcidin and any of 8 genes that regulate its biology, including Hfe, transferrin receptor 2 (Tfr2), and hemojuvelin (Hjv) (which all sense the accumulation of iron that hepcidin corrects) or ferroportin (Fpn) (the cellular iron exporter down-regulated by hepcidin), cause iron overload but not organ disease. In humans, loss of TfR2, HJV, and hepcidin itself or FPN mutations result in full-blown hemochromatosis. Unlike these rare instances, in white people, homozygotes for C282Y polymorphism in HFE are numerous, but they are only predisposed to hemochromatosis; complete organ disease develops in a minority, when these individuals abuse alcohol or from other unidentified modifying factors. HFE gene testing can be used to diagnose hemochromatosis, but analyses of liver histology and clinical features are still required to identify patients with rare, non-HFE forms of the disease. The role of hepcidin in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis reveals its similarities to endocrine diseases such as diabetes and indicates new approaches to diagnosis and management of this common disorder in iron metabolism.	20542038
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The H63D genetic variant of the HFE gene is independently associated with the virological response to interferon and ribavirin therapy in chronic hepatitis C.	European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	2010	2.09	Conflicting results have been reported in studies evaluating the relationship between serum markers of iron overload, liver iron deposits, and HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) in chronic hepatitis C patients, and also their impact on the response to therapy in these patients. To evaluate the role of HFE mutations in the severity of liver disease and in the response to therapy in chronic hepatitis C. Two hundred and sixty-four hepatitis C patients treated with standard interferon and ribavirin were divided into two groups according to type of antiviral response: sustained virological response (SVR) and nonresponse or relapse. We evaluated the relationship between HFE mutation and the type of antiviral response, clinical data, biochemical tests, liver histopathology, virological data, and HFE mutations. Of the 264 patients, 88 (32.1%) had SVR whereas 67.9% had nonresponse or relapse. Liver iron deposits were observed in 49.2% of the patients. The factors associated with SVR were hepatitis C virus genotype 2 or 3, transferrin saturation value of 45% or less, and detection of the H63D mutation. HFE mutation was more frequent in patients with iron deposits, but without association with serum iron biochemistry or severity of liver disease. Steatosis was more frequent in patients with liver iron deposits. CONCLUSION THE: H63D mutation was an independent factor associated with SVR in chronic hepatitis C patients, as also were hepatitis C virus genotype 2 or 3 and transferrin saturation value of 45% or less. Moreover, the H63D mutation was associated with liver iron deposits.	20555268
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Ferritin concentrations in synovial fluid are higher in osteoarthritis patients with HFE gene mutations (C282Y or H63D).	Scandinavian journal of rheumatology	2010	2.31	In view of the clinical similarities between polyarticular osteoarthritis (POA) with metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint involvement and the arthropathy that occurs in hereditary haemochromatosis (HH), it was hypothesized that osteochondral damage in both disorders may be due to localized iron overload. Accordingly, it was predicted that the concentration of ferritin in synovial fluid (SF) would be higher in OA patients with HFE gene mutations than in HFE wild-type (wt) OA patients. The aim of this study was to test this proposition. Sequential patients with physician-diagnosed OA and, for comparison, diverse inflammatory diseases of the joints, who required diagnostic or therapeutic arthrocentesis, were studied. Participants underwent HFE genotyping. SF samples were assayed for ferritin and also for selected cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Seventy-three patients with diverse rheumatic disorders were recruited. Of the 29 patients who had knee OA, 15 were wt and 14 were heterozygous for HFE mutations (C282Y or H63D). Mean SF ferritin concentrations in the wt and heterozygous OA groups were 273 and 655 ng/mL, respectively (p = 0.0146). A predicted difference in SF ferritin concentrations in patients with knee OA was confirmed. Concentrations of ferritin in the SF were found to be two- to threefold higher in knee OA patients with HFE gene mutations compared to wt patients. This finding is consistent with the possibility that, in OA patients with HFE gene mutations, localized iron overload may contribute either directly or indirectly to osteochondral damage, possibly in a similar way to that which occurs in the arthropathy that complicates HH.	20560808
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotype and iron metabolism in Chinese patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and aplastic anemia.	Annals of hematology	2010	3.02	The incidence of HFE gene mutations in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases remains controversial. In this study, we examined the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations in 271 Chinese patients with MDS, 402 with aplastic anemia (AA) and 1,615 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in combination with DNA sequencing. No C282Y mutations were observed in the entire cohort. The distribution of H63D heterozygous and homozygous genotypes was not significantly different between the AA cases and the controls (9.7% versus 10.2%, 0.25% versus 0.24%, respectively). While the H63D heterozygous genotype in MDS patients was significantly lower than that in the controls (4.1% versus 10.2%, p = 0.002), the H63D homozygous genotype was not detected in the MDS patients. The results suggest that HFE gene mutations are not common genetic factors in Chinese patients with MDS and AA. We also compared iron metabolic parameters, including serum ferritin, serum iron, and transferrin saturation values, between HFE mutant and HFE wild-type groups in the absence of transfusion iron overload, but no significant difference was found in either MDS or AA patients except that the level of serum iron in AA patients was significantly higher in mutant carriers than in those with wild-type HFE (p = 0.011). Similarly, there was no significant difference between HFE mutant and HFE wild-type MDS and AA patients in clinical indices such as alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, fasting blood sugar values, and electrocardiogram. The results suggest that H63D mutations may not have clinical significance in Chinese patients with MDS and AA.	20563578
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Vascular presentation of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency in adulthood.	Journal of inherited metabolic disease	2011	3.54	Several recent studies describing a solely vascular presentation of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency in adulthood prompted us to analyze the frequency of patients manifesting with vascular complications in the Czech Republic. Between 1980 and 2009, a total of 20 Czech patients with CBS deficiency have been diagnosed yielding an incidence of 1:311,000. These patients were divided into three groups based on symptoms leading to diagnosis: those with vascular complications, with connective tissue manifestation and with neurological presentation. A vascular event such as a clinical feature leading to diagnosis of homocystinuria was present in five patients, while two of them had no other symptoms typical for CBS deficiency at the time of diagnosis. All patients with the vascular manifestation were diagnosed only during the past decade. The median age of diagnosis was 29 years in the vascular, 11.5 years in the connective tissue and 4.5 years in the neurological group. The ratio of pyridoxine responsive to nonresponsive patients was higher in the vascular (4 of 5 patients) and connective tissue groups (6 of 7 patients) than in the neurological group (2 of 8 patients). Mutation c.833T>C (p.I278T) was frequent in patients with vascular (6/10 alleles) and connective tissue presentation (8/14 alleles), while it was not present in patients with neurological involvement (0/16 alleles). During the last decade, we have observed patients with homocystinuria diagnosed solely due to vascular events; this milder form of homocystinuria usually manifests at greater ages, has a high ratio of pyridoxine responsiveness/nonresponsiveness, and the mutation c.833T>C (p.I278T) is often present.	20567906
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hypofibrinogenemia and liver disease: a new case of Aguadilla fibrinogen and review of the literature.	Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia	2015	2.67	Fibrinogen storage disease (FSD) is characterized by hypofibrinogenemia and hepatic inclusions due to impaired release of mutant fibrinogen which accumulates and aggregates in the hepatocellular endoplasmic reticulum. Liver disease is variable. We studied a new Swiss family with fibrinogen Aguadilla. In order to understand the molecular peculiarity of FSD mutations, fibrinogen Aguadilla and the three other causative mutations, all located in the γD domain, were modelled. The proband is a Swiss girl aged 4 investigated because of fatigue and elevated liver enzymes. Protein structure models were prepared using the Swiss-PdbViewer and POV-Ray software. The proband was found to be heterozygous for fibrinogen Aguadilla: FGG Arg375Trp. Familial screening revealed that her mother and maternal grandmother were also affected and, in addition, respectively heterozygous and homozygous for the hereditary haemochromatosis mutation HFE C282Y. Models of backbone and side-chain interactions for fibrinogen Aguadilla in a 10-angstrom region revealed the loss of five H-bonds and the gain of one H-bond between structurally important amino acids. The structure predicted for fibrinogen Angers showed a novel helical structure in place of hole 'a' on the outer edge of γD likely to have a negative impact on fibrinogen assembly and secretion. The mechanism by which FSD mutations generate hepatic intracellular inclusions is still not clearly established although the promotion of aberrant intermolecular strand insertions is emerging as a likely cause. Reporting new cases is essential in the light of novel opportunities of treatment offered by increasing knowledge of the degradation pathway and autophagy.	25990487
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between sex, systemic iron variation and probability of Parkinson's disease.	The International journal of neuroscience	2016	0.5	Iron homeostasis appears altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent genetic studies and meta-analyses have produced heterogeneous and inconclusive results. In order to verify the possible role of iron status in PD, we have screened some of the main metal gene variants, evaluated their effects on iron systemic status, and checked for possible interactions with PD. In 92 PD patients and 112 healthy controls, we screened the D544E and R793H variants of the ceruloplasmin gene (CP), the P589S variant of the transferrin gene (TF), and the H63D and C282Y variants of the HFE gene, encoding for homologous proteins, respectively. Furthermore, we analyzed serum concentrations of iron, copper and their related proteins. The genetic investigation revealed no significant differences in allelic and genotype distributions between patients and controls. Two different multivariable forward stepwise logistic models showed that, when the effect of sex is considered, an increase of the probability of having PD is associated with low iron concentration and Tf-saturation. This study provides new evidence of the involvement of iron metabolism in PD pathogenesis and reveals a biological effect of sex.	26000822
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The effect of HFE genotypes on measurements of iron overload in patients attending a health appraisal clinic.	Annals of internal medicine	2000	16.44	The gene that causes most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis is designated HFE. Three mutations exist at this locus at a relatively high gene frequency. To determine the gene frequency of the three HFE mutations and to relate genotypes to various clinical and laboratory variables. Observational study. Health appraisal clinic. 10,198 adults who registered for health appraisal and consented to DNA examination for hemochromatosis. Consenting patients were slightly older and had attained a slightly higher educational level than nonconsenting patients. Extensive medical history and laboratory tests, including complete blood count, transferrin saturation, and other chemistries; serum ferritin levels; and HFE genotype. In white participants, the gene frequencies were 0.063 for the C282Y mutation, 0.152 for the H63D mutation, and 0.016 for the S65C mutation. Gene frequencies were lower in other ethnic groups. In participants with HFE mutations, the average serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels were slightly increased, as were mean hemoglobin levels and mean corpuscular volume. A transferrin saturation of 50% had a sensitivity of only 0.52 (95% CI, 0.345 to 0.686) and a specificity of 0.908 (CI, 0.902 to 0.914) for detection of homozygosity. A ferritin level of 200 microg/L in women and 250 microg/L in men had a sensitivity of 0.70 (CI, 0.540 to 0.854) and a specificity of 0.803 (CI, 0.796 to 0.811). The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was lower in women who carried HFE mutations. Screening for transferrin saturation and ferritin levels does not detect all homozygotes for the major hemochromatosis mutation. Heterozygotes for HFE mutations had a lower prevalence of iron deficiency anemia.	10979877
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Role of genetic testing and liver biopsy in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis.	Current gastroenterology reports		0.5	Hemochromatosis is the most common genetic disease affecting people of northern European ancestry. However, the disease is overdiagnosed in patients who do not have the disease and underdiagnosed in those with the disease. Although liver biopsy has been the standard diagnostic test for hemochromatosis, a new genetic blood test for a missense mutation (C282Y) of the HFE gene on chromosome 6 now provides a powerful noninvasive method of diagnosis. The clinical implications of this new genetic blood test compared with conventional liver biopsy in the diagnosis of hemochromatosis are discussed in this article.	10980923
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Role of HFE gene mutations in liver diseases other than hereditary hemochromatosis.	Current gastroenterology reports		0.5	Heavy iron overload, as occurs in primary and secondary hemochromatosis, may cause fibrosis of parenchymal organs, including the heart, liver, and pancreas, and it is a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent evidence indicates that lesser degrees of hepatic iron deposition are also risk factors for nonhemochromatotic liver disease. For example, several recent studies showed extraordinarily high prevalences (about 60% to 75%) of HFE mutations in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda and significantly increased prevalences of these mutations in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis from Australia and the United States. It is less well established that the prevalence of the HFE mutations is increased in alcoholic liver disease and in chronic viral hepatitis, but in both conditions, patients harboring one of these mutations, especially C282Y, are more likely to have advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Thus, these mutations both incite and exacerbate nonhemochromatotic liver disease. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of these associations and emphasize important unresolved questions that require further study.	10980924
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutation (C282Y) and phenotypic expression among a hospitalised population in a high prevalence area of haemochromatosis.	Gut	2000	14.92	"""Previous studies have shown that up to 0.5% of the Caucasian population is homozygous for the HFE gene C282Y mutation. High prevalence values have been reported in Northern Europe. To what extent the presence of this mutation is associated with overt clinical haemochromatosis is unclear. To determine the prevalence of the C282Y allele in a hospitalised population of an acute medical department, and study the phenotypic expression in the homozygotes. Blood samples were obtained from 2027 hospitalised patients; 1900 Caucasians and 127 non-Caucasians. Serum iron, transferrin, and ferritin were measured at admission. The presence of the HFE gene mutation was determined by polymerase chain reaction based analysis. Follow up fasting blood samples were obtained from patients homozygous for the mutation. Fourteen of the 1900 Caucasian subjects (0.74%) were homozygous and 224 (11.8%) were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, including 32 subjects (1.7%) who were compound heterozygous for the C282Y and H63D mutations. Ten of 14 (71%) homozygous patients displayed mild to moderate biochemical expression of haemochromatosis with a serum ferritin level <550 microg/l, two (14%) patients were """"non expressing"""", and two of five in whom liver biopsies were carried out had cirrhosis, including one with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of C282Y homozygosity in a hospitalised population was 0.74%. However, the majority of homozygous patients displayed mild to moderate biochemical expression. C282Y mutation screening may detect individuals that do not develop haemochromatosis. Transferrin saturation and ferritin, which are used as first line screening in haemochromatosis, may be highly unreliable in the presence of an inflammatory process."""	10986220
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Genetic hemochromatosis and the HFE gene].	Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine	2000	0.5	The discovery of the HFE gene has lead to considerable improvement in the understanding and the management of genetic hemochromatosis. More than 90% of well-defined patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation, and genetic testing has become an important diagnostic tool. The significance of the other mutations in the HFE gene remain controversial: only C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes could present with a phenotype compatible with hemochromatosis, but with a mild expression and a low penetrance. The link between iron overload and HFE mutation is explained by the interaction between HFE protein, beta-2-microglobulin and transferrin receptor, which is abolished by the C282Y mutation, but is not yet fully understood.	10989541
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Iron overload and cancer].	Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine	2000	0.5	Most experimental and human data support the hypothesis that iron overload is a risk factor for cancer in general and liver cancer in particular. This oncogenic effect could be explained by an overproduction of reactive oxygen species and free radicals. In cirrhosis due to genetic haemochromatosis (homozygosity for the mutation C282Y in the HFE gene) there is an increase incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Few cases have been reported in genetic haemochromatosis with iron overload but without cirrhosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma developed in non cirrhotic liver there is a mild iron overload in more than 50% of cases. In these patients heterozygous and compound C282Y mutations are found in 36%. In black Africans, iron overload genetically determined but not linked to mutations in the HFE gene increases also the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Among the many factors (viral hepatitis, alcohol, tobacco etc.) which play a role in hepatic carcinogenesis, iron overload is probably an important one and therefore should be treated.	10989544
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Iron overload and public health].	Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine	2000	0.5	Genetic hemochromatosis, due to its frequency (about 300,000 cases in France) and to its severity, must be considered as a public health burden. Its curability--insofar as its diagnosis has been made early--and the disposal of non invasive and reliable phenotypic (transferrin saturation) and genotypic (HFE C282Y mutation) tests make its diagnosis easy. Thus, diagnosis faced with early clinical and biological symptoms must be promulgated as screening in probant families. General screening is still hampered by ethical and socio-economic obstacles, but should be evaluated in large prospective studies. Otherwise, the recently described insulin resistance-associated liver iron overload syndrome might account for epidemiological associations that have been reported between increased body iron stores and cancerous, cardio-vascular and hepatic disorders. This might extend markedly the impact of iron overload in public health and lead to broaden screening and prevention to all iron overload conditions.	10989545
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	The Journal of rheumatology	2000	0.5	To investigate the role of C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE gene in susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The distribution of C282Y and H63D mutations in patients with RA and in healthy subjects was examined by restriction endonuclease digestion of polymerase chain reaction amplified genomic DNA. The prevalence of C282Y mutation in patients with RA was the same as in healthy controls. In contrast, the distribution of H63D mutation was significantly higher in the total RA patient population and in DRB1 QKRAA/QRRAA epitope positive patients compared to respective groups of controls. Analysis of data showed that (1) both H63D mutation and QKRAA/QRRAA DRB1 epitope are individually associated with RA susceptibility; (2) there is interaction between these 2 factors in development of RA; and (3) both these factors combined have stronger association with RA susceptibility than with these factors individually. H63D mutation appears to play a role in pathogenesis of RA. This study is small and must be regarded as preliminary. These data therefore need confirmation from independent studies.	10990216
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: HFE mutation analysis in Greeks reveals genetic heterogeneity.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2000	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is common among Caucasians; reported disease frequencies vary from 0.3 to 0.8%. Identification of a candidate HFE gene in 1996 was soon followed by the description of two ancestral mutations, i.e., c.845G-->A (C282Y) and c.187C-->G (H63D). To these was recently added the mutation S65C, which may represent a simple polymorphism. The incidence of HH in Greece is unknown but clinical cases are rare. Also unknown is the carrier frequency of the two mutant alleles. A first estimate of the latter is given in the present report. It is based on data from the genetic analysis of 10 unrelated patients of Greek origin who were referred to our center for genotyping and 158 unselected male blood donors. The allele frequencies for the C282Y and H63D mutations were 0.003 and 0.145, respectively. The C282Y allele was detected in 50% of HH patients. This is considerably lower than the frequencies reported for HH patients in the U.S.A. (82%) and France (91 %) and closer to that reported in Italy (64%). Five patients did not carry any known HFE mutation; three may represent cases of juvenile hemochromatosis, given their early onset with iron overload, hypogonadism, and heart disease. We suggest that genetic heterogeneity is more prominent in Southern Europe. It is also possible that the penetrance of the responsible genes is different across the Mediterranean.	11001626
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Nonexpressing homozygotes for C282Y hemochromatosis: minority or majority of cases?	Molecular genetics and metabolism		3.09	Genetic testing for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene has been a major advance in the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. In most studies, more than 90% of typical hemochromatosis patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Large-scale population screening studies in predominantly Caucasian populations have demonstrated a high prevalence of C282Y homozygotes of approximately 1 in 300. Despite this high prevalence by genetic testing, the clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis and mortality from the disease are much less common. One possibility is the presence of many undiagnosed cases with nonspecific symptoms, and deaths occurring that are attributed to liver disease, diabetes, and heart disease without the recognition of iron overload secondary to hemochromatosis. Another possibility is a high prevalence of nonexpressing homozygotes. In this review, the available data on nonexpressing C282Y homozygotes is collected including information on pathogenesis, environmental interactions, and implications for population screening using genetic testing.	11001800
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: mutations in genes involved in iron homeostasis in Brazilian patients.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2011	0.5	p.C282Y mutation and rare variants in the HFE gene have been associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). HH is also caused by mutations in other genes, such as the hemojuvelin (HJV), hepcidin (HAMP), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and ferroportin (SLC40A1). The low rate homozygous p.C282Y mutation in Brazil is suggestive that mutations in non-HFE genes may be linked to HH phenotype. To screen exon-by-exon DNA sequences of HFE, HJV, HAMP, TFR2 and SLC40A1 genes to characterize the molecular basis of HH in a sample of the Brazilian population. Fifty-one patients with primary iron overload (transferrin saturation ≥50% in females and ≥60% in males) were selected. Subsequent bidirectional DNA sequencing of HFE, HJV, HAMP, TFR2 and SLC40A1 exons was performed. Thirty-seven (72.5%) out of the 51 patients presented at least one HFE mutation. The most frequent genotype associated with HH was the homozygous p.C282Y mutation (n=11, 21.6%). In addition, heterozygous HFE p.S65C mutation was found in combination with p.H63D in two patients and homozygous HFE p.H63D was found in two patients as well. Sequencing in the HJV and HAMP genes revealed HJV p.E302K, HJV p.A310G, HJV p.G320V and HAMP p.R59G alterations. Molecular and clinical diagnosis of juvenile hemochromatosis (homozygous form for the HJV p.G320V) was described for the first time in Brazil. Three TFR2 polymorphisms (p.A75V, p.A617A and p.R752H) and six SLC40A1 polymorphisms (rs13008848, rs11568351, rs11568345, rs11568344, rs2304704, rs11568346) and the novel mutation SLC40A1 p.G204S were also found. The HFE p.C282Y in homozygosity or in heterozygosity with p.H63D was the most frequent mutation associated with HH in this sample. The HJV p.E302K and HAMP p.R59G variants, and the novel SLC40A1 p.G204S mutation may also be linked to primary iron overload but their role in the pathophysiology of HH remain to be elucidated.	21411349
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	SNP and haplotype analysis reveals new HFE variants associated with iron overload trait.	Human mutation	2011	5.09	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common-recessive-autosomal disease characterized by progressive iron overload, and its prevalence correlates with c.845G>A (p. C282Y) mutation of the HFE gene. Two other variants c.187C>G and c.193A>T are associated with a mild iron overload phenotype. The correlation studies have revealed incompletely penetrance of the HFE mutations, as well as the lack of mutation on some chromosomes from patients. We screened for SNPs before examining allele and haplotype association with elevated iron parameters. We confirmed that the c.845G>A mutation is in complete linkage disequilibrium with a unique haplotype, whereas two haplotypes proved to account for 79.8 and 20.2% of the c.187G chromosomes whose only difference was the g.4694C>G variation. A greater prevalence of the g.4694G allele among patients' chromosomes, compared to controls, was observed. In addition, among non-mutant chromosomes the analyses revealed a risk haplotype and a protective haplotype, and the g.4694G and the c.1007-47A alleles were associated with a higher risk of elevated iron parameters. We determined that the g.4694C allele was located within a putative hypoxia-response element, protein binding was evidenced and was reduced with the g.4694C>G change. In addition, IVS4 was not spliced as well in the c.1007-47A allele compared to the c.1007-47G allele.	21412944
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis in some men from the Eastern part of Turkey and the effects of H63D mutations on iron studies.	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	2012	3.02	Abstract Background: Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is characterized by an increased intestinal absorption of iron due to mutations in iron-related genes. The C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene are principally responsible for HFE-related hemochromatosis. The majority of HH cases are reported in Western countries where HFE-related mutations are common. The prevalence of HFE-related mutations is not yet clear in eastern Turkey. We aim to clarify the frequency of HFE gene mutations in men who live in eastern Turkey and also assess the biochemical effects of the H63D mutation. Methods: Using the reverse hybridization Hemochromatosis Strip Assay A (ViennaLab, Profiblot T-48, Tecan), DNA extracted from the blood samples of 159 healthy men was analyzed for different mutations in the HFE gene. Results: The H63D mutation was found with an overall carrier frequency of 5.6% (7% heterozygous and 2% homozygous). We also noted that the C282Y gene mutation was not detected in the study. In subjects with the H63D mutation, there were significantly elevated levels both of serum iron and transferrin saturation (p<0.05). Other hematologic and biochemical tests were in the normal ranges in H63D-positive subjects. Conclusions: A lack of C282Y mutations has been reported as a basic finding for non-Western countries and Turkey. H63D mutations in the HFE gene may cause higher levels of serum iron and transferrin saturation. Both may be useful as simple screening tools for HH.	22718642
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing-3 gene I148M polymorphism, steatosis, and liver damage in hereditary hemochromatosis.	World journal of gastroenterology	2012	2.79	To investigate whether the patatin-like phospholipase domain containing-3 gene (PNPLA3) I148M polymorphism is associated with steatosis, fibrosis stage, and cirrhosis in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). We studied 174 consecutive unrelated homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation of HH (C282Y+/+ HH) patients from Northern Italy, for whom the presence of cirrhosis could be determined based on histological or clinical criteria, without excessive alcohol intake (< 30/20 g/d in males or females) or hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus viral hepatitis. Steatosis was evaluated in 123 patients by histology (n = 100) or ultrasound (n = 23). The PNPLA3 rs738409 single nucleotide polymorphism, encoding for the p.148M protein variant, was genotyped by a Taqman assay (assay on demand, Applied Biosystems). The association of the PNPLA3 I148M protein variant (p.I148M) with steatosis, fibrosis stage, and cirrhosis was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. PNPLA3 genotype was not associated with metabolic parameters, including body mass index (BMI), the presence of diabetes, and lipid levels, but the presence of the p.148M variant at risk was independently associated with steatosis [odds ratio (OR) 1.84 per p.148M allele, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-3.31; P = 0.037], independently of BMI and alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) levels. The p.148M variant was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase (P = 0.0014) and ALT levels (P = 0.017) at diagnosis, independently of BMI and the severity of iron overload. In patients with liver biopsy, the 148M variant was independently associated with the severity (stage) of fibrosis (estimated coefficient 0.56 ± 0.27, P = 0.041). In the overall series of patients, the p.148M variant was associated with cirrhosis in lean (P = 0.049), but not in overweight patients (P = not significant). At logistic regression analysis, cirrhosis was associated with BMI ≥ 25 (OR 1.82, 95% CI: 1.02-3.55), ferritin > 1000 ng/mL at diagnosis (OR 19.3, 95% CI: 5.3-125), and with the G allele in patients with BMI < 25 (OR 3.26, 95% CI: 1.3-10.3). The PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism may represent a permissive factor for fibrosis progression in patients with C282Y+/+ HH.	22719190
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations frequency in the Transylvania region, Romania.	Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD	2012	1.89	HFE-associated haemochromatosis is one of the most frequent autosomal recessive disorders in the Caucasian population. Although most of the cases are homozygous individuals for the C282Y mutation, another two mutations, H63D and S65C, have been reported to be associated with milder forms of the disease. This study was a first attempt to evaluate the distribution of these HFE gene mutations in the Transylvania region. Two-hundred and twenty-five healthy, unrelated volunteers originating from the Transylvania region, Romania, were screened for the HFE gene C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations, using molecular genetics assays (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragments Length Polymorphism). For the C282Y mutation, 7 heterozygotes (3.1%) were found, but no homozygous individual. In the case of the H63D mutation, 40 heterozygotes (17.8%) and 4 homozygotes (1.75%) for the mutant allele were evidenced. We found a compound heterozygous genotype (C282Y/H63D) in one individual (0.45%). Thus, the allele frequencies of the C282Y and H63D were 1.75% and 10.9%, respectively. Three individuals (1.3%) were found to harbour the S65C mutation in a heterozygous state, but none in a homozygous state: the allele frequency of the mutant allele was 0.75%. The distribution of the HFE gene C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations found in our group matches the tendencies observed in other European countries: a decreasing gradient from Northern to Southern Europe for the C282Y mutation; high frequency for the H63D mutation, and low frequency for the S65C mutation in most of the countries.	22720307
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical expression of C282Y homozygous HFE haemochromatosis at 14 years of age.	Annals of clinical biochemistry	2006	2.12	A 14-year-old boy who presented with debilitating lethargy was shown to have an elevated serum ferritin of 572 microg/L and a C282Y homozygous HFE genotype. Liver iron concentration was measured non-invasively by magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed a liver iron concentration of 59 micromol/g dry weight (children's reference range < 14). The early phenotypic expression was further investigated by screening genomic DNA for the presence of co-inherited mutations in genes responsible for non-HFE haemochromatosis. Coding regions and splice sites in genes encoding hepcidin and haemojuvelin were sequenced and previously described mutations in ferroportin 1 and transferrin receptor 2 genes were screened. Although no mutations were found, the most likely cause for the early expression is the presence of novel mutations or gene(s).	16704763
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Development of porphyria cutanea tarda in a chronic hepatitis C patient with indetectable viremia under treatment with peg-interferon plus ribavirin].	Acta gastroenterologica Latinoamericana	2006	0.5	Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is considered an extra-hepatic manifestation of HCV infection. The frequency of this association varies according to different authors and the mechanism by which the virus can trigger this disease is not yet clear. We present a 47-year-old-man with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b who, during the treatment with peg-interferón alfa 2b plus ribavirina, with no detectable viremia at weeks 12th, 24th, and 48th, developed dermatological photosensitive lesions at week 44th. With a presumptive diagnosis of PCT a cutaneous/skin biopsy was performed as well as a porphyrin dosage with urine porphyirins of 4185 microg/24 hs (nv<250). The chromatographic analysis revealed the typical PCT pattern thus confirming the diagnosis. The hemochromatosis HFE gen evaluation showed heterozigotus character mutations (H63D and C282Y) a frequent association in patients with iron overload and PCT. The antiviral treatment of the HCV infection can improve the clinical-humoral manifestations of PCT. The novo occurrence of PCT was recently reported during chronic hepatitis C treatment with interferón and ribavirin, but no cases of late appearance of PCT in patients with no detectable viremia were reported. The mutation of the gen HFE in our patient and the hemolysis caused by ribavirin can be related to the development of the disease, but the iron overload because of ribavirin use is also controversial. This is another example of the complexity of this association.	16706076
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Metals and the liver.	Current opinion in gastroenterology	2012	3.62	Hereditary liver diseases resulting in copper and iron overload may cause significant morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed and treated early. The goal of this review is to highlight the key publications on genetics, diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis and Wilson disease over the past 18 months. Several recent advancements have been made in the genetic diagnosis of hemochromatosis and Wilson disease. Uncommon HFE mutations resulting in phenotypic hemochromatosis among C282Y heterozygotes have been identified from HFE gene sequencing. A serum ferritin less than 1000 μg/l in C282Y homozygotes was found to be associated with milder symptoms of hemochromatosis. Deferasirox was shown to reduce iron overload in patients with hemochromatosis and may be an option for patients who cannot tolerate phlebotomy. There was found to be evidence of genotype and phenotype correlation in Wilson disease, which can be diagnosed by genetic sequencing. A modified diagnostic guideline has been developed for children with Wilson disease with mild liver disease that increases the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. Also treatment with copper chelating agents has less hepatic treatment failures when compared with zinc monotherapy. Advancements in diagnosis of hemochromatosis and Wilson disease may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment with resulting decrease in morbidity and mortality.	22395570
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Molecular diagnostic and pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis.	International journal of molecular sciences	2012	3.26	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by enhanced intestinal absorption of dietary iron. Without therapeutic intervention, iron overload leads to multiple organ damage such as liver cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, arthritis, hypogonadism and skin pigmentation. Most HH patients carry HFE mutant genotypes: homozygosity for p.Cys282Tyr or p.Cys282Tyr/p.His63Asp compound heterozygosity. In addition to HFE gene, mutations in the genes that encode hemojuvelin (HJV), hepcidin (HAMP), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and ferroportin (SLC40A1) have been associated with regulation of iron homeostasis and development of HH. The aim of this review was to identify the main gene mutations involved in the pathogenesis of type 1, 2, 3 and 4 HH and their genetic testing indication. HFE testing for the two main mutations (p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp) should be performed in all patients with primary iron overload and unexplained increased transferrin saturation and/or serum ferritin values. The evaluation of the HJV p.Gly320Val mutation must be the molecular test of choice in suspected patients with juvenile hemochromatosis with less than 30 years and cardiac or endocrine manifestations. In conclusion, HH is an example that genetic testing can, in addition to performing the differential diagnostic with secondary iron overload, lead to more adequate and faster treatment.	22408404
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Non-coding keratin variants associate with liver fibrosis progression in patients with hemochromatosis.	PloS one	2012	3.06	Keratins 8 and 18 (K8/K18) are intermediate filament proteins that protect the liver from various forms of injury. Exonic K8/K18 variants associate with adverse outcome in acute liver failure and with liver fibrosis progression in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection or primary biliary cirrhosis. Given the association of K8/K18 variants with end-stage liver disease and progression in several chronic liver disorders, we studied the importance of keratin variants in patients with hemochromatosis. The entire K8/K18 exonic regions were analyzed in 162 hemochromatosis patients carrying homozygous C282Y HFE (hemochromatosis gene) mutations. 234 liver-healthy subjects were used as controls. Exonic regions were PCR-amplified and analyzed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and DNA sequencing. Previously-generated transgenic mice overexpressing K8 G62C were studied for their susceptibility to iron overload. Susceptibility to iron toxicity of primary hepatocytes that express K8 wild-type and G62C was also assessed. We identified amino-acid-altering keratin heterozygous variants in 10 of 162 hemochromatosis patients (6.2%) and non-coding heterozygous variants in 6 additional patients (3.7%). Two novel K8 variants (Q169E/R275W) were found. K8 R341H was the most common amino-acid altering variant (4 patients), and exclusively associated with an intronic KRT8 IVS7+10delC deletion. Intronic, but not amino-acid-altering variants associated with the development of liver fibrosis. In mice, or ex vivo, the K8 G62C variant did not affect iron-accumulation in response to iron-rich diet or the extent of iron-induced hepatocellular injury. In patients with hemochromatosis, intronic but not exonic K8/K18 variants associate with liver fibrosis development.	22412904
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic haemochromatosis: genes and mutations associated with iron loading.	Best practice & research. Clinical haematology	2002	0.5	Haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder common among Caucasians that leads to iron overload. Molecular studies have shown that the disease is prevalently due to a mutation in the HFE gene. Although C282Y in the homozygous state remains the most common patient's genotype, other genes and genetic mutations are associated with haemochromatosis. Haemochromatosis type 2, a severe form with juvenile onset, is due to mutations in an unidentified gene on chromosome 1q. Haemochromatosis type 3 is linked to a locus on 7q22 and is due to mutations in the transferrin receptor 2. Haemochromatosis type 4, the only autosomal dominant form, is caused by mutations in ferroportin 1 on 2q32. The genes responsible for African and neonatal forms of iron overload are still unknown. The identification of all of the genes associated with haemochromatosis is critical for molecular-based diagnosis and central to our understanding of the regulation of iron homeostasis.	12401307
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Diagnosis and management of genetic haemochromatosis.	Best practice & research. Clinical haematology	2002	0.5	Haemochromatosis may be inherited or acquired. The commonest inherited form is HFE-related genetic haemochromatosis (GH). This is associated with homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Individuals with GH present in several ways depending upon the severity of iron overload. However, only a small proportion of genetically susceptible individuals develop disease. Diagnosis of GH is based on measurement of transferrin saturation, serum ferritin levels and mutation analysis of HFE. Liver biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis. It is used to establish the severity of liver disease in selected patients. Other complications of iron overload are identified by specific tests. Initial management of GH is by weekly venesection until borderline iron deficiency is achieved. The serum ferritin is then maintained at 50 microg/l by 3-6 monthly venesection. Specific organ damage is managed appropriately. Early diagnosis and treatment before irreversible damage has occurred gives a normal life expectancy. Non-HFE related inherited iron overload may be due to mutations in other iron related genes. Management is along the same lines as for GH, although if venesection is not tolerated, other approaches may be necessary.	12401308
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE Mutations as risk factors in disease.	Best practice & research. Clinical haematology	2002	0.5	Iron deficiency is the most common disorder of iron metabolism worldwide, but there is concern that iron accumulation resulting from enhanced iron absorption may also be a cause of morbidity. In patients with genetic haemochromatosis the clinical manifestations of iron overload are well-known. In northern Europe 90% of such patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene and this genotype is found in 1 in 200 of the population. Heterozygosity for C282Y occurs in 15% of the population and 25% carry another mutation, H63D. Population studies have revealed (i) the serum transferrin saturation is strongly influenced by HFE genotype, being lowest in subjects lacking mutations and highest in those homozygous for C282Y; (ii) most subjects homozygous for C282Y accumulate iron but do not present with the clinical manifestations of iron overload. Testing for HFE mutations in clinics for diabetes, liver disease and cardiovascular disease has shown that homozygosity for C282Y is not commonly found. Heterozygosity for either C282Y or H63D does not appear to be a risk factor for these common conditions.	12401309
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	No increase in mortality and morbidity among carriers of the C282Y mutation of the hereditary haemochromatosis gene in the oldest old: the Leiden 85-plus study.	European journal of clinical investigation	2002	2.69	The C282Y mutation in the gene for haemochromatosis (HFE) has been associated with various diseases at middle age. However, recent studies indicate that penetrance of the C282Y mutation is low. We explored the association between the C282Y mutation, iron metabolism, and morbidity and mortality in participants of the Leiden 85-plus. A cross-sectional comparison and prospective follow-up was conducted in two unselected cohorts of 661 and 552 subjects. All subjects were aged 85 years and over. We determined the prevalence of C282Y homozygous and heterozygous subjects, and the association between the C282Y mutation and iron metabolism, all-cause and specific causes of death. Prevalence of C282Y homozygosity in both cohorts was 0.2% (1/661 and 1/552, respectively) and of C282Y heterozygosity was 12.4% (82/661) and 11.4% (63/552), respectively. These estimates coincide exactly with reported estimates in younger age groups. Median ferritin level was 97 microg L-1 (IQR 39-162) for heterozygous carriers and 89 microg L-1 (IQR 41-157) for noncarriers (P = 0.66). The serum ferritin concentration for one C282Y homozygous subject, a woman aged 86 years at the time of enrollment in 1986, was 392 microg L-1. Cardiovascular morbidity was comparable between the C282Y heterozygous subjects and the noncarriers in both study cohorts. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality of carriers of the C282Y mutation was similar to that in noncarriers. We found two C282Y homozygous subjects, illustrating that homozygosity can be compatible with survival in very old ages. C282Y heterozygosity was not associated with history of cardiovascular disease morbidity, all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, or biochemical phenotype of haemochromatosis at old age.	12406023
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE and non-HFE hemochromatosis.	International journal of hematology	2002	1.85	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a disorder of iron metabolism in which enhanced absorption of dietary iron causes increased iron accumulation in the liver, heart, and pancreas. Most individuals with HH are homozygous for a point mutation in the HFE gene, leading to a C282Y substitution in the HFE protein. The function of HFE protein is unknown, but the available evidence suggests that it acts in association with beta2-microglobulin and transferrin receptor 1 to regulate iron uptake from plasma transferrin by the duodenum, the proposed mechanism by which body iron levels are sensed. The identification of HFE has established the foundation for a better understanding of the molecular and cellular biology of iron homeostasis and its altered regulation in HH. Additionally, the ability to accurately diagnose iron overload disorders has been strengthened, family screening has been improved, and evaluation of patients with other forms of liver disease complicated by moderate-to-severe iron overload is now possible. However, the role of HFE testing in generalized population screening for HH is still controversial. Recently, other forms of HH have been described that are not related to HFE but are due to mutations in genes coding iron transport proteins.	12416729
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of coronary heart disease associated with HFE mutations in adults attending a health appraisal center.	The American journal of medicine	2002	0.5	Mutations of the HFE gene that cause hereditary hemochromatosis may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We examined the relation between two HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D), indicators of iron homeostasis, and the prevalence of coronary heart disease in a large population of white adults. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 30,916 white adults aged 25 to 98 years who attended a health appraisal center and underwent screening for HFE mutations. Coronary heart disease and cardiovascular risk factors were ascertained by questionnaire and medical records. Overall, 12% (1798/15,362) of men and 7% (1074/15,554) of women had a history of coronary heart disease. Of 10 HFE genotypes tested (five genotypes by sex), only men with the C282Y/H63D genotype (compound heterozygotes) had a significantly higher prevalence of coronary heart disease compared with men with no HFE mutations (odds ratio = 1.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.1 to 2.4; P = 0.01) after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. Elevated serum ferritin levels (>250 ng/mL) were associated with a lower prevalence of coronary heart disease in men (10% [255/2209] vs. 12% [1515/12,461] in controls, P = 0.008), which was not significant after adjusting for use of aspirin and anticoagulants. There were no significant associations between elevated transferrin saturation in either men or women, or between elevated serum ferritin levels or HFE mutations in women, and the prevalence of coronary heart disease. The results do not support a consistent association between HFE mutations or serum iron indicators and the prevalence of coronary heart disease.	12427496
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effect of iron supplementation on iron status during the first week after blood donation.	Vox sanguinis	2010	2.63	Frequent blood donations may lead to a negative iron balance. Iron depletion may be prevented by iron supplementation after whole blood donations. The aim of this study was to compare the short time changes in iron status after donation in two groups randomized to iron supplementation or no additional iron. A second objective was to evaluate the effect of iron supplementation in donors having HFE-variants compared to HFE wild types. Subjects of both genders (199 women, 200 men) were randomised to receive iron supplementation or no additional iron after donation. Iron status, defined by the concentration of haemoglobin, serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, concentration of haemoglobin in reticulocytes (CHr) and percent hypochrome mature red blood cells, was determined at the start of donation and 8 +/- 2 days after donation. HFE genotyping was performed at reappearance. There was a significant difference between the two study groups on all the iron status parameters. CHr was an efficient, early marker of ongoing synthesis of haemoglobin. Heterozygosity for the HFE variants C282Y and H63D had no statistically significant influence on the iron status. The donor's baseline serum ferritin value may be basis for an individual iron supplementation regimen, as donors with serum ferritin >50 microg/l do not seem to utilize the iron supplementation, but prefer endogenous iron to restore the loss of haemoglobin. Iron supplementation had a significant positive impact on the restoration of iron status one week after donation.	19874572
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Lack of association of C282Y and H63D mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene with diabetes mellitus type 2 in a case-control study of women in Brazil.	Genetics and molecular research : GMR	2009	0.76	Hereditary hemochromatosis is one of the most common autosomal recessive diseases; it is characterized by excess absorption of iron. Clinically, the major challenge is to diagnose increased iron deposition before irreversible tissue damage has occurred. C282Y and H63D are the main mutations related to hereditary hemochromatosis; these mutations have been reported to be associated with increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). We investigated whether these mutations are associated with increased risk for the development of DM2 in women in Brazil. Seventy-two women with clinical diagnosis of DM2 under treatment with hypoglycemic agents and a control group composed of 72 women with no clinical history of diabetes were studied. The C282Y and H63D mutations were determined by PCR-RFLP. Significant differences were not observed for C282Y and H63D, when we compared diabetic and non-diabetic women. We suggest that mutations C282Y and H63D in the HFE gene are not significant risk factors for the development of DM2 in Brazilian women.	19876870
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A common SNP near BMP2 is associated with severity of the iron burden in HFE p.C282Y homozygous patients: a follow-up study.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2010	0.5	It is now generally admitted that penetrance of the common HFE p.C282Y/p.C282Y genotype is incomplete, and identification of modifier genes is the concern of a growing number of research projects. We recently identified a significant association between pretherapeutic serum ferritin level and the common rs235756 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the BMP2 gene region. Our results further suggested an interactive effect between the BMP2 rs235756 SNP and the rs16827043 SNP in HJV, with a small additive effect of the rs4901474 SNP in BMP4. The present study has been designed as a replication study in an independent cohort of 450 HFE p.C282Y homozygous patients from a nearby French region (Brittany). Information on individual alcohol consumption and amount of iron removed by phlebotomy being available for a substantial part of this cohort, additional analyses were conducted. Only the use of the Amount of Iron Removed by phlebotomy (AIR) as marker of iron burden has provided positive results. Indeed, a significant association was detected between rs235756 and AIR adjusted for sex and age, with a mean AIR increasing with the number of BMP2 T alleles in the genotype groups. The effect of rs235657 was not strong enough to detect effects of gene combinations. Still, the trend in two-locus genotype risks involving BMP2 and HJV for AIR was concordant with the specific interactive effect described in the initial study. Although we failed to replicate results of the initial study, we argue that, altogether, our results help to consider genes involved in the regulation of hepcidin synthesis as potential modifiers of the p.C282Y/pC282Y genotype expression and especially BMP2.	19879168
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Relationship between gene expression of duodenal iron transporters and iron stores in hemochromatosis subjects.	American journal of physiology. Gastrointestinal and liver physiology	2010	0.5	"""To test the hypothesis that differences in duodenal iron absorption may explain the variable phenotypic expression among HFE C282Y homozygotes, we have compared relative gene expression of duodenal iron transporters among C282Y homozygotes [hereditary hemochromatosis (HH)] with and without iron overload. Duodenal biopsy samples were analyzed using real-time PCR for expression of DMT1, FPN1, DCYTB, and HEPH relative to GAPDH from 23 C282Y homozygotes, including 5 """"nonexpressors"""" (serum ferritin < upper limit of normal and absence of phenotypic features of hemochromatosis) and 18 """"expressors."""" Four subjects of wild type for HFE mutations without iron overload or liver disease served as controls. There was a significant difference in expression of DMT1 (P = 0.03) and DMT1(IRE) (P = 0.0013) but not FPN1, DCYTB, or HEPH between groups. Expression of DMT1(IRE) was increased among HH subjects after phlebotomy compared with untreated (P = 0.006) and nonexpressor groups (P = 0.026). A positive relationship was observed among all HH subjects regardless of phenotype or treatment status between relative expression of FPN1 and DMT1 (r = 0.5854, P = 0.0021), FPN1, and DCYTB (r = 0.5554, P = 0.0040), FPN1 and HEPH (r = 0.5100, P = 0.0092), and DCYTB and HEPH (r = 0.5400, P = 0.0053). In summary, phlebotomy is associated with upregulation of DMT1(IRE) expression in HH subjects. HFE C282Y homozygotes without phenotypic expression do not have significantly decreased duodenal gene expression of iron transport genes compared with HH subjects with iron overload. There is coordinated regulation between duodenal expression of FPN1 and DMT1, FPN1 and DCYTB, and FPN1 and HEPH and also DCYTB and HEPH in HH subjects regardless of phenotype."""	19892936
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for iron overload: lessons from the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening (HEIRS) study.	Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie	2009	0.5	The HEmochromatosis and IRon Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study provided data on a racially, ethnically and geographically diverse cohort of participants in North America screened from primary care populations. A total of 101,168 participants were screened by testing for HFE C282Y and H63D mutations, and measuring serum ferritin concentration and transferrin saturation. In the present review, lessons from the HEIRS Study are highlighted in the context of the principles of screening for a medical disease as previously outlined by the World Health Organization. Genetic testing is well accepted, with minimal risk of discrimination. Transferrin saturation has high biological variability and relatively low sensitivity to detect HFE C282Y homozygotes, which limits its role as a screening test. Symptoms attributable to HFE C282Y homozygosity are no more common in individuals identified by population screening than in control subjects. Generalized population screening in a primary care population as performed in the HEIRS Study is not recommended. There may be a role for focused screening in Caucasian men, with some debate regarding genotyping followed by phenotyping, or phenotyping followed by genotyping.	19893773
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis: advances in molecular genetics and clinical diagnosis.	Journal of clinical gastroenterology	1998	3.16	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a human leukocyte antigen-linked inherited disease that is characterized by inappropriately high absorption of iron by the gastrointestinal mucosa. The spectrum of disease presentation is changing with more and more patients now being identified before they are symptomatic with complications of iron overload. A candidate gene for HH, called HFE, was identified in 1996, and a test for the gene is commercially available. A review of the recent identification of the gene and its implications for clinical diagnosis and therapy is presented. We also propose an algorithm for evaluation of patients for HH. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy can prevent significant morbidity and mortality associated with the development of end-organ complications of HH. The understanding of the C282Y and H63D mutations is still evolving, and the algorithm and the contribution of various heterozygous mutations to the diagnosis and management of iron overload need to be confirmed by further clinical and genetic studies.	9706768
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis: a genetic defect in iron metabolism.	BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology	1998	4.72	Hemochromatosis (HC), the common inherited disorder in iron metabolism, affects at least 1 in 300 Caucasians. The disorder causes inappropriately high iron absorption and accumulation of excess iron in the parenchymal cells of the major organs of the body. The gene responsible for HC has recently been cloned and is termed HFE; two missense mutations have been reported in the gene, both cause amino acid substitutions (H63D and C282Y), but to date only the C282Y mutation has been found to clearly correlate with HC in all affected populations. HFE is highly homologous to genes in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I family; all of these genes encode a heterodimeric protein which is complexed to beta 2-microglobulin, a coupling essential for cell surface expression of a functional molecule. The first important step toward establishing the role of HFE in the pathogenesis of HC came with the recent observation that the C282Y mutation disrupts the binding of beta 2-microglobulin to the HFE protein and as a result the mutant molecule is not expressed on the cell surface.	9723005
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Influence of mutation of the HFE gene on the progression of chronic viral hepatitis B and C in Moroccan patients.	Journal of medical virology	2011	2.0	The implication of hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations in chronic viral hepatitis remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to measure the frequencies of the common HFE gene mutations in Moroccan subjects with chronic viral hepatitis B and C and to assess their influence on the progression of liver disease. H63D and C282Y mutations were screened by the polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in 170 chronic hepatitis B patients, 168 chronic hepatitis C patients, and 200 healthy controls. A very small proportion of patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV; 1.8% and none, respectively) were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, that is, rates not statistically different from those observed in healthy control (2%, P > 0.05). Similarly, the frequency of the H63D allele was not significantly different between HBV (13.8%) or HCV (14.3%) patients and controls (13.5%, P > 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that carriers of the H63D mutation infected with HBV are at higher risk to progress towards an advanced liver disease when compared with patients infected with HBV with wild-type (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.07-5.58). In contrast, no association between HFE mutated HCV-infected patients and an increased risk of disease progression was found (OR =  1.24, 95% CI = 0.61-2.50, P = 0.547). In conclusion, in Morocco the frequency of the HFE C282Y allele is very low and H63D mutation carriage occurs in almost 14% of the patients, a rate similar in chronic hepatitis patients and healthy controls. In the case of chronic hepatitis B, the carriage of the H63D variant represents a risk factor of evolution towards a more active disease.	22012716
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Integration of combined heteroduplex/restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on an electrophoresis microchip for the detection of hereditary haemochromatosis.	The Analyst	2004	0.5	This work describes an integrated method of enzymatic digestion, heteroduplex analysis (HA) and electrophoretic sizing on a microfluidic chip. HA techniques based on microchip electrophoresis are capable of the high sensitivity detection of subtle mutations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) but are not readily able to detect homozygous mutant genotypes. Such homozygous conditions are commonly encountered with the gene implicated in hereditary haemochromatosis, HFE. We employed the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method of mutation detection to complement the HA method in a rapid novel on-chip procedure that separated digested PCR fragments to reliably determine the presence or absence of the most important mutations associated with haemochromatosis. This method was able to distinguish the homozygous mutant, heterozygous and homozygous wildtype genotypes. The mutations investigated here (C282Y, H63D and S65C) are often the mutation targets used in the genetic testing for haemochromatosis. This method provides the extremely specific digestion methods needed for the analysis of the known and relatively common mutations that have a significant probability of occurring in a homozygous form. However, the high sensitivity of the HA method is useful in detecting other mutations of lesser likelihood which, by virtue of their rarity, are likely to be present only in a heterozygous form. Although the conventional methods of analysing these mutations require as much as a day to perform, this microchip method, even without robotics or multiplexed operation, can be performed in about 10 min per sample.	14737579
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Correlation between iron status and genetic hemochromatosis (codon C282Y) in a large German population.	The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ	2004	0.5	Genetic hemochromatosis leads to iron overload in many tissues and may lead to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Early diagnosis and therapy are crucial. Since 80-100% of hemochromatosis patients of European origin are homozygous for a cysteine to tyrosine exchange in the HFE gene at codon 282, genetic screening might be useful. Representative population studies are needed to evaluate the phenotype of people heterozygous and homozygous for the C282Y mutation. To determine the correlation between parameters of iron metabolism and the hemochromatosis genotype in a large population-based study. A representative population-based survey, the Diabetomobil study, analyzed 5,083 German probands. Serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels were determined, and the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene was analyzed by restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Nine of 373 probands with a transferrin saturation > 55% (2.4%) and none of 264 randomly selected probands with a transferrin saturation < or = 55% (0%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Three of the nine homozygous probands had ferritin values less than 250 micrograms/L. The frequency of the heterozygous genotype was 8.8%, and the percentage of heterozygous probands increased with increasing levels of transferrin saturation. We propose a population screening strategy with an initial transferrin saturation test, followed by genotyping for the C282Y mutation if the transferrin saturation is above 55%, regardless of the ferritin level. Heterozygous individuals with higher transferrin saturation values may be protected against iron loss but may also be more susceptible for certain liver diseases, depending on the simultaneous prevalence of other diseases.	14740507
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Risk-factor profile in severe, generalized, obliterating vascular disease.	Southern medical journal	2004	0.88	A 74-year-old woman had a history over 25 years of endarterectomy of both renal arteries, iliac venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, left internal carotid artery endarterectomy, coronary angioplasty, aortocoronary bypass grafting, occlusion of the right axillary artery, lower-limb claudication due to common iliac artery aneurysm, external iliac artery stenosis, multiple femoral artery stenoses, bifurcational stent grafting, occlusion of the left brachial artery and the right external iliac artery, and stroke. Assessment of the risk-factor profile revealed an absence of classic risk factors but the presence of the factor V Leiden mutation, the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase AI298C mutation, the HFE C282Y mutation, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene mutation, the -455 G/A fibrinogen gene polymorphism, the epsilon3/epsilon4 apolipoprotein E -675 4G gene polymorphism, and hyperhomocysteinemia. This case shows that severe, generalized, occlusive vascular disease may be due to the combination of various genetic risk factors for atherosclerosis and venous thromboembolism.	14746432
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Relative contribution of iron burden, HFE mutations, and insulin resistance to fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2004	0.5	The mechanism(s) determining the progression from fatty liver to steatohepatitis is currently unknown. Our goal was to define the relative impact of iron overload, genetic mutations of HFE, and insulin resistance on the severity of liver fibrosis in a population of subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who had low prevalence of obesity and no overt symptoms of diabetes. In a cohort of 263 prospectively enrolled patients with NAFLD, 7.4% of patients had signs of peripheral iron overload and 9% had signs of hepatic iron overload, but 21.1% had hyperferritinemia. The prevalence of C282Y and H63D HFE mutations was similar to the general population and mutations were not associated with iron overload. Although subjects were on average only moderately overweight, insulin sensitivity, measured both in the fasting state and in response to oral glucose, was lower. Univariate analysis demonstrated that the presence of severe fibrosis was independently associated with older age, female sex, overweight, aspartate/alanine aminotransferase ratio, serum ferritin level, fasting glucose and insulin levels, decreased insulin sensitivity, and with histologic features (degree of necroinflammation and steatosis). After adjustment for body mass index (BMI), age, sex, and degree of steatosis, ferritin levels (odds ratio [OR] = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.21- 2.58; P =.0032) and the oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OR = 0.53; CI = 0.33-0.87; P =.0113) were independent predictors of severe fibrosis. In conclusion, the current study indicates that insulin resistance is a major, independent risk factor for advanced fibrosis in patients with NAFLD. Increased ferritin levels are markers of severe histologic damage, but not of iron overload. Iron burden and HFE mutations do not contribute significantly to hepatic fibrosis in the majority of patients with NAFLD.	14752836
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The natural history of untreated HFE-related hemochromatosis.	Acta haematologica	2009	1.05	Hemochromatosis has generally been considered to be a genetic disease in which progressive iron accumulation over many years can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and arthropathy. Iron depletion by phlebotomy has been the recommended therapy although a randomized trial of phlebotomy versus no treatment has never been reported. Since the discovery of the HFE gene in 1996, it has been possible to predict the risk of developing iron overload by a simple blood test to detect C282Y homozygotes of the HFE gene. The application of the hemochromatosis genetic test in large population studies often initiated to investigate other diseases has provided a fascinating glimpse into the natural history of untreated C282Y homozygotes followed for over 20 years without phlebotomy treatment. These observations are summarized in this review article which raises questions about the need for phlebotomy in all C282Y homozygous patients.	19907150
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepatic and cardiac iron overload among patients with end-stage liver disease referred for liver transplantation.	Clinical transplantation		1.84	Iron overload is associated with fatal cardiovascular events following liver transplantation. Myocardial iron deposits were observed post-mortem in patients who died of cardiac events after transplantation at our institution. This observation prompted testing to exclude cardiac iron in subsequent transplant candidates. To assess the results of testing for iron overload in liver transplant candidates at our institution. Ferritin, TIBC, and serum iron were measured in cirrhotics referred for transplantation. Patients with transferrin saturation ≥50% and ferritin ≥250 ng/mL underwent liver biopsy graded for iron. Patients with 3-4+ hepatic iron deposits underwent HFE mutation analysis and endomyocardial biopsy with iron staining. Eight hundred and fifty-six patients were evaluated for liver transplantation between January 1997 and March 2005. Two hundred and eighty-seven patients (34%) had transferrin saturation ≥50% and ferritin ≥250 ng/mL. Patients with markers of iron overload had more advanced liver disease than those with normal iron indices. One hundred and fifty-three patients underwent liver biopsy. Twenty-six patients (17%) had 3-4+ hepatic iron staining. One patient was a C282Y heterozygote. Endomyocardial biopsy was performed in 14 patients of whom nine had cardiac iron deposition. Non-HFE-related cardiac iron overload can occur in advanced liver disease We therefore recommend screening for cardiac iron prior to liver transplantation.	19925473
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Implementation of ironXS: a study of the acceptability and feasibility of genetic screening for hereditary hemochromatosis in high schools.	Clinical genetics	2010	3.89	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), most often due to HFE C282Y homozygosity, is an iron overload disorder that can result in severe morbidity including hepatic cirrhosis. Predisposition to HH is easily diagnosed and morbidity is preventable by maintaining normal body iron and thus calls have been made to introduce community screening. The current study has been designed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of HH screening in high schools. Students (mostly 15-16 years of age) watched a purpose-designed DVD for education about HH. Those with parental consent were then offered cheek-brush screening for C282Y. Students completed a questionnaire prior to screening. The program was offered to 9187 students at 32 schools and 3489 (38%) had screening. Nineteen C282Y homozygotes (1 in 183) and 376 heterozygotes (1 in 9.3) were identified. More than 90% of students answered each of five knowledge questions correctly. Eight homozygotes (42%) had elevated transferrin saturation, but only two (10.5%) had marginally elevated serum ferritin (SF). We have shown that genetic screening for HH can successfully be offered in the high school setting. Ongoing research in this study will answer questions about the impact of high school students learning that they are at risk of HH.	19930418
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotype, parenchymal iron accumulation, and liver fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.	Gastroenterology	2010	18.19	Mutations in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) (C282Y and H63D) lead to parenchymal iron accumulation, hemochromatosis, and liver damage. We investigated whether these factors also contribute to the progression of fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We studied clinical, histologic (liver biopsy samples for hepatocellular iron accumulation), serologic (iron and enzyme levels), and genetic (HFE genotype) data from 587 patients from Italy with NAFLD and 184 control subjects. Iron accumulation predominantly in hepatocyes was associated with a 1.7-fold higher risk of a fibrosis stage greater than 1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-2.3), compared with the absence of siderosis (after adjustment for age, body mass index, glucose tolerance status, and alanine aminotransferase level). Nonparenchymal/mixed siderosis was not associated with moderate/severe fibrosis (odds ratio, 0.72; 95% CI: 0.50-1.01). Hepatocellular siderosis was more prevalent in patients with HFE mutations than in those without; approximately one third of patients with HFE mutations had parenchymal iron accumulation (range, 29.8%-35.7%, depending on HFE genotype). Predominantly hepatocellular iron accumulation occurred in 52.7% of cases of patients with HFE mutations. There was no significant association between either the presence of HFE mutations or specific HFE genotypes and the severity of liver fibrosis. Iron deposition predominantly in hepatocyes is associated with more severe liver damage in patients with NAFLD. However, HFE mutations cannot be used to identify patients with hepatocellular iron accumulation.	19931264

Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	"""Mutations in aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2) are usually associated with sideroblastic anemia and iron overload. The objective of this study was to determine if """"mild"""" mutations in ALAS2 might increase the severity of primary iron overload. Direct sequencing of the ALAS2 gene was performed on 24 subjects with primary hemochromatosis and one subject with sideroblastic anemia with severe iron overload. We identified a novel mutation P520L (c. 1559 C --> T) in ALAS2 in three subjects. Two had severe iron overload and no anemia: one also had HFE C282Y homozygosity, and the other was wildtype for HFE and other iron-related genes. The third subject had sideroblastic anemia with iron overload, and was hemizygous for both P520L and R560H (c. 1679 G --> A) mutations in ALAS2. The P520L mutation was found at a frequency of 0.0013 (741 alleles) in white control subjects, but was not found in 158 alleles from black control subjects. The proline in this position is highly conserved across species from humans to zebrafish. However, genotype/phenotype studies of the families demonstrate that the P520L mutation alone has no iron-associated phenotype, but it may act as a modifier of iron overload in the presence of mutations in HFE or other uncharacterized hemochromatosis genes. Thus, ALAS2 mutations might contribute to more severe iron loading in persons with primary hemochromatosis."""	16446107
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Initial screening transferrin saturation values, serum ferritin concentrations, and HFE genotypes in Native Americans and whites in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study.	Clinical genetics	2006	3.89	We compared initial screening transferrin saturation (TfSat) and serum ferritin (SF) phenotypes and HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes of 645 Native American and 43,453 white Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study participants who did not report a previous diagnosis of hemochromatosis or iron overload. Elevated measurements were defined as TfSat >50% in men and >45% in women and SF >300 ng/ml in men and >200 ng/ml in women. Mean TfSat was 31% in Native American men and 32% in white men (p = 0.0337) and 25% in Native American women and 27% in white women (p < 0.0001). Mean SF was 153 microg/l in Native American and 151 microg/l in white men (p = 0.8256); mean SF was 55 microg/l in Native American women and 63 microg/l in white women (p = 0.0015). The C282Y allele frequency was 0.0340 in Native Americans and 0.0683 in whites (p < 0.0001). The H63D allele frequency was 0.1150 in Native Americans and 0.1532 in whites (p = 0.0001). We conclude that the screening TfSat and SF phenotypes of Native Americans are similar to those of whites. The allele frequencies of HFE C282Y and H63D are significantly lower in Native Americans than in whites.	16451136
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotypes in decompensated alcoholic liver disease: phenotypic expression and comparison with heavy drinking and with normal controls.	The American journal of gastroenterology	2006	0.5	Predisposition to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) may be partly genetic. Heterozygosity for the HFE mutations C282Y and/or H63D has been associated with more severe disease in several liver conditions. Studies in ALD have not used controls matched for alcohol consumption and results have been conflicting. HFE genotyping was performed in two Caucasian heavy-drinking cohorts (>60 units/wk (M) or 40 units/wk (F) for >5 yr): (a) 254 patients with decompensated ALD (Child's grade B or C), (b) 130 controls with similar alcohol consumption but without liver disease. Results in males were also compared with those from another study of healthy male blood donors. (1) Genotype distributions for the C282Y and H63D mutations were similar in ALD patients, heavy-drinking controls, and healthy blood donors. (2) ALD patients with and without HFE mutations had similar disease severity, age at presentation, and alcohol consumption. (3) Increased serum ferritin and % transferrin saturation were seen in 63% and 29% of ALD patients, regardless of HFE genotype; the increased % transferrin saturation was due to reduced unsaturated iron binding capacity, rather than increased serum iron. (4) Stainable liver iron was present in 52% of patients; grade was greater in patients with two HFE mutations than in those with one or with none. (5) Only the two C282Y homozygote patients had substantial iron overload. Although serum iron abnormalities are common, C282Y and H63D mutation frequencies were not increased in heavy drinkers with decompensated liver disease. HFE mutations, although modestly influencing liver iron, do not predispose to clinically significant ALD.	16454835
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Abnormal regulation of HFE mRNA expression does not contribute to primary iron overload.	Haematologica	2000	6.67	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is a common, recessively inherited, genetic disorder associated with an abnormality of the HFE gene. Subjects homozygous for a point mutation in the gene coding sequence, leading to the amino acid substitution C282Y, are usually affected by the disease. A second point mutation, causing the amino acid substitution H63D, has been described, and compound heterozygotes for the two mutations or homozygotes for the H63D mutation are at risk of developing a milder form of HHC. In populations of northern European origin the C282Y substitution accounts for more than 90% of cases of HHC. In Italy, however, fewer than 70% of patients with HHC are homozygous or compound heterozygous for HFE mutations. Even in the absence of mutations in its coding region, the HFE gene might be involved in the pathogenesis of HHC through inhibition of transcription of the gene or reduced stability of its mRNA. Since little is known about the regulation of HFE expression, we investigated 17 subjects heterozygous for one of the HFE mutations and with biochemical evidence of iron overload and compared the levels of wild type and mutated mRNAs in their peripheral blood cells. c-DNA regions flanking the mutated codons were amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR products derived from the two alleles were differentiated and quantified by digestion with restriction enzymes, electrophoresis in an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and densitometric scanning of the gel. In all cases wild type and mutated mRNAs were expressed at similar levels, suggesting that reduced expression of an HFE allele coding a normal protein is not involved in the pathogenesis of iron overload. However, we can not rule out that a tissue specific regulation of HFE expression in the cells directly involved in iron absorption is altered and contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease. E INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that primary iron overload is a multigenic syndrome; this hypothesis is strongly supported by the recent demonstration that the juvenile hemochromatosis locus maps to human chromosome 1q.	10942923
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A common intron 3 mutation (IVS3 -48c-->g) leads to misdiagnosis of the c.845G-->A (C282Y) HFE gene mutation.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2000	0.5	Amplification of the region of the HFE gene that contains the c.845G-->A (C282Y) mutation is usually performed using one amplimer that binds to a sequence in intron 3 and another that binds to a sequence in intron 4. Previously, a mutation that interferes with efficient binding to the intron 4 site has been described. We now find that another common mutation in intron 3, IVS3 -48c-->g, prevents binding of the amplimer to that site. This polymorphism occurs at a gene frequency of 0.128 in the African-American population and at a frequency of only 0.006 in the European population. DNA samples heterozygous for the IVS3 -48c-->g polymorphism and C282Y were undistinguishable from samples homozygous for the C282Y mutation when they were examined by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (ASOH) and showed only a weak normal band when examined by electrophoresis following restriction endonuclease digestion. Although the polymorphism occurs in a DNA sequence almost identical to the intron 3 splice donor site, we found no evidence of alternative splice forms. Moreover, serum iron, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin levels were normal in subjects heterozygous for the polymorphism. It appears, therefore, that the main importance of this polymorphism is that it may lead to misdiagnosis of heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation as homozygotes. We therefore recommend exonic amplimers that avoid sites that contain polymorphisms and that can be multiplexed for detection of the c.187C-->G (H63D) and c.845G-->A (C282Y) mutations.	10950943
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for hemochromatosis in routine medical care: an evaluation of mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	"""Our aim was to evaluate the potential utility of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) to detect hemochromatosis. We computed the accuracy of MCV and MCH cut-off points > or = upper reference limits using data from 94 probands and 132 white controls. Our reference ranges are MCV 80.0-97.0 fL and MCH 26.0-32.0 pg. Sensitivity of MCV was 8.6-48.3% for men and 2.8-44.4% for women (cut-off points > or = 105.0 - > or = 97.0 fL, respectively). Sensitivity of MCH was 33.9-70.7% for men and 19.6-50.0% for women (cut-off points > or = 34.0 - > or = 32.0 pg, respectively). Using MCV and a hemochromatosis frequency typical of many western Caucasian populations (0.005), positive predictive values (PV+) were 2.1-100.0% in men and 4.2-100.0% in women. Using MCH, PV+ were 1.7-8.2% in men and 1.8-6.8% in women. We also calculated PV+ using the hemochromatosis frequency 0.015, which could occur in persons receiving medical care. Using MCV cut-off points > or = 101.0 fL, PV+ were 8.9-100.0% in men and 100.0% in women with maximum sensitivities of 24.1% and 25.0%, respectively. Using MCH testing, PV+ was 21.5% in men (cut-off point > or = 34.0 pg) and 18.2% in women (cut-off point > or = 33.0 pg) with sensitivities of 33.9% and 37.0%, respectively. Using MCV or MCH, sensitivity and PV+ for the HFE genotype C282Y/C282Y were generally greater than for """"nonclassical"""" HFE genotypes. All negative predictive values in our study were > or = 98.5%. We conclude that supranormal values of MCV or MCH could be used to detect hemochromatosis in white persons of western European descent who are receiving routine medical care. Comparisons of MCV, MCH, and transferrin saturation testing and other implications of MCV and MCH testing for hemochromatosis in medical care are discussed."""	10953947
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Population screening for hemochromatosis by PCR using sequence-specific primers.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	Over 90% of patients with hemochromatosis in the United Kingdom are homozygous for the C282Y mutation on the HFE gene. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States has recommended that adults should be screened for HFE mutations to identify susceptible individuals before onset of disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) as a method of large-scale population screening for the common HFE gene mutations, H63D and C282Y. A total of 10,583 consenting blood donors were tested using nonautomated procedures. Three alleles, termed HFE-1, -2, and -3, were detected with phenotype frequencies of 94.56%, 28.33%, and 15.79%, respectively, and gene frequencies of 0.76421, 0.15342, and 0.08237, respectively. All donors identified as homozygous for the C282Y mutation or heterozygous for both the H63D and C282Y mutations were confirmed by heterduplex analysis and/or PCR-SSP. The number of technical failures that affected the identification of donors homozygous for the C282Y mutation was 390 giving an overall repeat rate 3.7%, although this fell to 1% over the last quarter of the study. This study demonstrates that PCR-SSP may be used for large-scale population screening for the C282Y genotype associated with hemochromatosis.	10953948
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Detection of C282Y and H63D in the HFE gene.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	The gene for hemochromatosis was identified in 1996 and two mutations were found. Homozygosity for one of these, C282Y, is associated with hemochromatosis in a high percentage of patients. Genetic analysis of patient DNA is, therefore, a very useful tool to aid and confirm diagnosis and to screen asymptomatic relatives of patients to identify those at risk of developing this common, easily treated disease.	10953949
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Pitfalls in the genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	The widespread use of the genotype assay that identifies the common C282Y mutation in the HFE gene has allowed an earlier diagnosis to be made in many subjects. A significant number of these patients may have no evidence of phenotypic disease and have a normal serum ferritin level. This phenomenon is more common when the genotype assay is used to screen populations rather than higher-risk groups such as family members of a proband with hereditary hemochromatosis. Moreover, patients with significant iron overload may be wild type for the C282Y mutation and have no other demonstrable mutation of the HFE gene. The HFE genotype assay has recently been found to give a false-positive C282Y homozygous result in half of the subjects in one population screening study due to the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that interfered with primer binding in the PCR assay. The problem may be overcome by using alternate primers. A number of other groups have confirmed the finding but in a much smaller number of subjects, whereas others found that their assays were not affected by the SNP. The use of the HFE genotype assay as the sole diagnostic criterion for hereditary hemochromatosis is not recommended. The genotype assay should be used as an adjunct to the established methods of demonstrating iron overload and be viewed as a predictor of either the presence of iron overload or the subsequent development of iron overload during an individual's lifetime.	10953953
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	5569G/A polymorphism of the HFE gene: no implications for C282Y genotyping in a hemochromatosis screening study of 65,238 individuals.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	In a previous hemochromatosis screening study including a total of 65,238 individuals, 566 persons were genotyped for the C282Y and the H63D mutations. Of these, a total of 433 samples (298 homozygous C282Y and 135 homozygous wild type) were reanalyzed to investigate if the potential presence of the newly described 5569G/A polymorphism had confounded the genotyping results for the C282Y mutation. Genotyping with a polymorphism-insensitive primer pair yielded no samples that altered their genotype. By utilizing the polymorphism-sensitive primer pair and elevated annealing temperatures, 133 samples previously genotyped as heterozygous C282Y were reanalyzed to verify the presence of the polymorphism in the population studied. Out of a total of 266 chromosomes, we found the polymorphism present in 9 chromosomes, yielding an allele frequency of 0.034 in this particular subpopulation. In one of the samples, the polymorphism was present on the same DNA strand as the C282Y mutation. We conclude that in the population studied, the 5569 G/A polymorphism is present, but its presence had no implications for the outcome of the previous genotyping. Nevertheless, we recommend that C282Y genotyping by restriction endonuclease digestion of PCR products in the future should utilize a primer pair that is not influenced by the 5569G/A polymorphism.	10953954
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Uncommon mutations and polymorphisms in the hemochromatosis gene.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism. Iron absorption from the gut is inappropriately high, resulting in increasing iron overload. The hemochromatosis gene (HFE) was identified in 1996 by extensive positional cloning by many groups over a period of about 20 years. Two missense mutations were identified. Homozygosity for one of these, a substitution of a tyrosine for a conserved cysteine (C282Y), has now clearly been shown to be associated with HH in 60-100% of patients. The role of the second mutation, the substitution of an aspartic acid for a histidine (H63D), is not so clear but compound heterozygotes for both these mutations have a significant risk of developing HH. Here we review other putative mutations in the HFE gene and document a number of diallelic polymorphisms in HFE introns.	10953955
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Celtic origin of the C282Y mutation of hemochromatosis.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	The main hereditary hemochromatosis mutation C282Y in the HFE gene was recently described, and the C282Y frequencies were reported for various European populations. The aim of this synthesis is to compile the Y allele frequencies of the C282Y mutation for 40 European populations. The most elevated values are observed in residual Celtic populations in Ireland, the United Kingdom, and France, in accordance with the hypothesis of Simon et al. (1980) concerning a Celtic origin of the hereditary hemochromatosis mutation.	10953956
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis in Spain.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	The C282Y mutation of the HFE gene has been reported as the main cause of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). Another missense mutation (H63D) has also been detected at an increased frequency in a compound heterozygote state with the C282Y mutation in HH patients. However, these two mutations are not present in all of the HH patients, indicating that other mutations in the HFE gene, or in other loci, should exist. The present study reports the frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations in 74 Spanish HH patients and the results of the sequencing analysis of the HFE exons, intron-exon boundaries, and 588 bp of the 5' region in 5 patients negative for the C282Y mutation. We have detected a high frequency of the C282Y mutation (85.1%) in Spanish HH patients, indicating that this mutation is the most common defect associated with the disease in Spain. The screening of the HFE regions in our patients without the C282Y mutation has revealed the presence of five polymorphisms. However, no other pathological mutations have been found. Therefore, further efforts to characterize the unscreened part of the HFE gene or other loci should be taken to identify the potential genetic factors causing HH in the C282Y-negative patients.	10953957
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A pilot C282Y hemochromatosis screening in Italian newborns by TaqMan technology.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a disorder of iron metabolism that leads to iron overload in middle age and can be caused by homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Preliminary studies have estimated the frequency of this mutation at 0.5-1% in Italy, but this has not been verified on a large sample. We analyzed 1,331 Italian newborns for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene using dried blood spots (DBS) from the Neonatal Screening Center in Turin, Italy. The mutation was assessed using a semi-automatable 5'-nuclease assay (TaqMan technology). We detected 55 heterozygotes and no homozygotes in our sampling, resulting in an overall frequency of 2.1% +/- 0.6 for the C282Y allele. Differences in allele frequency were observed, and ranged from 2.7% +/- 1.3 in samples from Northern Italy, to 1.7% +/- 0.9 in samples from Central-Southern Italy. The low frequency of the at-risk genotype for iron overload suggests that genetic screening for HFE in Italy would not be cost effective. The present study, in addition to defining C282Y frequency, documents detection of the major HFE mutation on routine DBS samples from neonatal screening programs using a semi-automatable, rapid, reliable, and relatively inexpensive approach.	10953958
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Geography of HFE C282Y and H63D mutations.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder causing inappropriate dietary iron absorption that affects North Europeans. HH is associated with the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, and the H63D mutation to a lesser degree. Both mutations are abundant in Europe, with H63D also appearing in North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Emigration from Europe over the past 500 years has introduced C282Y and H63D to America, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa in an essentially predictable fashion. The distinctive characteristics of the population genetics of HH are the confined racial distribution and high frequency in North European peoples. C282Y frequencies in North Europeans are typically between 5% and 10%, with homozygotes accounting for between 1/100 and 1/400 of these populations. The scarcity of the C282Y mutation in other populations accounts for the lack of HH in non-Europeans.	10953959
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Transferrin saturation phenotype and HFE genotype screening for hemochromatosis and primary iron overload: predictions from a model based on national, racial, and ethnic group composition in central Alabama.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	There is interest in general population screening for hemochromatosis and other primary iron overload disorders, although not all persons are at equal risk. We developed a model to estimate the numbers of persons in national, racial, or ethnic population subgroups in Jefferson County, Alabama, who would be detected using transferrin saturation (phenotype) or HFE mutation analysis (genotype) screening. Approximately 62% are Caucasians, 37% are African Americans, and the remainder are Hispanics, Asians, or Native Americans. The predicted phenotype frequencies are greatest in a Caucasian subgroup, ethnicity unspecified, which consists predominantly of persons of Scotch and Irish descent (0.0065 men, 0.0046 women), and in African Americans (0.0089 men, 0.0085 women). Frequencies of the HFE genotype C282Y/C282Y > or = 0.0001 are predicted to occur only among Caucasians; the greatest frequency (0.0080) was predicted to occur in the ethnicity-unspecified Caucasian population. C282Y/C282Y frequency estimates were lower in Italian, Greek, and Jewish subgroups. There is excellent agreement in the numbers of the ethnicity-unspecified Caucasians who would be detected using phenotype and genotype criteria. Our model also indicates that phenotyping would identify more persons with primary iron overload than would genotyping in our Italian Caucasian, Hispanic, and African American subgroups. This is consistent with previous observations that indicate that primary iron overload disorders in persons of southern Italian descent and African Americans are largely attributable to non-HFE alleles. Because the proportions of population subgroups and their genetic constitution may differ significantly in other geographic regions, we suggest that models similar to the present one be constructed to predict optimal screening strategies for primary iron overload disorders.	10953960
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Is genetic screening for hemochromatosis worthwhile?	European journal of epidemiology	2004	7.11	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an iron overload disorder and is the most common recessive disease in Caucasians. About 80% of hemochromatosis patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Since iron accumulation can be prevented by phlebotomy, there is increasing interest in screening populations for hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a disease that meets all the criteria for screening as set by the World Health Organization (WHO) or the US preventive services task force criteria for a screening program. However, there is no consensus on the value of a screening program for hemochromatosis. Moreover, there is no agreement on whether this screening should be based on the phenotype i.e. biochemical levels of serum iron parameters or on the genotype i.e. based on the presence of mutations in the HFE gene. Other important concerns are the lack of important data in evaluating screening as well as the psychosocial impact of a screening program. The present review analyses the current situation from a genetic-epidemiological perspective. We conclude that general population screening may be helpful to identify high-risk groups or individuals in the early stage of the disease so that treatment can be started. We suggest a two-phase screening program based on the first instance on serum iron levels and then a genetic test to only those with elevated serum iron parameters.	15074564
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The impact of the mutations of the HFE gene and of the SLC11A3 gene on iron overload in Greek thalassemia intermedia and beta(s)/beta(thal) anemia patients.	Haematologica	2004	6.67	In this study, we evaluated the impact of mutations of the HFE and ferroportin gene on iron overload in thalassemia intermedia and betas/betathal patients. Neither HFE (C282Y and H63D) nor ferroportin(Val162del) mutations were determinants of total body iron status, as assessed by ferritin levels, in either group of patients.	15075083
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Implementation of HaemScreen, a workplace-based genetic screening program for hemochromatosis.	Clinical genetics	2004	3.89	There is debate as to whether community genetic screening for the mutation(s) causing hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) should be implemented, due to issues including disease penetrance, health economic outcomes, and concerns about community acceptance. Hemochromatosis is a common preventable iron overload disease, due in over 90% of cases to C282Y homozygosity in the HFE gene. We are, therefore, piloting C282Y screening to assess understanding of genetic information and screening acceptability in the workplace setting. In this program, HaemScreen, education was by oral or video presentation in a group setting. C282Y status was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and melt-curve analysis on DNA obtained by cheek-brush sampling. Of eligible participants, 5.8% (1.5-15.8%) attended information and screening sessions, of whom 97.7% (5571 individuals) chose to be tested. Twenty-two C282Y (1 : 253) homozygotes were identified and offered clinical follow-up. There were 638 heterozygotes (1 : 8.7). The determinants for participation have been analyzed in terms of the principles outlined in the Health Belief Model. Widespread screening for HH is readily accepted in a workplace setting, and a one-to-many education program is effective. The level of participation varies greatly and the advertizing and session logistics should be adapted to the specific features of each workplace.	15099342
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations and hepatitis C virus infection as risk factors for porphyria cutanea tarda in Hungarian patients.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2004	4.47	It is not clear whether the mutations in hemochromatosis (HFE) gene and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection act independently in the pathogenesis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). The prevalence of both risk factors varies greatly in different parts of the world. PCT patients from Hungary were evaluated to assess both factors. The prevalence of C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene was determined in 50 PCT patients and compared with the reported control frequencies. Furthermore, the presence of HCV infection was determined and related to the patients' HFE gene status. The C282Y mutation was found in 8/50 cases (three homozygotes and five heterozygotes), with an 11% allele frequency (vs. 3.8% control) (P<0.05). Seventeen patients were heterozygous, one was homozygous for the H63D mutation, allele frequency 19%, which did not differ significantly from the reported control prevalence of 12.3%. Twenty-two patients (44%) were HCV-RNA positive; six out of them were heterozygous for H63D mutation, one only for the C282Y mutation and one was compound heterozygous for both mutations. HCV infection and HFE C282Y mutation may probably be independent predisposing factors for development of PCT in Hungarian patients.	15101996
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Premalignant lesions and hepatocellular carcinoma in a non-cirrhotic alcoholic patient with iron overload and normal transferrin saturation.	Journal of hepatology	1999	10.59	A 66-year-old white man had a hepatic resection for a 6-cm well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma which had developed in a non-cirrhotic liver. The only risk factors found were heavy drinking, smoking and heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. The liver was mildly fibrotic and overloaded with iron. It also contained numerous iron-free hepatocellular lesions from <1 to 10 mm, suggesting a premalignant change. These lesions were of three types: (i) iron-free foci, (ii) hyperplastic nodules and (iii) dysplastic nodules with severe dysplasia or even foci of well-differentiated grade I hepatocellular carcinoma. This observation suggests the possibility of malignant transformation of the liver in the newly-described syndrome of iron overload and normal transferrin saturation. It also illustrates the multistep process of carcinogenesis in the non-cirrhotic liver.	10068114
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A rapid automated SSCP multiplex capillary electrophoresis protocol that detects the two common mutations implicated in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH).	Human genetics	1999	5.14	Currently two mutations in the HFE gene are known to be associated with the manifestation of the autosomal recessive disorder hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). A single-base mutation resulting in Cys282Tyr appears to have a causative role in the development of the disease, and a point mutation resulting in His63Asp may also be involved. Recent observations with a fully automated capillary electrophoresis (CE) system (ABI Prism 310) suggested that this instrument could be used for the precise identification of known mutations based on single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Two DNA fragments, each specific for one of the HFE mutation sites and labeled with a different fluorophor, were coamplified and without further manipulation simultaneously analyzed by CE-SSCP. Wild-type samples showed a mobility pattern that was clearly distinguishable from homozygous Cys282Tyr, homozygous His63Asp, or a compound heterozygous sample. To evaluate the reliability of this system for the detection of both mutations, 20 samples were analyzed blind. All genotypes, which were called automatically, were in concordance with those obtained by a previously validated restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Thus, SSCP in combination with CE provides a fast and precise research tool for the simultaneous identification of the two common mutations implicated in HH.	10071189
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetics of hemochromatosis.	Annual review of medicine	1999	10.95	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is a common autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism that results in progressive iron overload and can be fatal if untreated. The hemochromatosis gene (HFE) was identified by positional cloning in 1996. Two missense mutations have been described in HFE. The majority of HHC patients are homozygous for a cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution (C282Y); however, a small number are homozygous for a histidine-to-aspartic-acid substitution (H63D) or are heterozygous for both of these mutations. Mechanisms by which C282Y and H63D may disrupt the normal functioning of HFE have been suggested, but the role of HFE in the process of normal iron metabolism has yet to be clearly defined.	10073265
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Estimated analytic validity of HFE C282Y mutation testing in population screening: the potential value of confirmatory testing.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics		7.71	The purpose of this study was to estimate analytic sensitivity and specificity of HFE testing for C282Y homozygosity in the hypothetical setting of population screening for hemochromatosis. We analyzed published results of the Molecular Genetics Survey performed by the American College of Medical Genetics/College of American Pathologists between 1998 and 2002, taking into account its educational nature. Analytic sensitivity for C282Y homozygosity is 98.4% (95% CI 95.9%-99.5%). The analytic specificity is 99.8% (99.4%-99.9%). At a frequency of 40 per 10,000 for the homozygous genotype, the analytic positive predictive value is 66%. HFE testing for C282Y homozygosity is highly reliable. Homozygosity is uncommon in population screening, however, and confirmatory testing should be considered.	14614395
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis subjects as allogeneic blood donors: a prospective study.	Transfusion	2003	3.04	Persons with hemochromatosis constitute a plentiful and willing source of blood for transfusion. A program was established and evaluated for treating persons with hemochromatosis in a donor center and making their blood available for transfusion. Phlebotomy therapy was performed free of charge regardless of whether subjects met criteria for allogeneic donation. A Hb level of 12.5 g per dL was used as the threshold for performing phlebotomy, and decreases in the MCV were used to guide the endpoints of therapy. A total of 130 subjects were consecutively enrolled: 74 percent were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, 76 percent met eligibility criteria for allogeneic donation, and 55 percent were previous blood donors. A median of 20 weekly or biweekly phlebotomies (range, 7-99) were performed before the MCV reached the targeted endpoint of 3 percent below baseline, at which time the ferritin level was less than 30 microg per L and the transferrin saturation was less than 30 percent. The median phlebotomy interval necessary to keep the MCV at this level during maintenance therapy was 10 weeks. No incident seroconversions for agents of transfusion-transmissible disease occurred during 1402 donations. All subjects testing positive for viral agents gave a prior history of deferrable risk. Twenty-seven months after starting the program, hemochromatosis donors were contributing 14 percent of the RBC units collected for allogeneic use. Hemochromatosis subjects can safely and significantly augment the allogeneic blood supply. Provision of phlebotomy therapy unrestricted by considerations of cost or suitability for donation can improve access to care and remove incentives for incomplete risk disclosure.	14617312
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A hemochromatosis-causing mutation C282Y is a risk factor for proliferative diabetic retinopathy in Caucasians with type 2 diabetes.	Journal of human genetics	2003	2.49	Iron metabolism might be involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. C282Y and H63D mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene are associated with increased serum iron levels and consequently with hereditary hemochromatosis. In the present study, we searched for a relationship between C282Y and H63D gene mutations and the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy in Caucasians with type 2 diabetes. For this purpose, 90 subjects with type 2 diabetes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) were compared to 133 diabetic subjects without PDR. There was a significantly higher frequency of the C282Y heterozygotes in patients with PDR compared to subjects without it (OR=3.0, 95% CI=1.2-8.0; p=0.02), whereas no association was demonstrated between PDR and H63D genotypes (OR=1.1, 95% CI=0.6-2.2; p=0.7). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the C282Y mutation was a significant independent risk factor for the development of PDR (OR=6.1, 95% CI=1.2-30.5; p=0.027). These data suggest that heterozygosity for C282Y might be a novel risk factor for PDR in Caucasians with type 2 diabetes.	14618419
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased DMT1 but not IREG1 or HFE mRNA following iron depletion therapy in hereditary haemochromatosis.	Gut	2004	14.92	While upregulation of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and iron regulated gene 1 (IREG1) within duodenal enterocytes is reported in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH), these findings are controversial. Furthermore, the effect of HFE, the gene mutated in HH, on expression of these molecules is unclear. This study examines duodenal expression of these three molecules in HH patients (prior to and following phlebotomy), in patients with iron deficiency (ID), and in controls. DMT1, IREG1, and HFE mRNA were measured in duodenal tissue of C282Y homozygous HH patients, in ID patients negative for the C282Y mutation with a serum ferritin concentration less than 20 microg/l, and in controls negative for C282Y and H63D mutations with normal iron indices, using real time polymerase chain reaction. DMT1 and IREG1 mRNA levels were not significantly different in non-phlebotomised (untreated) HH patients compared with controls. DMT1 expression was significantly increased in HH patients who had undergone phlebotomy therapy (treated) and in patients with ID compared with controls. IREG1 was significantly increased in ID patients relative to controls, and while IREG1 expression was 1.8-fold greater in treated HH patients, this was not statistically significant. HFE mRNA expression was not significantly different in any of the groups investigated relative to controls. These findings demonstrate that untreated HH patients do not have increased duodenal DMT1 and IREG mRNA, but rather phlebotomy increases expression of these molecules, reflecting the effect of phlebotomy induced erythropoiesis. Finally, HFE appears to play a minor role in the regulation of iron absorption by the duodenal enterocyte.	15247188
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The recently identified type 2A juvenile haemochromatosis gene (HJV), a second candidate modifier of the C282Y homozygous phenotype.	Human molecular genetics	2004	5.99	The most common form of hereditary haemochromatosis is an adult-onset condition usually associated with the HFE C282Y/C282Y genotype. The phenotypic expression of this genotype is heterogeneous and depends on a complex interplay of genetic and non-genetic factors. The aim of the present study was to determine if mutations in the recently identified HJV gene were associated with more severe iron overload phenotypes in C282Y homozygous patients. From a cohort of 310 C282Y homozygous patients, we found nine (six males and three females) with an additional HJV missense mutation in the heterozygous state (S105L, E302K, N372D, R335Q or the previously described L101P and G320V). The iron indices of eight patients appeared to be more severe than those observed in C282Y homozygous patients of identical sex and similar age ranges. The mean serum ferritin concentration of the six males with an HJV mutation was significantly higher than that of C282Y homozygous males without an additional mutation [2350.3 (sigma=1429.9) versus 1227.2 (sigma=1130.1) microg/l; P=0.0233, Student's t-test]. We have recently reported that mutations in the gene that encodes hepcidin (HAMP) could explain one part of the C282Y/C282Y-related phenotypic heterogeneity by accentuating the iron burden. Our new data reveal that mutations in the HJV gene could be associated with a similar effect. Taken together, these results emphasize that a search for modifier genes could enable us to more precisely distinguish those C282Y homozygous patients with a higher risk to develop a severe iron overload and, consequently, clinical complications.	15254010
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Does bilirubin protect against hemochromatosis gene (HFE) related mortality?	American journal of medical genetics. Part A	2004	0.5	Serum bilirubin is an important antioxidant that is found at increased levels in hereditary hemochromatosis patients. We hypothesized that increased levels of serum bilirubin may play a protective role against oxidative stress induced by iron overload in carriers of mutations in the hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE). We studied the relation between serum total bilirubin, serum iron levels, the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations, and mortality. The study was conducted in 2,332 randomly selected subjects from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based follow-up study of people aged 55 years or over. Serum bilirubin levels were significantly correlated with serum iron (Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) = 0.4, P < 0.001), transferrin saturation (r = 0.4, P < 0.001), and serum ferritin (r = 0.2, P < 0.05). Carriers of the HFE mutations had higher levels of bilirubin compared to wild-type homozygotes. The relation was the strongest in H63D heterozygotes or homozygotes and C282Y heterozygotes. High levels of serum bilirubin were associated with a 2.8 (95% CI 0.9-8.8) fold reduction in mortality in H63D homozygotes and a 2.2 (1.0-4.7) fold reduction in mortality in C282Y heterozygotes. Taken together, our data suggest that the high levels of the antioxidant bilirubin may counteract the adverse effect of oxidative stress induced by iron overload. This may explain in part the reduced penetrance of the HFE mutations.	15266614
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Transferrin receptor 2 and HFE regulate furin expression via mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/Erk) signaling. Implications for transferrin-dependent hepcidin regulation.	Haematologica	2010	6.67	Impaired regulation of hepcidin in response to iron is the cause of genetic hemochromatosis associated with defects of HFE and transferrin receptor 2. However, the role of these proteins in the regulation of hepcidin expression is unclear. Hepcidin expression, SMAD and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) phosphorylation and furin expression were analyzed in hepatic HepG2 cells in which HFE and transferrin receptor 2 were down-regulated or expressed, or furin activity specifically inhibited. Furin expression was also analyzed in the liver of transferrin receptor 2 null mice. We showed that the silencing of HFE and transferrin receptor 2 reduced both Erk phosphorylation and furin expression, that the exogenous expression of the two enhanced the induction of phosphoErk1/2 and furin by holotransferrin, but that this did not occur when the pathogenic HFE mutant C282Y was expressed. Furin, phosphoErk1/2 and phosphoSMAD1/5/8 were down-regulated also in transferrin receptor 2-null mice. Treatment of HepG2 cells with an inhibitor of furin activity caused a strong suppression of hepcidin mRNA, probably due to the inhibition of bone morphogenic protein maturation. The data indicate that transferrin receptor 2 and HFE are involved in holotransferrin-dependent signaling for the regulation of furin which involved Erk phosphorylation. Furin in turn may control hepcidin expression.	20634490
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Identification of a new mutation on the beta-globin gene: codons 8/9 (+AGAA); GAG.AAG.TCT(Glu-Lys-Ser)>GAG. AAAGAAG, in a patient from the north of France with a phenotype of beta-thalassemia minor.	Hemoglobin	2010	0.75	A 37-year-old man presented a slight debility. The hemogram showed a phenotype of beta-thalassemia minor: Hb (13.1 g/dL), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (62 fL) with low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) (20.8 pg), associated with a high level of Hb A(2) of 5.3%. The serum ferritin level was 1,072 ng/mL. The sequencing of the mutated fragment revealed a duplication of four bases of codons 7/8 involving a shift in the open reading frame starting from codon 9 with a TGA stop codon at codon 23: codons 7/8/9 (+AGAA); GAG.AAG.TCT(Gly-Lys-Ser)>GAG.AAAGAAG. The human hemoglobin (Hb) instability tests were negative. The patient did not present the high iron Fe (HFE) mutation (C282Y, H63D). The same mutation was found in five other unrelated families (representing a total of 23 patients). All of their ancestors came from the north of France. This mutation has not been described before and could have its origins in the native populations of Northern France.	20642337

Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers	2010	1.3	The aim of this work was a haplotype analysis of the major mutations (C282Y, H63D, S65C) and IVS2(+4)t/c, IVS4(-44)t/c, and IVS5(-47)a/g polymorphisms of the hemochromatosis HFE gene in populations inhabiting the territories of Russia (Russians, Finno-Ugrians, Central Asians, and Arctic Mongoloids). The hemochromatosis gene (HFE) alleles were detected using the polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Of the eight possible intronic haplotype variants, the TTG, TTA, CTA, and CCA were identified. The HFE alleles with the different haplotype variants were distributed in an ethnospecific manner among the populations. Our finding was that every one of the C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations was in linkage disequilibrium only with one of the intronic haplotype variants: TTG, CTA, and CCA, respectively. The data from context analysis of DNA regions where the examined single-nucleotide polymorphisms are located suggested their involvement in splicing. Different genotypes of the HFE gene occur at different frequencies among populations of Russia. Carriers of the specific genotype variants may potentially express distinct sets of alternative HFE mRNAs.	20642366
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Defective bone morphogenic protein signaling underlies hepcidin deficiency in HFE hereditary hemochromatosis.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2010	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common inherited iron overload disorder. The vast majority of patients carry the missense Cys282Tyr mutation of the HFE gene. Hepcidin, the central regulator of iron homeostasis, is deficient in HH, leading to unchecked iron absorption and subsequent iron overload. The bone morphogenic protein (BMP)/small mothers against decapentaplegic (Smad) signaling cascade is central to the regulation of hepcidin. Recent data from HH mice models indicate that this pathway may be defective in the absence of the HFE protein. Hepatic BMP/Smad signaling has not been characterized in a human HFE-HH cohort to date. Hepatic expression of BMP/Smad-related genes was examined in 20 HFE-HH males with significant iron overload, and compared to seven male HFE wild-type controls using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Hepatic expression of BMP6 was appropriately elevated in HFE-HH compared to controls (P = 0.02), likely related to iron overload. Despite this, no increased expression of the BMP target genes hepcidin and Id1 was observed, and diminished phosphorylation of Smad1/Smad5/Smad8 protein relative to iron burden was found upon immunohistochemical analysis, suggesting that impaired BMP signaling occurs in HFE-HH. Furthermore, Smad6 and Smad7, inhibitors of BMP signaling, were up-regulated in HFE-HH compared to controls (P = 0.001 and P = 0.018, respectively). New data arising from this study suggest that impaired BMP signaling underlies the hepcidin deficiency of HFE-HH. Moreover, the inhibitory Smads, Smad6, and Smad7 are identified as potential disruptors of this signal and, hence, contributors to the pathogenesis of this disease.	20658468
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene variants modify the association between maternal lead burden and infant birthweight: a prospective birth cohort study in Mexico City, Mexico.	Environmental health : a global access science source	2010	3.45	Neonatal growth is a complex process involving genetic and environmental factors. Polymorphisms in the hemochromatosis (HFE) iron regulatory genes have been shown to modify transport and toxicity of lead which is known to affect birth weight. We investigated the role of HFE C282Y, HFE H63 D, and transferrin (TF) P570 S gene variants in modifying the association of lead and infant birthweight in a cohort of Mexican mother-infant pairs. Subjects were initially recruited between 1994-1995 from three maternity hospitals in Mexico City and 411 infants/565 mothers had archived blood available for genotyping. Multiple linear regression models, stratified by either maternal/infant HFE or TF genotype and then combined with interaction terms, were constructed examining the association of lead and birthweight after controlling for covariates. 3.1%, 16.8% and 17.5% of infants (N=390) and 1.9%, 14.5% and 18.9% of mothers (N=533) carried the HFE C282Y, HFE H63D, and TF P570 S variants, respectively. The presence of infant HFE H63 D variants predicted 110.3 g (95% CI -216.1, -4.6) decreases in birthweight while maternal HFE H63 D variants predicted reductions of 52.0 g (95% CI -147.3 to 43.2). Interaction models suggest that both maternal and infant HFE H63 D genotype may modify tibia lead's effect on infant birthweight in opposing ways. In our interaction models, maternal HFE H63 D variant carriers had a negative association between tibia lead and birthweight. These results suggest that the HFE H63 D genotype modifies lead's effects on infant birthweight in a complex fashion that may reflect maternal-fetal interactions with respect to the metabolism and transport of metals.	20659343
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Relation of HFE gene mutations, high iron stores and early onset coronary artery disease.	The Canadian journal of cardiology	1998	0.5	To determine the impact of mutations in the HFE gene (human leukocyte antigen H) on predisposition to coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients not diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis. Elevated iron stores can predispose to acute myocardial infarction. Two mutations (C282Y and H63D) in the novel major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 gene HFE were found in most patients with hereditary hemochromatosis causing high iron stores. The effect of these mutations on predisposition to CAD has not been investigated previously. Three hundred patients with a history of myocardial infarction or angina pectoris and angiographically documented CAD were studied. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (150 patients), manifesting early onset CAD and presenting with these findings under age 50 years; and group 2 (150 patients), presenting for the first time over age 65 years. Prevalence of the C282Y and H63D mutations was assessed by molecular analysis, and plasma ferritin was measured immunochemically. There was no difference in the prevalence of homozygous, heterozygous or compound heterozygous (C282Y/H63D) states between the groups. Males in group 1 had higher plasma ferritin than those in group 2 (234 +/- 174 micrograms/L versus 136 +/- 103 micrograms/L, P < 0.0001), but this was not significantly different in females (75 +/- 54 micrograms/L versus 92 +/- 73 micrograms/L, P = 0.26). Ferritin remained higher in group 1 than in group 2 males after exclusion of mutation carriers (195 +/- 121 micrograms/L versus 109 +/- 76 micrograms/L, respectively, P < 0.0001), but did not change in females. Higher iron stores were found in males with early onset CAD. This association was not related to the C282Y or H63D mutation in HFE. It is suggested that association of the MHC locus with delayed onset CAD is probably unrelated to HFE in these patients, and that HFE mutations are not a major risk factor in the development of high iron stores in early onset CAD.	9520858
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of HFE genotypes, C282Y and H63D, in patients with hematologic disorders.	Haematologica	2002	6.67	Iron status has implications for normal erythrocyte and leukocyte function and for platelet count, size and activation. Increased storage of iron is considered a potential risk factor participating in the pathogenesis of malignant diseases. Since HFE gene mutations have recently been implicated in unbalanced iron homeostasis, we set out to examine the prevalence of these mutations in patients with hematologic disorders. C282Y and H63D mutations were determined in 232 patients with various hematologic disorders treated at Oulu University Hospital between 1987 and 2000. DNA samples extracted from either the peripheral blood or bone marrow of these patients were amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using sequence-specific primers, and the products were analyzed on agarose gels. There was a slight tendency towards lower frequencies of the C282Y allele in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (3.8%, n=53) and higher frequencies in those with essential thrombocythemia (ET) (16.2%, n=37). Contrary to some expectations, however, the frequency of the C282Y allele in acute lymphoblastic leukemia turned out to be normal (7.0%, n=43). Our data showed no significant deviations in H63D mutation frequency in any of the categories of patients. Our results do not show any significant association between HFE gene mutations and hematologic malignancies. The divergent frequencies observed for the C282Y mutation in patients with AML and ET highlight the need for larger population studies of HFE mutations in patients with hematologic diseases.	11836162

Haematologica	2002	6.67	We analyzed the hepcidin gene in 10 Italian patients with hemochromatosis not related to C282Y, H63D or other less frequent HFE mutations, nor to Y250X in TFR2. The sequencing of the whole hepcidin coding region, intron-exon junctions, 5' and partially 3'UTRs, did not reveal any alteration in the studied patients.	11836175
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations analysis in Basque hereditary haemochromatosis patients and controls.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2001	4.58	C282Y/C282Y genotype is the prevalent genotype in Hereditary Haemochromatosis (HH), however, other genotypes have been associated with the disease. The objective of our study was to analyse the frequency of the three main mutations of HFE gene in HH patients and controls from the Basque population with differential genetic characteristics. Thirty five HH patients and 116 controls were screened for C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations using a PCR-RFLP technique. The association of HLA-A and-B alleles and HFE mutations was also studied in Basque controls. The frequency of C282Y homozygotes in the group of patients was only 57%. The rest of the patients presented heterogeneous genotypes, including compound heterozygotes: 11% of them were C282Y/H63D; and 2.85% were H63D/S65C. H63D or S65C heterozygotes had a frequency of 11% and 2.85 respectively and 5.71% patients lacked any mutation The high frequency of H63D in the healthy Basque population is confirmed in this study. A considerable incidence of S65C is observed either in controls and in HH (3%) or in iron overloaded patients. The peculiar genetic characteristics of Basques could explain the heterogeneity of genotypes in HH patients of this group. Further studies should be carried out to confirm these findings although the implication of other genetic or external factors in the development of HH is suggested.	11840200
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Phenotypic expression of a novel C282Y/R226G compound heterozygous state in HFE hemochromatosis: molecular dynamics and biochemical studies.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2014	0.5	Most adults affected with hereditary hemochromatosis are homozygous for a single point mutation of HFE (p.Cys282Tyr). Apart from the compound heterozygous state for the p.Cys282Tyr mutant and the widespread p.His63Asp variant allele, other rare HFE mutations can be found in trans and may have clinical impact. In the present report we describe the structural and functional consequences of a new mutation, namely the p.Arg226Gly which was inherited in trans with the p.Cys282Tyr allele in a patient affected with a mild iron overload. Because the R226G substitution is located in the vicinity of the normal Cys225S-S282Cys disulfide bond we initially investigated the structure of the variant by molecular dynamics techniques in order to estimate the effect of the mutation on the global structure of HFE domain α3. We found that the solvation free energy, hydrophobicity and formation of salt bridges are slightly modified with the global secondary structure of the α3 domain being conserved. In a previous paper, we demonstrated that the Q283P substitution leads to the loss of the normal Cys225S-S282Cys disulfide bridge. Similar to the Q283P substitution, the R226G substitution does not substitute a residue directly involved in the formation of the disulfide bridge. However, unlike the p.Gln283Pro variant which destroyed the normal disulfide bridge, the R226G mutation does not affect the normal Cys225S-S282Cys bridge. Furthermore based on cell line studies we clearly show that the mutation does not prevent cell surface localization, β2-microglobulin association and binding to transferrin receptor 1. This new compound heterozygous phenotype is very close to those of the C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous patients who display the biochemical hemochromatosis phenotype but with lower body iron stores than C282Y homozygotes. Our results do not exclude unknown genetic and/or metabolic factors that may act synergistically to increase the ferritin level.	23953397
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Dupuytren's Contracture in Alabama HFE Hemochromatosis Probands.	Clinical medicine insights. Arthritis and musculoskeletal disorders	2012	0.5	Dupuytren's contracture (DC) and HFE hemochromatosis occur in some of the same at-risk populations and present with similar comorbid conditions. We estimated DC prevalence in two cohorts of white Alabama hemochromatosis probands (294 C282Y homozygotes, 67 C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes) in a retrospective study. We performed logistic regressions on DC using the following independent variables: age, body mass index, heavy ethanol consumption, serum ferritin, elevated serum AST/ALT, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and diabetes. One man and two women with C282Y homozygosity had DC (prevalence 1.02%; 95% CI 0.35%-2.96%). A man with C282Y/H63D had DC (prevalence 1.49%; 95% CI 0.26%-7.98%). DC occurred as an autosomal dominant trait in his kinship. In regression analyses, no single variable predicted DC. We observed no new DC cases after the diagnosis of hemochromatosis (mean follow-up 12.9 ± 7.5 years (1 SD), and 9.0 ± 5.1 years, respectively). Our prevalence estimates of DC in white Alabama hemochromatosis probands are similar to those found in the white US population cohorts. DC risk was unrelated to the variables we studied.	22952417
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Phenotypic and clinical manifestations of compound heterozygous genetic haemochromatosis (CHGH): a non-invasive approach to clinical management.	Internal medicine journal	2013	1.53	The role of compound heterozygous genetic haemochromatosis (CHGH) (C282Y/H63D) mutations in the manifestations of iron overload is known; however, the extent of these manifestations and their associated management remain unclear. This study evaluates the phenotypic manifestations of CHGH using laboratory and radiological biomarkers including serum ferritin/transferrin saturation, liver function tests (LFT), thyroid function tests, blood sugar level, and abdominal ultrasound (US) or computed tomography. The study also evaluates the effects of venesection therapy on these markers and its potential role in routine management of CHGH patients. In this case-controlled study, 104 patients with HFE-C282Y/H63D compound mutations were subjected to laboratory investigations and imaging. Tests were repeated over a 4-year period before and after venesection. Data were compared between patient and control groups using paired t-tests. Patients showed significantly higher serum ferritin and transferrin saturations compared with controls (P = 0.002, P = 0.003). Twenty-four patients (23%) demonstrated hyperferritinaemia ≥ 1000 mmol/L. Sixty-nine patients (68%) demonstrated biochemical abnormalities on initial testing (abnormal LFT (transaminases) (51 patients, 74%) and US/computed tomography (42 patients, 61%)). A significant number of LFT and US abnormalities normalised post-venesection (80%; P = 0.000 and 52%; P = 0.005 respectively). Phenotypic manifestations displayed by CHGH patients can include biochemical and radiological abnormalities, which can occur at levels similar to C282Y homozygous disease (ferritin ≥ 1000 mmol/L). With venesection therapy, a large number of these abnormalities is reversible. Based on this, a non-invasive framework to assess and manage CHGH within a routine community-based clinical setting is proposed.	22957807
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron storage disease in Asia-Pacific populations: the importance of non-HFE mutations.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2013	3.32	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a widely recognized and well-studied condition in European populations. This is largely due to the high prevalence of the C282Y mutation of HFE. Although less common than in Europe, HH cases have been reported in the Asia-Pacific region because of mutations in both HFE and non-HFE genes. Mutations in all of the currently known genes implicated in non-HFE HH (hemojuvelin, hepcidin, transferrin receptor 2, and ferroportin) have been reported in patients from the Asia-Pacific region. This review discusses the molecular basis of HH and the genes and mutations known to cause non-HFE HH with particular reference to the Asia-Pacific region. Challenges in the genetic diagnosis of non-HFE HH are also discussed and how new technologies such as next generation sequencing may be informative in the future.	23577916
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE based re-evaluation of heterozygous hemochromatosis.	American journal of medical genetics	2002	0.5	Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is strongly associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. More than one subject out of 10 in the general population is a heterozygote for the C282Y mutation. In this study, we address whether or not conclusions drawn from HLA-based family studies regarding the expression of heterozygous hemochromatosis are applicable to C282Y heterozygotes. The correlation between HLA-inferred and HFE genotypes and the variation of serum iron tests according to HFE genotype and other factors were studied in persons from well-characterized hemochromatosis pedigrees. Subjects were tested for both C282Y and H63D mutations. The following factors were studied: age, sex, alcohol consumption, body mass index, liver function tests, serum lipids and glucose, serum iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin. HLA-inferred heterozygotes were C282Y heterozygotes in only 70% and compound heterozygotes (i.e., heterozygotes for both C282Y and H63D) in 20%. C282Y heterozygotes did not differ from wild type homozygotes in terms of serum iron tests. Only compound heterozygotes presented with slightly increased transferrin saturation. On the other hand, increased serum ferritin was strongly associated with overweight or lipidic or glucose abnormalities. C282Y heterozygotes selected from family studies do not have greater serum iron tests than wild type homozygotes, except for compound heterozygotes, and therefore should not require special followup. The discovery of abnormal iron tests in a C282Y heterozygote should lead to workup for other causes of iron overload.	12210292
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis: genetics helps to define a multifactorial disease.	Clinical genetics	1998	3.89	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder that can result in iron overload and a wide range of clinical complications, including hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, hypopituitarism, hypogonadism, arthritis, and cardiomyopathy. People with HH can be detected at an asymptomatic stage of the disease by abnormalities in serum iron measures. Early detection is desirable, because periodic phlebotomy provides effective treatment for iron overload and may prevent complications of the disorder. The natural history of HH is poorly understood, however, and the proportion of people detected by screening who will develop serious complications of HH is unknown. The genetics of HH may help to resolve these questions. The gene, HFE, and two mutations, C282Y and H63D, have been identified: the C282Y mutation has a higher penetrance than the H63D mutation, and appears to result in a greater loss of HFE protein function. Most people with HH are C282Y homozygotes, a small proportion are compound heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes, and some have no identifiable HFE mutation or are HFE heterozygotes, suggesting that additional mutations associated with HH are yet to be found. Gender and environmental agents, such as alcohol and dietary iron, influence phenotypic expression of HH. The severity of HH is thus determined by an interaction between genotype and modifying factors. HFE mutations also appear to increase the likelihood of iron overload in inherited anemias and to promote the clinical manifestations of porphyria cutanea tarda. HH is an important paradigm for medical genetics because it offers an opportunity to explore the complexity of gene gene and gene environment interactions.	9727731

British journal of haematology	1998	5.4	It has been proposed that iron accumulation may contribute to atherogenesis by increasing free radical formation and oxidative stress. Epidemiological studies in which the association of iron status with atherosclerosis was assessed raised conflicting results. To test whether genetic haemochromatosis is associated with increased atherosclerosis, we determined the prevalence of two mutations in the HFE gene related to haemochromatosis (845G-->A; Cys282Tyr. and 187 C-->G, His63Asp) in 265 consecutive patients with premature (<50 years of age) angiographically-proven atherosclerotic disease (coronary and/or peripheral), and in 272 healthy controls. PCR amplification followed by RsaI (Cys282Tyr analysis) and BclI (His63Asp analysis) restriction digestion was employed to define the genotypes. The mutant Cys282Tyr allele had a frequency of 0.07 among controls and 0.04 among patients (carrier frequency of 14.0% and 8.3%, respectively). The frequency of the His63Asp mutant allele was 0.14 (28.6% of carriers) in controls and 0.11 (22.2% of carriers) in patients. Five of 265 patients (1.1%) and 9/272 controls (3.3%) were compound heterozygotes. In conclusion, a lower prevalence of the Cys 282Tyr mutation and a similar frequency of the His63Asp mutation was observed in patients with atherosclerotic disease in comparison with normal controls. These findings do not support an association between haemochromatosis and atherogenesis.	9753040
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Is there a link between African iron overload and the described mutations of the hereditary haemochromatosis gene?	British journal of haematology	1998	5.4	Over 80%, of Caucasian patients with hereditary haemochromatosis are homozygotes for a C282Y mutation in the HFE gene on chromosome 6. Recent evidence suggests that a genetic factor may also be involved in the pathogenesis of African iron overload, although the locus has not been described. PCR analysis of DNA from 25 southern Africans, identified by segregation analysis as having a high probability of carrying the putative African iron-loading gene, failed to identify any subjects with the C282Y mutation. The possible genetic defect in African iron overload appears to be different from that described in most cases of hereditary haemochromatosis in Caucasians.	9753041
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Aetiology of severe iron overload in a family with hereditary haemolytic anaemia.	British journal of haematology	1998	5.4	Severe iron overload is a reported complication of certain erythroid disorders which are characterized by increased erythropoietic activity. Proposed mechanisms include enhancement of iron absorption secondary to increased erythroid activity and coexistent heterozygosity or homozygosity for haemochromatosis. We performed PCR-based analysis for the haemochromatosis-related HFE C282Y mutation in an extended family with inherited haemolytic anaemia in which several members exhibited iron overload. The results demonstrated iron overload was associated with homozygosity but not heterozygosity for this mutation. Such an association may also exist in other erythroid disorders in which iron overload has been reported.	9753042
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	A missense mutation (I278T) in the cystathionine beta-synthase gene prevalent in pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria and associated with mild clinical phenotype.	American journal of human genetics	1995	10.79	Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by homocystinuria and multisystem clinical disease. Patients responsive to pyridoxine usually have a milder clinical phenotype than do nonresponsive patients, and we studied the molecular pathology of this disorder in an attempt to understand the molecular basis of the clinical variation. We previously reported a T833C transition in exon 8 causing a substitution of threonine for isoleucine at codon 278 (I278T). By PCR amplification and sequencing of exon 8 from genomic DNA we have now detected the I278T mutation in 7 of 11 patients with in vivo pyridoxine responsiveness and in 0 of 27 pyridoxine-nonresponsive patients. Two pyridoxine-responsive patients are homozygous and five are heterozygous for I278T. We have now observed the I278T mutation in 41% (9 of 22) of the independent alleles in pyridoxine-responsive patients of varied ethnic backgrounds. In two of the compound heterozygotes we identified a novel mutation (G139R and E144K) in the other allele. The finding that the two patients who are homozygous for I278T have only ectopia lentis and mild bone demineralization suggests that this mutation is associated with both in vivo pyridoxine responsiveness and mild clinical disease. Compound heterozygous patients who have one copy of this missense mutation are likely to retain some degree of pyridoxine responsiveness.	7611293
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Exome sequencing for molecular characterization of non-HFE hereditary hemochromatosis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2015	0.5	Diagnostic genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis is readily available for clinically relevant HFE variants (i.e., those that generate the C282Y, H63D and S65C HFE polymorphisms); however, genetic testing for other known causes of iron overload, including mutations affecting genes encoding hemojuvelin, transferrin receptor 2, HAMP, and ferroportin is not. As an alternative to conventional genetic testing we propose diagnostic use of whole exome sequencing for characterization of non-HFE hemochromatosis. To illustrate the effectiveness of whole exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool, we present the case of an 18-year-old female with a probable case of juvenile hemochromatosis, who was referred for specialty care after testing negative for commonly occurring HFE variants. Whole exome sequencing offered complete coverage of target genes and is a fast, cost effective diagnostic tool for characterization of non-HFE hemochromatosis.	26142323
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Expression of mutant human cystathionine beta-synthase rescues neonatal lethality but not homocystinuria in a mouse model.	Human molecular genetics	2005	5.99	Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a recessive genetic disorder in humans characterized by elevated levels of total plasma homocysteine (tHcy) and frequent thrombosis in humans. The I278T mutation is the most common mutation found in human CBS-deficient patients. The T424N mutation was identified as a mutation in human CBS that could restore function to I278T in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this report, we have engineered mice that express human I278T and I278T/T424N proteins from a metallotheinein-driven transgene. These transgene-containing mice were then bred to CBS knockout animals (Cbs-) to generate mice that express only human I278T or I278T/T424N protein. Both the I278T and the I278T/T424N transgenes are able to entirely rescue the previously described neonatal mortality phenotype despite the animals having a mean tHcy of 250 microm. The transgenic Cbs-/- animals exhibit facial alopecia, have moderate liver steatosis and are slightly smaller than heterozygous littermates. In contrast to human CBS deficiency, these mice do not exhibit extreme methioninemia. The mutant proteins are stable in the liver, kidney and colon, and liver extracts have only 2-3% of the CBS enzyme activity found in wild-type mice. Surprisingly, the I278T/T424N enzyme had exactly the same activity as the I278T enzyme indicating that T424N is unable to suppress I278T in mice. Our results show that elevated tHcy per se is not responsible for the neonatal lethality observed in Cbs-/- animals and suggests that CBS protein may have a function in addition to its role in homocysteine catabolism. These transgenic animals should be useful in the study of homocysteine related human disease.	15972722
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency and clinical expression of HFE gene mutations in a Spanish population of subjects with abnormal iron metabolism.	Annals of hematology	2005	3.02	Three HFE gene mutations (HFE 845 G-->A, 187 C-->G and 193 A-->T) are the most common mutations related to hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). The genotype for these mutations was analysed in 359 Spanish individuals with altered iron metabolism and iron overload. Various biochemical parameters were measured in serum samples from 96 of these individuals, and the effect of the genotype on these parameters was studied. Allele frequencies were 12.95% for the HFE C282Y variant, 28.97% for the HFE H63D variant and 0.69% for the HFE S65C variant, calculated in a total of 718 chromosomes. Multiple comparisons analysis showed very significant differences (p=0.001) in transferrin saturation index (TSI) between the HFE C282Y variant homozygous and control (ten healthy volunteers) groups. Highly significant (p=0.0001) and significant (p=0.005) differences in serum ferritin values were found between the HFE C282Y variant homozygous and control groups and between compound (HFE C282Y/H63D variant) heterozygous and control groups, respectively. Very significant differences (p=0.001) in serum iron values were observed between the HFE C282Y variant homozygous and control groups. TSI and serum ferritin values detected most HFE C282Y variant homozygotes and are recommended to facilitate the clinical diagnosis of HH.	15986199
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis-causing mutations C282Y and H63D are not risk factors for atherothrombotic cerebral infarction.	Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research	2005	1.4	It has been suggested that iron metabolism may be involved in the pathogenesis of atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (ACI). The C282Y and H63D mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene are associated with increased serum iron levels and net iron accumulation. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene are risk factors for ACI in a Slovene population. The C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations were tested in 96 Caucasian patients who had suffered an acute cerebral infarction, later confirmed as ACI, and 115 control subjects. Genotypes were determined by electrophoresis of the DNA digestion products from RsaI (C282Y) and MboI (H63D). We failed to demonstrate that the C282Y and H63D mutations were risk factors for ACI in Caucasians. The percentage of C282Y and H63D genotypes (dominant model) in ACI-cases (C282Y: 7.3%, n=7; H63D: 28.1%, n=27) did not differ significantly (P=0.9 and P=0.7 respectively) from that of the controls (C282Y: 7.0%, n=8; H63D: 26.1%, n=30). Logistic regression analysis revealed that arterial hypertension, diabetes, and cigarette smoking are independent risk factors for ACI, whereas the C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations are not. We provided evidence that the C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations were not risk factors for ACI in this Slovene population.	15990686
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of HFE mutations and relation to serum iron status in patients with chronic hepatitis C and patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in Taiwan.	World journal of gastroenterology	2005	2.79	To assess the prevalence of the two mutations, C282Y and H63D of HFE gene, in healthy subjects, patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), and patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in Taiwan and to explore the contribution of the HFE mutation on serum iron stores in CHC and NAFLD groups. We examined C282Y and H63D mutations of HFE gene in 125 healthy subjects, 29 patients with CHC, and 33 patients with NAFLD. The serum iron markers, including ferritin, iron, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC), were assessed in all patients. All of the healthy subjects and patients were free from C282Y mutation. The prevalence of H63D heter-ozygosity was 4/125 (3.20%) in healthy subjects, 2/29 (6.90%) in CHC group, and 1/33 (3.03%) in NAFLD group. The healthy subjects showed no significant difference in the prevalence of H63D mutation as compared with the CHC or NAFLD group. Increased serum iron store was found in 34.48% of CHC patients and 36.36% of NAFLD patients. In three patients of H63D heterozygosity, only one CHC patient had increased serum iron store. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of HFE mutations between patients with increased serum iron store and those without in CHC or NAFLD group. The HFE mutations may not contribute to iron accumulation in the CHC or NAFLD group even when serum iron overload is observed in more than one-third of these patients in Taiwan.	15991291
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Beware of multiple comparisons: a study of symptoms associated with mutations of the HFE hemochromatosis gene.	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	2005	0.5	Studies involving a large number of comparisons have a high likelihood of finding statistically significant associations by chance alone (Type 1 error). Genetic association studies are particularly prone to this pitfall. We tested the effect of multiple comparisons in a study of symptoms among subjects genotyped for mutations of the HFE hemochromatosis gene. Two randomly selected groups were created from a dataset of 30,917 white adult subjects genotyped for the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. Frequency of symptoms among subjects with different HFE genotypes was compared to sex-matched wild type controls in Random Group 1 (hypothesis generation). Statistically significant associations (p<0.05 by chi2) were then tested in Random Group 2 (hypothesis testing). A total of 101/1765 associations in men and 116/2015 associations in women were statistically significant in Random Group 1. Of these, 12 associations in men and 13 associations in women were also statistically significant in Random Group 2, 11 of which were specific to hemochromatosis. None of the remaining 14 associations (6 in men and 8 in women) involved symptoms with a biologically plausible relationship to hemochromatosis or iron overload. Genetic association studies should be scrutinized for the possibility of Type 1 error.	15993396
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Molecular analysis of homocystinuria in Brazilian patients.	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	2005	0.5	Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is the most common cause of homocystinuria. However, no data are available concerning the molecular basis of this disease in Brazilian populations. We studied 14 Brazilian patients from 11 unrelated families using a combined screening approach, involving restriction analysis, single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) scanning, and sequencing. All patients presented homocysteine levels higher than 200 mumol/l before the beginning of treatment. The most common CBS gene mutations, p.G307S (c.919G > A) and p.I278T (c.833T > C), were evaluated and the allele c.919A was not found. One allele with the c.844 ins68 (4.5%) in the CBS gene was found. Three families (6 patients) presented the allele c.833 C (13.6%), without the insertion in the heterozygous state. SSCP scanning and sequencing showed 3 alleles p.T191M (13.64%) in 2 families. One allele with a novel mutation was found in exon 4 (c.168T > A) of the CBS gene (4.5%). We also analyzed c.677C > T and c.1298A > C polymorphisms in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and the 2756A > G polymorphism in the methionine synthase (MTR) gene. The frequencies of mutated alleles were: 50% c.677T and 18.2% c.1298C for MTHFR, and 27.3% c.2756G for MTR. In spite of the high level of racial mixing in the country, Brazilian homocystinuric patients did not present a high prevalence of the most common mutations described in the literature.	15993874
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutation analysis of the HFE gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis in a Venezuelan sample.	Annals of hematology	2005	3.02	The frequency of the C282Y, H63D and S65C alleles of the HFE gene was determined in a sample of the Venezuelan population. Two new sets of primers were tested for amplifying the regions mapping these mutations, and genotyping was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). DNA sequencing was used to validate the RFLP analysis. Serum ferritin levels were also determined. Two hundred and fourteen individuals were tested, extracting DNA from whole blood cells (n=177) or from serum (n=37). The frequency of heterozygous subjects was 3.7, 18.2 and 1.7% for the C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations, respectively, and the allele frequencies were 0.019+/-0.01 for C282Y, 0.119+/-0.016 for H63D and 0.009+/-0.005 for S65C. The results suggest that the admixture of native populations with subjects of South European origin might have had an important role in the diffusion of HFE alleles in Venezuela. C282Y homozygous subjects were not found in this study. No HFE genotype studied here was associated with a significant elevation of serum ferritin concentrations, except for C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote found in one asymptomatic male. This finding supports the theory that the H63D mutation could be involved in alterations of iron parameters when inherited together with C282Y. Our results indicate that C282Y homozygotes will be rarely detected. Performance of HFE mutation analysis in individuals with high iron determinations would be recommended.	15995871
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	CYBRD1 as a modifier gene that modulates iron phenotype in HFE p.C282Y homozygous patients.	Haematologica	2012	6.67	Most patients with hereditary hemochromatosis in the Caucasian population are homozygous for the p.C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. The penetrance and expression of hereditary hemochromatosis differ largely among cases of homozygous p.C282Y. Genetic factors might be involved in addition to environmental factors. In the present study, we analyzed 50 candidate genes involved in iron metabolism and evaluated the association between 214 single nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes and three phenotypic outcomes of iron overload (serum ferritin, iron removed and transferrin saturation) in a large group of 296 p.C282Y homozygous Italians. Polymorphisms were tested for genetic association with each single outcome using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex and alcohol consumption. We found a series of 17 genetic variants located in different genes with possible additive effects on the studied outcomes. In order to evaluate whether the selected polymorphisms could provide a predictive signature for adverse phenotype, we re-evaluated data by dividing patients in two extreme phenotype classes based on the three phenotypic outcomes. We found that only a small improvement in prediction could be achieved by adding genetic information to clinical data. Among the selected polymorphisms, a significant association was observed between rs3806562, located in the 5'UTR of CYBRD1, and transferrin saturation. This variant belongs to the same haplotype block that contains the CYBRD1 polymorphism rs884409, found to be associated with serum ferritin in another population of p.C282Y homozygotes, and able to modulate promoter activity. A luciferase assay indicated that rs3806562 does not have a significant functional role, suggesting that it is a genetic marker linked to the putative genetic modifier rs884409. While our results support the hypothesis that polymorphisms in genes regulating iron metabolism may modulate penetrance of HFE-hereditary hemochromatosis, with emphasis on CYBRD1, they strengthen the notion that none of these polymorphisms alone is a major modifier of the phenotype of hereditary hemochromatosis.	22773607
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hereditary hemochromatosis, the clinician point of view].	Annales de biologie clinique		0.28	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disease whose most common form is due to homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. Its prevalence is estimated between 1/200 and 1/600 in France. This represents potentially several thousands of affected people. The disease is characterized by progressive iron overload, which can lead to irreversible parenchymal tissue damage. When clinical signs become evocative the disease is already at an advanced stage and years of life are probably lost. It is therefore important to detect the disease early. The clinician, either general practitioner or specialist, plays a pivotal role in the diagnostic process: he/she receives complaints of patients, prescribes complementary investigations, conducts the treatment and must organize of the family screening. Based on the French recommendations and on literature data, this paper presents the main lines of management of the patient as responses to the eight following questions: 1) Under what circumstances should the clinician suspect HH? 2) How to conduct investigations in the presence of high ferritin levels? 3) What manifestations must be feared with the worsening of iron overload? 4) What medical evaluation should be performed when the diagnosis of HH has been made? 5) How to conduct iron depletive treatment in practice? 6) How to monitor the treated patient? 7) What is the place of iron-chelating drugs in the treatment of HH? 8) How to take charge of the family members?	22796611
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hereditary hemochromatosis HFE: regulatory and economic aspects of diagnosis and medical management].	Annales de biologie clinique		0.28	HFE hereditary hemochromatosis is a chronic illness (ALD n(o) 17 - Maladies métaboliques et héréditaires) which is the first genetic disease in France (60% of all genetic diseases). The list of medical acts and the services supported by the French national health insurance fund are fully codified by the French national authority for health (HAS) in order to reduce unnecessary health care spending. The search for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene to confirm the diagnosis is supported by French national health insurance fund since 2007 (under certain conditions). Treatment by phlebotomy is well established. It should begin in hospital and is generally well tolerated. Since April 2009, the use of the patient's blood (phlebotomy - blood donations) in French blood centers provides an additional contribution to blood transfusion. However, if this genetic disease is well known to the scientific viewpoint (mechanism and toxicity of iron overload, gene…) and therapeutically (bleeding), the diagnosis is always made too late by ignorance of the symptoms.	22796612
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE H63D, C282Y and AGTR1 A1166C polymorphisms and brain white matter lesions in the aging brain.	Journal of neurogenetics	2011	1.85	Incidental white matter lesions (WML) are a common neuroradiological finding in elderly people and have been linked to dementia and depression. Various mechanisms including hypoxia and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in the etiology of WML. The hemochromatosis (HFE) gene p.H63D and p.C282Y polymorphisms have been linked to dysregulation of iron metabolism and increased levels of ROS, whereas Angiotensin II receptor 1 (AGTR1) c.1166A → C polymorphism is known as a vascular risk factor. These genetic polymorphisms were characterized in brains donated to the UK MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) to assess their potential role in the risk for development of age-related WML. The study cohort comprised 258 brain donated to CFAS. WML severity was assessed in the postmortem brain donations using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and scored using the Scheltens' scale. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of extracted DNA followed by restriction enzyme digestion was used to genotype the samples. Genotypes were validated using direct sequencing in a smaller sample. The results show that HFE p.H63D polymorphism is not associated with WML severity in the whole cohort. However, there is a significant association of the D allele with severity of WML in noncarriers of the APOE ε4 allele. No association is demonstrated between the HFE p.C282Y nor the AGTR1 c.1166A → C polymorphisms and WML severity. The HFE gene appears to be a genetic risk factor for severe aging WML independently of the APOE ε4 genotype. This would support the role of iron-related oxidative stress, in addition to previously studied factors, e.g., hypoxia as potential risk factors for developing prominent aging WML.	21332426
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron storage disease in red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus) is not associated with mutations in the HFE gene.	Journal of comparative pathology		1.17	Iron storage diseases are rare conditions of dysregulated iron metabolism in man and animals. A genetic basis has been confirmed only for human haemochromatosis. Iron storage disease was diagnosed in six related, 2-year-old male red deer of the same herd. These animals presented with weight loss and rough hair coats. Haematological examination was unremarkable. At necropsy examination, gross lesions were restricted to cachexia. Microscopical examination revealed severe, diffuse hepatocellular necrosis and iron accumulation in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, cardiac myocytes and renal tubular cells in all affected animals. Four animals also had moderate bridging fibrosis in the liver. Hepatic iron concentrations were increased (1108-2275 mg/kg wet weight; reference range 100-200 mg/kg). Drinking water in rusty iron tubs in the deer park contained eight times more iron than the accepted level for human drinking water. To test for a possible genetic basis of increased iron uptake and storage in red deer, the cervid haemochromatosis gene (HFE) was identified. Sequence comparisons between the six diseased animals and three healthy free-ranging unrelated animals failed to identify differences in the HFE sequences. Furthermore, the disease was not associated with common amino acid substitutions reported in human patients with haemochromatosis, including C282Y and H63D. Polymorphisms in other non-HFE genes involved in iron metabolism may have led to a higher sensitivity to iron and this, together with the high iron content of the drinking water, may have been the cause of the observed iron storage in these red deer.	21334004
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene variants affect iron in the brain.	The Journal of nutrition	2011	0.5	Iron accumulation in the brain and increased oxidative stress are consistent observations in many neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we have begun examination into gene mutations or allelic variants that could be associated with loss of iron homeostasis. One of the mechanisms leading to iron overload is a mutation in the HFE gene, which is involved in iron metabolism. The 2 most common HFE gene variants are C282Y (1.9%) and H63D (8.9%). The C282Y HFE variant is more commonly associated with hereditary hemochromatosis, which is an autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by iron overload in a number of systemic organs. The H63D HFE variant appears less frequently associated with hemochromatosis, but its role in the neurodegenerative diseases has received more attention. At the cellular level, the HFE mutant protein resulting from the H63D HFE gene variant is associated with iron dyshomeostasis, increased oxidative stress, glutamate release, tau phosphorylation, and alteration in inflammatory response, each of which is under investigation as a contributing factor to neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the HFE gene variants are proposed to be genetic modifiers or a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases by establishing an enabling milieu for pathogenic agents. This review will discuss the current knowledge of the association of the HFE gene variants with neurodegenerative diseases: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ischemic stroke. Importantly, the data herein also begin to dispel the long-held view that the brain is protected from iron accumulation associated with the HFE mutations.	21346098
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	Journal of hepatology	2011	10.59	Previous studies examining the relationship between the C282Y and H63D HFE mutations and presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have yielded conflicting results. The goal of this study was to systematically evaluate and summarize data on the association between these two variants and the presence of NAFLD. The authors searched EMBASE and PUBMED from August 1, 1996 to August 12, 2010. Two investigators independently conducted data abstraction. Ethnic specific weighted prevalence was calculated and pooled odds ratios were estimated using the random effects model. From 2542 references, the authors included 16 case-control studies and 14 case-only studies, or 2610 cases and 7298 controls. The majority of the studies came from Caucasian populations (2287 cases and 4275 controls). The weighted prevalence of HFE mutations in cases was comparable to controls. The meta-analysis was restricted to Caucasians only because of the small sample size of non Caucasian participants. The pooled odds ratio for the presence of any HFE genetic variant in cases was 1.03 (95%CI: 0.90, 1.17; I(2): 65.8%, 95%CI: 38.5, 81.0). The presence of other genotypes and secondary analyses yielded similar non significant findings. Our systematic review does not support an association between the HFE genetic variants and the presence of NAFLD.	21354231
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Use of community genetic screening to prevent HFE-associated hereditary haemochromatosis.	Lancet (London, England)		0.5	HFE-associated hereditary haemochromatosis is a recessive, iron-overload disorder that affects about one in 200 north Europeans and that can be easily prevented. However, genetic screening for this disease is controversial, and so we assessed whether such screening was suitable for communities. Cheek-brush screening for the Cys282Tyr HFE mutation was offered to individuals in the workplace. Outcomes were assessed by questionnaires before and after testing. 11,307 individuals were screened. We recorded no increase in anxiety in individuals who were homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation or non-homozygous. Self-reported tiredness before testing was significantly higher in homozygous participants than in non-homozygous participants (chi2 test, p=0.029). Of the 47 homozygous individuals identified, 46 have taken steps to treat or prevent iron accumulation. Population genetic screening for HFE-associated hereditary haemochromatosis can be practicable and acceptable.	16039334
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Total blood lymphocyte counts in hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity: relationship to severity of iron overload and HLA-A and -B alleles and haplotypes.	BMC blood disorders	2005	0.5	It has been reported that some persons with hemochromatosis have low total blood lymphocyte counts, but the reason for this is unknown. We measured total blood lymphocyte counts using an automated blood cell counter in 146 hemochromatosis probands (88 men, 58 women) with HFE C282Y homozygosity who were diagnosed in medical care. Univariate and multivariate analyses of total blood lymphocyte counts were evaluated using these variables: sex; age, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin concentration at diagnosis; units of blood removed by phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion; and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and -B alleles and haplotypes. The mean age at diagnosis was 49 +/- 14 years (range 18 - 80 years) in men and 50 +/- 13 years (range 22-88 years) in women. The correlations of total blood lymphocyte counts with sex, age, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin concentration at diagnosis, and units of blood removed by phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion were not significant at the 0.05 level. Univariate analyses revealed significant associations between total blood lymphocyte counts and presence of the HLA-A*01, -B*08, and -B*14 alleles, and the A*01-B*08 haplotype. Presence of the A*01 allele, B*08 allele, or A*01-B*08 haplotype were associated with a lower total blood lymphocyte count, whereas presence of the B*14 allele was associated with a greater total blood lymphocyte count. There was an inverse association of total blood lymphocyte count with units of phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion, serum ferritin concentration, and with presence of the A*01-B*08 haplotype. We conclude that there is a significant inverse relationship of total blood lymphocyte counts and severity of iron overload in hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity. The presence of the HLA-A*01 allele or the -B*08 allele was also associated with significantly lower total blood lymphocyte counts, whereas presence of the -B*14 allele was associated with significantly higher total blood lymphocyte counts. In univariate and multivariate analyses, total blood lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in probands with the HLA-A*01-B*08 haplotype than in probands without this haplotype.	16042809
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Mutations in the HFE gene in patients with rheumatic diseases].	Casopis lekaru ceskych	2005	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is one of the most common autosomal recessive diseases. Aim of the study. 1. To establish frequency of C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene (the hemochromatosis gene) in general population of the Czech Republic and in patients with hemochromatosis. 2. To find out whether hemochromatosis in homo- or heterozygous state plays a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases. In 32 patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, in 84 patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis, in 246 patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and in 481 persons of the control group the presence of HFE gene mutations was etablished. The HFE gene mutations were screened for by restriction enzyme analysis performed on PCR amplified products. In the control group, 6.86% carriers of the C282Y mutation and 26.61% those of H63D were found. Homozygous C282Y or H63D mutation was found in 90.6% (p<0.001) of patients with hemochromatosis. Heterozygous C282Y mutation was found in 12.2% (p<0.05) of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We didn't detected higher prevalence of HFE gene mutations in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Results of this study show that heterozygosity for C282Y mutation may be a risk factor for juvenile idiopathic arthritis but not for polymyositis and dermatomyositis.	16047841
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Unique genetic profile of hereditary hemochromatosis in Russians: high frequency of C282Y mutation in population, but not in patients.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common cause of primary iron overload induced by genetic impairment of iron metabolism. More than 80% of HH patients in populations of European origin are homozygotes for a single mutation C282Y, or compound heterozygotes for C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene. However, in the majority of Asian, African, Australasian, and Amerindian populations, frequencies of C282Y are close to zero. Data on the prevalence of HFE mutations in Russian population and in Russian patients with HH are very limited. In this work, we determined frequencies of C282Y and H63D in ethnical Russians living in the Central European region of Russia. Furthermore, we tested whether homozygocity for C282Y is the major cause of HH in Russians. We found that, in the Russian population, the frequency of C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is relatively high and corresponds to mean European levels. However, in contrast to the majority of European populations, homozygocity for C282Y is found only in a small proportion (5%) of patients with biochemical and clinical signs of HH. These data suggest that either the penetrance of C282Y in Russia is lower than in Western countries, or that a more frequent non-HFE dependent mechanism of primary iron overload dominates in Russian population.	16055358
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hfe mutations and iron overload in patients with alcoholic liver disease.	Arquivos de gastroenterologia		0.5	Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is generally associated with iron overload, which may contribute to its pathogenesis, through increased oxidative stress and cellular damage. There are conflicting reports in literature about hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations and the severity of liver disease in alcoholic patients. To compare the prevalence of mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene between patients with ALD and healthy controls; to assess the relation of HFE mutations with liver iron stores and liver disease severity. Liver biopsy specimens were obtained from 63 ALD patients (during routine treatment) and 52 healthy controls (during elective cholecystectomy). All individuals underwent routine liver function tests and HFE genotyping (to detect wild-type sequences and C282Y, H63D, S65C, E168Q, E168X, V59M, H63H, P160delC, Q127H, Q283P, V53M and W164X mutations). Associations between HFE mutations and risk of excessive liver iron stores, abnormal serum ferritin, liver fibrosis, or necroinflammatory activity were assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis. ALD patients had significantly higher serum ferritin and transferrin saturation than controls (both P<0.05), but the distribution of HFE mutations was similar between the two groups. For ALD patients, the odds ratio for having at least one HFE mutation and excessive liver iron stores was 17.23 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.09-142.34, P = 0.008). However, the presence of at least one HFE mutation was not associated with an increased risk of liver fibrosis or necroinflammatory activity. Active alcohol ingestion showed the strongest association to increased serum ferritin (OR = 8.87, 95% CI: 2.11-34.78, P = 0.003). s ALD patients do not present with a differential profile of HFE mutations from healthy controls. In ALD patients, however, the presence of at least one HFE mutation increases the risk of having excessive liver iron stores but has no detectable effects on liver disease activity or severity.	23657305
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Design and validation of a colorimetric test for the genetic diagnosis of hemochromatosis using α-phosphorothioate nucleotides.	Biochemical genetics	2013	0.95	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease highly prevalent in Northern Europe. Here we describe the performance of a genetic test for two mutations of the HFE gene (C282Y and H63D). It is based on a solid-phase PCR coupled with an α-phosphorothioate-mediated primer extension, conferring resistance to hydrolysis by ExoIII. Next, Elisa-like detection allows a colorimetric reading of the genetic test. We performed 322 tests (212 on the C282Y mutation, 110 on the H63D mutation) and compared the results with the RFLP method. Using OD ranges giving the minimum of uncertainty, the tests lead to high specificity and sensitivity, and they address the detection of mutated or normal bases in the HFE gene or the deduced phenotype (safe or ill), with positive predictive values or negative ones greater than 0.96. This method is therefore proposed as a primary test or as a confirming test.	23674081
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron absorption by heterozygous carriers of the HFE C282Y mutation associated with hemochromatosis.	The American journal of clinical nutrition	2004	0.5	Research conducted before genotyping was possible suggested that subjects heterozygous for the genetic mutation associated with hemochromatosis absorbed nonheme iron more efficiently than did control subjects when tested with a fortified meal. Heme-iron absorption in these subjects has not been reported. We compared the absorption of heme and nonheme iron from minimally or highly fortified test meals between HFE C282Y-heterozygous and wild-type control subjects. After prospective genotyping of 256 healthy volunteers, 11 C282Y-heterozygous and 12 wild-type control subjects were recruited, and their iron absorption was compared by using a hamburger test meal with or without added iron and ascorbic acid. After retrospective genotyping of 103 participants in previous iron-absorption studies, 5 C282Y-heterozygous subjects were compared with 72 wild-type control subjects. HFE C282Y-heterozygous subjects did not differ significantly from wild-type control subjects in their absorption of either heme or nonheme iron from minimally or highly fortified test meals. No differences were detected in blood indexes of iron status (including serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and non-transferrin-bound iron) or in blood lipids or transaminases, but heterozygotes had significantly greater, although normal, fasting glucose concentrations than did wild-type control subjects. Compound heterozygotes (those who had both HFE C282Y and H63D mutations) absorbed more nonheme (but not heme) iron from meals with high (but not low) iron bioavailability. HFE C282Y-heterozygous subjects did not absorb dietary iron more efficiently, even when foods were highly fortified with iron from ferrous sulfate and ascorbic acid, than did control subjects. Iron fortification of foods should not pose an additional health risk to HFE C282Y heterozygotes.	15447900
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	To tell or not to tell - what to do about p.C282Y heterozygotes identified by HFE screening.	Clinical genetics	2013	3.89	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common preventable disorder of iron overload that can result in liver cirrhosis and reduced lifespan. Most HH is due to homozygosity for the HFE p.C282Y substitution. We conducted a study of screening for p.C282Y in high schools where p.C282Y heterozygotes (CY) individuals were informed of their genotype by letter. We studied whether these individuals understood the implications of their genotype, whether this resulted in anxiety or reduced health perception and whether cascade testing was higher in families of CY than wild-type homozygous (CC) individuals. We found 586 of 5757 (1 in 10) screened individuals were CY. One month after receiving their result, 83% correctly answered that they have one copy of p.C282Y. There was no adverse change in anxiety or health perception from prior to screening to 1 month after receiving results. Significantly more family members of CY individuals than CC individuals were informed about HH and had testing for HH. In conclusion, we found that informing CY individuals of their genotype does not increase anxiety and the implications are generally well understood. This leads to cascade testing in a minority of families. CY individuals should be informed of their genetic status when identified by population screening.	23121079
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: insights from the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study.	Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program	2009	0.5	Hemochromatosis comprises a group of inherited disorders resulting from mutations of genes involved in regulating iron metabolism. The multicenter, multi-ethnic Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study screened approximately 100,000 participants in the US and Canada, testing for HFE mutations, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. As in other studies, HFE C282Y homozygosity was common in Caucasians but rare in other ethnic groups, and there was a marked heterogeneity of disease expression in C282Y homozygotes. Nevertheless, this genotype was often associated with elevations of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation and with iron stores of more than four grams in men but not in women. If liver biopsy was performed, in some cases because of evidence of hepatic dysfunction, fibrosis or cirrhosis was often found. Combined elevations of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were observed in non-C282Y homozygotes of all ethnic groups, most prominently Asians, but not often with iron stores of more than four grams. Future studies to discover modifier genes that affect phenotypic expression in C282Y hemochromatosis should help identify patients who are at greatest risk of developing iron overload and who may benefit from continued monitoring of iron status to detect progressive iron loading.	20008199
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis and diabetes mellitus: implications for clinical practice.	Nature reviews. Endocrinology	2010	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic condition that can lead to unregulated absorption of iron from the gut with resultant iron overload. The most common form of HH is caused by mutations in the HFE gene, with most cases of HH presenting in patients who are homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation. The prevalence of HFE gene mutations in persons of Northern European ancestry is fairly high (0.3-0.7% homozygous and 9-14% heterozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation), but the penetrance of the disease is considered fairly low and is quite variable. While routine screening of the general population is not recommended, a targeted approach to screening in symptomatic patients and in those with a family member with iron overload is warranted. Untreated, iron overload can lead to considerable morbidity including liver cirrhosis, arthritis and diabetes mellitus, and increased mortality. The pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus in HH is thought to be due primarily to defects in the early insulin response to glucose. An Hfe(-/-) mouse model of HH has demonstrated defects in beta-cell function and beta-cell apoptosis that may be mediated by increased oxidative stress. Fortunately, these defects seem to be reversible if phlebotomy treatment is initiated before the development of cirrhosis or diabetes mellitus in patients. Further research into the long-term effects of treatment on prevention of diabetes mellitus in HH is needed.	20010968
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	"""Huh-7: a human """"hemochromatotic"""" cell line."""	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2010	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HC) is commonly associated with homozygosity for the cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution at position 282 (C282Y) of the HFE protein. This mutation prevents HFE from binding beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)M) and reaching the cell surface. We have discovered that a widely used hepatoma cell line, Huh-7, carries a HFE mutation similar to that associated with human HC. By HFE gene sequencing of Huh-7 genomic DNA, we found a TAC nucleotide deletion (c. 691_693del) responsible for loss of a tyrosine at position 231 (p. Y231del) of the HFE protein. This mutation affects a conserved hydrophobic region in a loop connecting two beta strands that make up the alpha3 domain of HFE, not far from the 282 site. HFE was detected by western blot in HepG2 but not in Huh-7 cell membrane fractions. In WRL-68 cells expressing wild-type HFE, the HFE protein was largely found at the plasma membrane where it colocalizes with beta(2)M. On the contrary, the HFE-Y231del mutant, similarly to an exogenously expressed HFE-C282Y mutant, failed to reach the plasma membrane and did not colocalize with membrane-expressed beta(2)M. C282Y mutant HFE in HC is associated with inadequate hepcidin expression. We found that Huh-7 cells display lower hepcidin messenger RNA levels as compared to HepG2 cells, which carry a wild-type HFE. Interestingly, hepcidin messenger RNA levels increased significantly in Huh-7 cells stably expressing exogenous wild-type HFE at the plasma membrane. Huh-7 cells may represent a novel and valuable tool to investigate the role of altered HFE traffic in iron metabolism and pathogenesis of human HFE HC.	20017200
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE, SLC40A1, HAMP, HJV, TFR2, and FTL mutations detected by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography after iron phenotyping and HFE C282Y and H63D genotyping in 785 HEIRS Study participants.	American journal of hematology	2009	5.0	We sought to identify mutations that could explain iron phenotype heterogeneity in adults with previous HFE genotyping to detect C282Y and H63D. HEIRS Study participants genotyped for C282Y and H63D were designated as high transferrin saturation (TS) and/or serum ferritin (SF) (high TS/SF), low TS/SF, or controls. We grouped 191 C282Y homozygotes as high TS/SF, low TS/SF, or controls, and 594 other participants by race/ethnicity as high TS/SF or controls. Using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), we screened 20 regions of HFE, SLC40A1, HAMP, HJV, TFR2, and FTL in each participant. DHPLC analyses were successful in 99.3% of 791 participants and detected 117 different mutations. In C282Y homozygotes, 4.0% of high TS/SF participants had SLC40A1 Q248H, HAMP -72C>T, or HAMP R59G heterozygosity (0% Controls; P = 0.1200). In whites, 4.1% with high TS/SF and 1.3% of controls had HFE S65C or E168Q (P = 0.3049). HJV c.-6C>G and FTL L55L frequencies were greater in whites with high TS/SF than controls (0.0811 vs. 0.0200, P = 0.0144; 0.5743 vs. 0.4400, P = 0.0204, respectively). One Hispanic with high TS/SF (1.3%) had HAMP G71D heterozygosity. In blacks, SLC40A1 Q248H frequencies did not differ significantly between high TS/SF and control participants. Among Asians, 2.8% with high TS/SF were HFE V295A heterozygotes. Mutations other than HFE C282Y and H63D reported to be pathogenic were infrequently detected in high TS/SF participants. Genetic regions in linkage disequilibrium with HJV c.-6C>G and FTL L55L could partly explain high TS/SF phenotypes in whites. Am. J. Hematol., 2009. Published 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.	19787796
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Mouse models of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency reveal significant threshold effects of hyperhomocysteinemia.	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	2009	5.3	Untreated cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency in humans is characterized by extremely elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy>200 microM), with thrombosis as the major cause of morbidity. Treatment with vitamins and diet leads to a dramatic reduction in thrombotic events, even though patients often still have severe elevations in tHcy (>80 microM). To understand the difference between extreme and severe hyperhomocysteinemia, we have examined two mouse models of CBS deficiency: Tg-hCBS Cbs(-/-) mice, with a mean serum tHcy of 169 microM, and Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice, with a mean tHcy of 296 microM. Only Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) animals exhibited strong biological phenotypes, including facial alopecia, osteoporosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the liver and kidney, and a 20% reduction in mean survival time. Metabolic profiling of serum and liver reveals that Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice have significantly elevated levels of free oxidized homocysteine but not protein-bound homocysteine in serum and elevation of all forms of homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine in the liver compared to Tg-hCBS Cbs(-/-) mice. RNA profiling of livers indicate that Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) and Tg-hCBS Cbs(-/-) mice have unique gene signatures, with minimal overlap. Our results indicate that there is a clear pathogenic threshold effect for tHcy and bring into question the idea that mild elevations in tHcy are directly pathogenic.	18987302
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A CSF biomarker panel for identification of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Neurology	2009	8.17	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with complicated pathogenesis that poses challenges with respect to diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. To identify a biomarker panel that elucidates ALS disease pathogenesis, distinguishes patients with ALS from neurologic disease controls, and correlates with ALS disease characteristics, and to determine the effect of HFE gene variants, a potential risk factor for sporadic ALS, on the biomarker profile. We obtained CSF samples by lumbar puncture from 41 patients with ALS and 33 neurologic disease controls. All patients were genotyped for HFE polymorphisms. We performed a multiplex cytokine and growth factor analysis and immunoassays for iron-related analytes. Classification statistics were generated using a support vector machine algorithm. The groups of patients with ALS and neurologic disease controls were each associated with distinct profiles of biomarkers. Fourteen biomarkers differed between patients with ALS and the control group. The five proteins with the lowest p values differentiated patients with ALS from controls with 89.2% accuracy, 87.5% sensitivity, and 91.2% specificity. Expression of IL-8 was higher in those patients with lower levels of physical function. Expression of beta2-microglobulin was higher in subjects carrying an H63D HFE allele, while expression of several markers was higher in subjects carrying a C282Y HFE allele. A CSF inflammatory profile associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis may distinguish patients with ALS from neurologic disease controls, and may serve as a biomarker panel to aid in the diagnosis of ALS pending further validation. Some of these biomarkers differ by HFE genotype.	18987350
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Porphyria cutanea tarda, hepatitis C, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase and mutations of HFE gene. A case-control study.	Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland)	2009	0.5	Hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are known risk factors for porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), but interactions with erythrocytic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) have seldom been addressed. In order to examine the links between these factors, we conducted a multicentre prospective case-control study. PCT patients with (n = 32) or without HCV (n = 28) were matched to HCV+ (n = 32) and HCV- controls (n = 28). HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) were analyzed by PCR. PCT+/HCV+ patients were younger than PCT+/HCV- patients (46.9 vs. 58.2 years, p < 0.001). UROD values were not significantly different in HCV+ and HCV- patients. Both C282Y and H63D were more frequent in PCT+ patients than in controls, but there was no difference in HFE genotype according to HCV seropositivity. Mean UROD was lower in case of HFE mutations in both PCT patients and controls. In French patients, HCV infection is probably the major causal factor of PCT. It is not linked with HFE mutations, although they are significantly associated with PCT. A low erythrocytic UROD might be a predisposing factor. The UROD value was lower in patients with HFE mutations, suggesting a possible interaction between HFE genotype and UROD levels.	19001803
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Severity of iron overload of proband determines serum ferritin levels in families with HFE-related hemochromatosis: the HEmochromatosis FAmily Study.	Journal of hepatology	2009	10.59	In families of patients with clinically detected hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) early screening has been suggested to prevent morbidity and mortality. Here, we aim to identify determinants for iron overload in first-degree family members of C282Y homozygous probands with clinically detected HH. Data on HFE-genotype, iron parameters, demographics, lifestyle factors and health, were collected from 224 Dutch C282Y homozygous patients with clinically diagnosed HH and 735 of their first-degree family members (FDFM), all participating in the HEmochromatosis FAmily Study (HEFAS). The best predictive multivariable model forecasted 45% of variation of the serum ferritin levels. In this model severity of iron overload in the proband significantly predicted serum ferritin levels in FDFM. Other significant determinants in this model consisted of C282Y homozygosity, compound heterozygosity, age at testing for serum ferritin and supplemental iron intake, whereas a low body mass index showed a protective effect. This study provides a model to assess the risk of development of iron overload for relatives of probands with HH. These results might be instrumental in the development of an optimal strategy for future family screening programs.	19008010
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical manifestations of hemochromatosis in HFE C282Y homozygotes identified by screening.	Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie	2008	0.5	Patients with hemochromatosis may suffer organ damage from iron overload, often with serious clinical consequences. To assess prevalences of self-reported symptoms and clinical signs and conditions in persons homozygous for the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation (C282Y) identified by screening. Participants were adults 25 years of age or older enrolled in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study. C282Y homozygotes (n=282) were compared with control participants without the HFE C282Y or H63D alleles (ie, wild type/wild type; n=364). Previously diagnosed C282Y homozygotes and newly diagnosed homozygotes with elevated serum ferritin levels had higher prevalences of certain symptoms such as chronic fatigue (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.34 to 5.95, and OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.07 to 3.75, respectively), and had more hyperpigmentation on physical examination (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.50 to 15.06, and OR 3.7; 95% CI 1.10 to 12.16, respectively) and swelling or tenderness of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints (OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.37 to 13.03, and OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.17 to 9.49, respectively) than control subjects. Joint stiffness was also more common among newly diagnosed C282Y homozygotes with elevated serum ferritin than among control subjects (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.38 to 5.30). However, the sex- and age-adjusted prevalences of self-reported symptoms and signs of liver disease, heart disease, diabetes and most other major clinical manifestations of hemochromatosis were similar in C282Y homozygotes and control subjects. Some symptoms and conditions associated with hemochromatosis were more prevalent among C282Y homozygotes identified by screening than among control subjects, but prevalences of most outcomes were similar in C282Y homozygotes and controls in this primary care-based study.	19018338
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis in the new millennium.	Journal of hepatology	2000	10.59	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HHC) is a common inherited disorder of iron metabolism characterised by progressive iron loading of parenchymal cells of the liver, pancreas, heart and other organs ultimately leading to cirrhosis and organ failure. Despite HLA studies which localised the defective gene to the short arm of chromosome 6, the haemochromatosis gene remained elusive until 1996, when the gene was identified by a massive positional cloning effort. The haemochromatosis gene (HFE) encodes a novel nonclassical MHC class-1-like molecule. Two missense mutations have been identified in patients with HHC, a G to A at nucleotide 845, resulting in a substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at amino acid 282 (referred to as the C282Y mutation) and a C to G at nucleotide 187, resulting in a substitution of aspartate for histidine at amino acid 63 (H63D). An average of 85-90% of patients with typical clinical features of HHC are homozygous for the C282Y mutation. H63D is not associated with the same degree of iron loading as C282Y. Clinical expression is variable depending on environmental (dietary) iron, physiological and pathological blood loss and as yet unidentified modifying genetic factors. One recent Australian study indicates that only about 50% of homozygous subjects are fully expressing and symptomatic and that about 30% show no clinical or biochemical expression. Genetic tests for identifying mutations in the HFE gene provide precise means for diagnosis, family testing and population screening and have led to re-evaluation of the indications for liver biopsy in this disease. At the present time, however, the most practical and cost-effective method of screening is for phenotypic expression by transferrin saturation or unsaturated iron binding capacity measurement. In the future, population screening by genotype should be feasible once the relevant technical, legal and ethical issues are resolved.	10728794
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Primary hemochromatosis in asymptomatic young patients].	Anales de medicina interna (Madrid, Spain : 1984)	2000	0.5	In order to increase our knowledge of adult haemochromatosis epidemiology and its clinical behaviour in young patients, we studied 4 patients from 3 pedigrees with idiopathic haemochromatosis. Diagnostic criteria were: 1) Discarding the presence of secondary haemosiderosis. 2) Histological and histochemical confirmation of hepatic iron overload. Mean age at time of diagnosis was 25.2 years. Male/female ratio was 1. All of them were clinically asymptomatic, what shows the main difference with juvenile haemochromatosis, presenting earlier and more aggressively. Physical examination could not find abnormalities in any case. Regarding analytical studies, the main results were as follows: mean serum iron level was 209.5 mg/dl (s = 37.8), transferrin 206 mg/dl (s = 24.5), transferrin saturation was 77.4% (s = 9); ferritin, ASAT & ALAT were abnormal exclusively in the 2 males), the other measurements being between normal limits in all cases. Abdominal MRI showed an impaired hepatic signal in 2 cases. Liver biopsy was accomplished in 3 of them, showing massive deposits of hemosiderin in the hepatocytes in the 2 male cases and chronic hepatitis in one of them. There was no evidence of damage to other organs. Genetic studies showed that the 2 siblings were homozygous for the HFE 845GAEA (C282Y) mutation and in the other 2 cases HLA-A3,B7 was found to be associated. At present, after a year or more, all of them remain asymptomatic, liver function tests and mean serum ferritin levels are within normal limits, IST is < 65%, while Hb continues being > 11 g/dl. To conclude, we would like to emphasize the extraordinary importance of early diagnosis and careful treatment in this common and remediable illness (otherwise lethal), to reach a normal and symptoms-free lifespan.	10730398

We present a simple, rapid PCR-SSCP multiplex screening method allowing the simultaneous detection of both substitutions. Furthermore, testing the method on 420 Danish blood donors revealed the presence of a hitherto undetected third substitution in 13 individuals. The new substitution, a 193A-->T transversion, affects codon 65 changing the code for serine to that of cysteine (S65C). It may thus have functional consequences for the HLA class protein encoded by the HFE-gene. The allele frequencies observed were: H63D 14.8%, C282Y 6.2% and S65C 1.5%, which for the two former alleles are in agreement with frequencies reported for other North European population samples.	10738531
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effects of HFE C282Y and H63D polymorphisms and polygenic background on iron stores in a large community sample of twins.	American journal of human genetics	2000	10.79	The aim of this study was to assess and to compare the role of HFE polymorphisms and other genetic factors in variation in iron stores. Blood samples were obtained from 3,375 adult male and female twins (age range 29-82 years) recruited from the Australian Twin Registry. There were 1,233 complete pairs (562 monozygotic and 571 dizygotic twins). Serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation with iron, and ferritin were measured, and the HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes were determined. The frequency of the C282Y allele was.072, and that of the H63D allele was.141. Significant sources of variation in the indices of iron status included age, sex, age-sex interaction, body-mass index, and both the C282Y and H63D genotypes. The iron, transferrin, and saturation values of CC and CY subjects differed significantly, but the ferritin values did not. After correction for age and body-mass index, 23% and 31% of the variance in iron, 66% and 49% of the variance in transferrin, 33% and 47% of the variance in transferrin saturation, and 47% and 47% of the variance in ferritin could be explained by additive genetic factors, for men and women, respectively. HFE C282Y and H63D variation accounted for <5% of the corrected phenotypic variance, except for saturation (12% in women and 5% in men). We conclude that HFE CY and HD heterozygotes differ in iron status from the CC and HH homozygotes and that serum transferrin saturation is more affected than is serum ferritin. There are highly significant effects of other as-yet-unidentified genes on iron stores, in addition to HFE genotype.	10739755
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary juvenile haemochromatosis: a genetically heterogeneous life-threatening iron-storage disease.	QJM : monthly journal of the Association of Physicians	1998	0.5	Juvenile haemochromatosis is a rare inborn error of iron metabolism with clinical manifestations before 30 years of age. Unlike adult haemochromatosis which principally affects men, juvenile haemochromatosis affects the sexes equally; it causes early endocrine failure, dilated cardiomyopathy and joint disease. We report four patients (two of each sex) from three pedigrees affected by juvenile haemochromatosis with a mean onset at 22 years (range 14-30). All had endocrine deficiency with postpubertal gonadal failure secondary to pituitary disease; two suffered near-fatal cardiomyopathy with heart failure. Mean time to diagnosis from the first clinical signs of disease was 9.8 years (range 0.5-20) but general health and parameters of iron storage responded favourably to iron-depletion therapy. A 24-year-old man listed for heart transplantation because of cardiomyopathy [left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction 16%] responded to intravenous iron chelation with desferrioxamine combined with phlebotomy (ejection fraction 31%). A 27-year-old woman with subacute biventricular heart failure refractory to medication required orthotopic cardiac transplantation before the diagnosis was established (LV ejection fraction 25%). Genetic studies showed that these two patients with cardiomyopathy from unrelated families were heterozygous for the HFE 845G-->A (C282Y) mutation and wild-type at the H63D locus: complete sequencing of the intron-exon boundaries and entire coding sequence of the HFE gene failed to identify additional lesions. Two siblings in a pedigree without cardiomyopathy were wild-type at the HFE C282Y locus; although the brother harboured a single copy of the 187C-->G (H63D) allele, segregation analysis showed that in neither sibling was the iron-storage disease linked to MHC Class I markers on chromosome 6p. Juvenile haemochromatosis is thus a genetically heterogenous disorder distinct from the common adult variant.	10024915
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron overload in patients with sideroblastic anaemia is not related to the presence of the haemochromatosis Cys282Tyr and His63Asp mutations.	British journal of haematology	1999	5.4	Forty Caucasian patients with primary acquired sideroblastic anaemia (SA), were investigated for the presence of the Cys282Tyr and/or His63Asp mutation as possible cofactor(s) for iron overload. One patient was heterozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation and 13 heterozygotes and one homozygote for the His63Asp mutation were found (no difference compared with controls). SA patients with normal codon 63 had a mean ferritin level of 923+/-815 microg/l whereas those with codon 63 mutation had 769+/-577 microg/l (P=0.64). We conclude that ineffective erythropoiesis with no associated mutation in the HFE gene can lead to iron overload in SA patients.	10027719
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and iron: increased prevalence of mutations of the HFE gene in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.	Journal of hepatology	1999	10.59	Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasingly recognized, and its pathogenesis is believed to involve increased oxidative stress. Elevated levels of serum ferritin and positive liver iron stains are often observed in patients with NASH, and the pathogenesis of liver injury due to iron is also thought to involve oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association of NASH and mutations in the HFE gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). Clinical, laboratory, and histopathological data on all 57 subjects with a final diagnosis of NASH seen between August 1990 and August 1997 at our Liver Center were analyzed. Thirty-six Caucasian subjects (23 men) with NASH underwent mutational analyses of HFE gene mutations performed. The prevalence of HFE gene mutations was compared to that in 348 Caucasian normal controls. Data were analyzed by both parameteric and non-parametric methods with similar results. One subject (2.8%) with NASH was homozygous for the C282Y mutation and six (16.7%) were heterozygous, compared with 0%, and 11.2%, respectively, of controls. Two (5.6%) subjects with NASH were homozygous for the H63D mutation and 16 (44.4%) were heterozygous, whereas 2.9% and 26.4%, respectively, of controls had these genotypes. The prevalence of heterozygosity (61.1%) for either mutation was significantly higher in subjects with NASH than in controls (38%) (p = 0.008), and the prevalence of homozygosity or heterozygosity combined in NASH subjects (69.4%) was significantly higher than for controls (40.5%, p = 0.001). Sex (63-67% male) and age at diagnosis of NASH did not differ between those with or without HFE mutations, but men with NASH were significantly more likely than women to have the H63D mutation (15/23 vs. 3/13, p<0.05) Levels of serum ferritin, iron, transferrin saturation levels, and the degree of hepatic iron staining were significantly higher (p<0.05) in subjects with NASH who carried an HFE mutation than in those without. Differences in hepatic iron concentrations or hepatic iron indices between NASH subjects with and without HFE mutations were not significant. Those with C282Y mutations had significantly more hepatic fibrosis than those without (p<0.05). Those with HFE mutations had significantly higher levels of serum ALT (90+/-11 [mean +/- SE]) than those without (55+/-6; p = 0.02). The prevalences of the HFE gene mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis are increased among North American subjects with NASH.	10488699
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Update on hereditary hemochromatosis and the HFE gene.	Mayo Clinic proceedings	1999	5.92	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is the most common inherited single gene disorder in people of northern European descent. Hereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by increased intestinal absorption of iron leading to its deposition into multiple organs. The classic description of HHC is bronze diabetes in a patient with cirrhosis. Hereditary hemochromatosis is increasingly being diagnosed at an earlier, less symptomatic stage. Diagnosis is based on an elevated fasting early morning transferrin saturation. Treatment is by phlebotomy, which, if initiated before the development of cirrhosis or diabetes, is associated with a normal life expectancy. Recently, a gene associated with HHC was discovered and named HFE. Two point mutations of this gene have been referred to as C282Y and H63D. Several US and European studies have found that 60% to 93% of patients with suspected HHC are homozygous for C282Y. Positive results of HFE gene testing may eliminate the need for a liver biopsy in selected cases. The greatest utility of HFE gene testing will likely be in screening family members of an identified proband and in helping to resolve ambiguous cases.	10488796
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased risk of acute myocardial infarction in carriers of the hemochromatosis gene Cys282Tyr mutation : a prospective cohort study in men in eastern Finland.	Circulation	1999	17.05	Background-Homozygosity for a relatively common Cys282Tyr mutation of the human hemochromatosis-associated (HFE) gene was recently found to account for most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis. Because excess iron has been postulated to enhance risk of vascular disease, we studied whether occurrence of this mutation was associated with increased risk of first acute myocardial infarction in healthy middle-aged men in a prospective cohort study. Methods and Results-Study subjects were the 1150 participants in the population-based Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study (KIHD), aged 42, 48, 54, or 60 years at baseline, who had no coronary heart disease at baseline and for whom a DNA sample was available. Information about myocardial infarctions was collected prospectively by use of FINMONICA (FINnish MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease study) and hospital data. Events were classified by MONICA (MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease study) diagnostic criteria. The HFE Cys282Tyr mutation was assayed by a solid-phase minisequencing technique. One subject was homozygous and 76 individuals were heterozygous for the HFE Cys282Tyr mutation (6.7%). During a mean follow-up of 9 years, 8 (10.4%) of 77 carriers and 60 (5.6%) of 1073 noncarriers experienced an acute myocardial infarction. In a Cox proportional hazards model allowing for the other strongest risk factors, the carriers had a 2.3-fold (95% CI 1. 1 to 4.8; P=0.03) risk of acute myocardial infarction compared with noncarriers. Conclusions-Male carriers of the common hemochromatosis gene mutation are at 2-fold risk for first acute myocardial infarction compared with noncarriers.	10491370
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in a multi-ethnic control population.	International journal of molecular medicine	1999	2.35	Recently a candidate gene for hereditary hemo-chromatosis, HFE, was identified. The finding raises the possibility for genetic testing to provide earlier detection and more complete genotypic evaluation of hemochromatosis affected individuals. We determined the frequency of the HFE polymorphisms, C282Y and H63D, in a randomly selected multi-ethnic control population for establishment of a hemochromatosis genetic testing program. Prevalence was determined by PCR amplification and restriction enzyme digestion of HFE in 100 Caucasians, 100 Hispanics, and 56 African Americans. Heterozygosity for C282Y was detected in 8% of Caucasians, 3% of Hispanics, and 2% of African Americans. Homozygosity for C282Y was detected in 1% of Caucasians. Heterozygosity for H63D was detected in 24% of Caucasians, 15% Hispanics, and 3.5% of African Americans. Homozygosity for H63D was present in 4% of Caucasians and 1% of Hispanics. One Hispanic case was double heterozygous for C282Y and H63D. These results indicate the highest prevalence of C282Y and H63D in the Caucasian population. Additionally, we demonstrate C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in our Hispanic and African American populations, groups in which prevalence rates remain less defined. Our results support the need for thorough interpretation of genetic results for hereditary hemochromatosis in various ethnic populations.	10493980
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutation analysis in the HFE gene in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (Quebec, Canada).	British journal of haematology	2000	5.4	A mutation analysis of the HFE gene followed, when applicable, by sequencing was performed on 47 patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) living in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. The C282Y and H63D mutations were present on 50% and 20.3% of the HH chromosomes respectively. These frequencies were very different from those found in other populations and could be, at least partially, the result of a founder effect. No new mutation was identified among the remaining 28.1% of the HH chromosomes. Five of the eight probands with no mutation in the HFE gene had a severe and early onset suggestive of juvenile haemochromatosis.	10792295
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Population screening for hemochromatosis: a comparison of unbound iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, and C282Y genotyping in 5,211 voluntary blood donors.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2000	0.5	Early diagnosis and treatment of hemochromatosis is essential to prevent organ damage. Screening strategies to detect early hemochromatosis include testing for iron overload and/or genetic testing. Voluntary blood donors numbering 5,211 were screened with unbound iron-binding capacity (UIBC), transferrin saturation (TS), and genetic testing for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. The study found 16 C282Y homozygotes (1 in 327), 69 compound heterozygotes, 371 simple heterozygotes, and 4,755 normals. There were 5 men and 11 women homozygotes with a mean age of 42, range 28 to 57. Mean UIBC (24 +/- 7 microL) and TS (48% +/- 17%) in homozygotes were significantly different from compound heterozygotes, simple heterozygotes, and normals (ANOVA). Only 3 homozygotes had an elevated serum ferritin. Family studies found an additional 4 iron-loaded homozygotes. Optimal thresholds were < or =28 micromol/L for UIBC and > or =46% for TS. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed an area under the curve for UIBC of 0.93 (0. 85-1.0, 95% confidence interval), and for TS of 0.83 (0.7-0.95). Screening with UIBC to preselect those for genotyping is a cost-efficient strategy for population screening for hemochromatosis.	10796893
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The gene TFR2 is mutated in a new type of haemochromatosis mapping to 7q22.	Nature genetics	2000	31.62	Haemochromatosis is a common recessive disorder characterized by progressive iron overload, which may lead to severe clinical complications. Most patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE on 6p (refs 1-5). A locus for juvenile haemochromatosis (HFE2) maps to 1q (ref. 7). Here we report a new locus (HFE3) on 7q22 and show that a homozygous nonsense mutation in the gene encoding transferrin receptor-2 (TFR2) is found in people with haemochromatosis that maps to HFE3.	10802645
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutation, C282Y causing hereditary hemochromatosis in Caucasian is extremely rare in Korean population.	Journal of Korean medical science	2000	1.26	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE), which affects 1 in 400 and has an estimated carrier frequency of 1 in 10 individuals in Western population, results in multiple organ damage caused by iron deposition, and is treatable if detected early. C282Y mutation in HFE gene has been known to be responsible for the most hereditary hemochromatosis cases and 5-10% of white subjects are heterozygous for this mutation. However, the prevalence of hemochromatosis in the Asian population was reported to be very low and ethnic heterogeneity has been suspected. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of heterozygosity and homozygosity for the C282Y HFE gene mutations in 502 unrelated Koreans. Results revealed that none of them had the mutant gene, suggesting a significant ethnic difference when compared with Caucasians. Our study excluded underlying possibility of hereditary hemochromatosis in Korean which could mimic the findings of alcoholic liver disease with iron overload or liver cirrhosis with chronic hepatitis C.	10803694
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Are the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutation and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection risk factors for porphyria cutanea tarda?].	Orvosi hetilap	2000	0.29	As it is not clear whether mutations in hemochromatosis gene (HFE) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) act independently in the pathogenesis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), and prevalence of both risk factors reveals a great variety in different parts of the world, PCT patients from our Central East European country were investigated for this aspect. The occurrence of the C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE gene were determined in 19 PCT patients and compared with the reported control frequencies. Furthermore, the presence of HCV infection was determined and related to the patients' HFE status. The C282Y mutation was found in 3/19 cases (one patient was homozygous and two heterozygous), with an 10.5% allele frequency (vs. 3.8% control) (p < 0.05). Five patients were heterozygous for the H63D mutation, allele frequency 13.1%, which did not differ from the reported control prevalence of 12.3%. Six patients (31.7%) were HCV-RNA positive, out of the six one was heterozygous for H63D mutation and one was compound heterozygous. HCV infection and HFE C282Y mutations may probably be independent predisposing factors for development of PCT in Hungarian patients.	11037612
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis gene mutations in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.	Heart (British Cardiac Society)	2000	0.5	Two common mutations of the haemochromatosis associated gene (HFE) (cys282tyr (C282Y) and his63asp (H63D)) have been implicated in haemochromatosis and as modulators in cardiovascular disease. To investigate the role of these mutations in the pathogenesis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Case-control and prospective cohort study of patients attending a cardiomyopathy unit in a tertiary referral cardiac centre. 207 unrelated white patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, followed up for 259 patient years, and 200 controls were tested for HFE C282Y and H63D mutations by polymerase chain reaction and restriction digestion. 31/207 patients (15%) v 24/200 controls (12%) carried C282Y (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.2 (95% confidence interval 0.7 to 2.2)), 74/207 (36%) v 53/200 (27%) carried H63D (OR 1.6 (1.1 to 2.5)), and 10/207 (4.8%) v 4/200 (2%) were compound heterozygotes (OR 2.6 (0.8 to 8.5)). Four patients and six controls were H63D homozygous and one was C282Y homozygous. There was a progressive increase in mean serum iron ([Fe]) and transferrin saturations from patients with no mutation ([Fe] = 16.3 micromol/l, transferrin saturation = 23.7%) through H63D heterozygotes (17.5 micromol/l, 25.8%), C282Y heterozygotes (17.1 micromol/l, 26.6%), H63D homozygotes (20.0 micromol/l, 33.5%), compound heterozygotes (26.8 micromol/l, 41.7%), and C282Y homozygotes (34 micromol/l, 71%). At follow up (median 90 months) the rate of death or cardiac transplantation was 52/207 (25%). C282Y heterozygotes had less ventricular dilatation (mean (SD): 59.9 (1.7) mm v 64.9 (0.9) mm, p < 0.05), better fractional shortening (24 (1. 7)% v 18.8 (1.4)%, p < 0.01), and a trend towards improved survival without transplantation. [Fe] and transferrin saturation did not correlate with disease severity and were not associated with reduced survival. The frequency of the H63D mutation is significantly increased in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. As H63D has a relatively minor effect on iron status, the mechanism of this association may be unrelated to iron metabolism.	11040018
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Differential HFE allele expression in hemochromatosis heterozygotes.	Gastroenterology	2000	18.19	Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with C282Y homozygosity. Some heterozygotes may also present with abnormal iron parameters. However, the precise role of H63D and C282Y mutations in iron overload is poorly understood. We investigated the level of expression of the mutated and unmutated HFE alleles in these heterozygous patients. We studied the expression of HFE messenger RNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 34 heterozygotes using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by enzymatic digestion or sequence analysis of the PCR products, which allows relative quantification of mutated and unmutated transcripts. HFE proteins were quantified by Western blotting in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphocyte extracts from 2 C282Y and H63D homozygotes and a compound heterozygote. (187C > G; H63D) mutated transcripts predominated in H63D and compound heterozygotes and the normal transcripts in C282Y heterozygotes. The amount of HFE protein was increased in the H63D homozygotes and the compound heterozygote compared with the C282Y homozygotes. In addition, we found a new mutation at codon 282 (C282S) associated with severe iron overload. We demonstrate the existence of differential allelic expression of the HFE alleles, suggesting that the (187C > G; H63D) mutation plays a role in the disease expression in H63D heterozygotes, in particular when associated with environmental or host factors.	11040194
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence and clinical significance of HFE gene mutations in patients with iron overload.	The American journal of gastroenterology	2000	0.5	The HFE gene contains two mutant alleles; C282Y and H63D. The C282Y mutation occurs in 55-100% of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. The aim of our study was to re-examine the frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations in patients with mild and marked iron overload and in normal subjects. A total of 82 patients with iron overload were included in this study and had hepatic iron index determination and/or quantitation of iron stores by phlebotomy. The control group consisted of 81 healthy blood donors. HFE mutation analysis was performed on leukocyte DNA using PCR-amplified genomic DNA. Of patients with iron overload, 70/82 (85%) were homozygous for C282Y versus 2/81 (2.5%) in the control population. Four patients had no HFE mutations despite significant iron overload, including a sister and brother (brother not included in the study group) with hepatic iron concentrations >500 micromoles/g dry weight. In all, 85% of our patients with iron overload were C282Y homozygotes, although a few had no HFE gene mutations. Pooled data and analysis of chromosomes considered to be at risk for H63D indicate that H63D is associated with iron overload.	11051367
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations in Danish patients with clinical haemochromatosis initially diagnosed by phenotypic methods.	European journal of haematology	2003	2.54	To assess the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations on the HFE gene in Danish patients with clinical hereditary haemochromatosis initially diagnosed by phenotypic methods. In the period 1950-1985, an epidemiological survey in Denmark identified 179 patients with clinical idiopathic haemochromatosis diagnosed by phenotypic methods (serum transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, liver biopsy and mobilisable body iron stores). In 32 unrelated patients, frozen blood samples were available for genetic analysis. In a subsequent series of 26 unrelated Danish patients, a phenotypic diagnosis of clinical idiopathic haemochromatosis was made before blood samples were taken for HFE genotyping. The total series consisted of 58 patients (40 men and 18 women) with a median age of 60 yrs (range 18-74). HFE genotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Among the patients, 55 of 58 (94.8%) were C282Y/C282Y homozygous. One 63-year-old woman (1.7%) was compound C282Y/H63D heterozygous. Two women (3.4%), aged 42 and 43 yrs were negative for both the C282Y and the H63D mutation. In the Danish population, homozygosity for the C282Y mutation appears to be the prevailing cause of clinically overt genetic haemochromatosis. This finding has implications both for the evaluation of patients with iron overload disorders and for the strategy in future population screening surveys.	14703688
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of HFE gene mutations in Iranian beta-thalassaemia minor patients.	European journal of haematology	2003	2.54	Beta-thalassaemia minor (BTM) alone does not lead to iron overload, however, some gene modifiers and acquired causes are reported. When it is inherited together with a mutation in the HFE (HLA-H) gene associated with hereditary haemochromatosis, iron overload may ensue. To analyse the relationship between iron status and HFE mutations in Iranian BTM patients, we compared the frequency of the C282Y and H63D HFE mutations and ferritin level in a group of BTM patients from the National Thalassaemia Transfusion and Care Centre with that of healthy individuals. Ninety-three (56 females) documented BTM cases and 104 (54 females) controls were enrolled in the study. Serum ferritin level was measured in all subjects by immuno-radiometric assay and HFE genotypes were determined using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified HFE gene fragment. Eighteen (19.4%) BTM patients vs. 12 (11.5%) controls were H63D heterozygotes, while there were three (3.2%) cases and three (2.9%) controls with H63D homozygosity. All three C282Y mutations were found in BMT patients with one of them being a compound heterozygote. A significant difference was observed in the total number of HFE mutations in favour of BTM patients over the controls (P < 0.05, OR = 2.064). The H63D and C282Y allele frequencies were 12.9 and 1.61 in patients and 8.65 and 0 in controls, respectively. The mean ferritin level in cases with HFE mutations showed no significant difference from that of the patients without mutations (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that HFE mutations C282Y and H63D are more frequent in Iranian BTM patients than in the normal population, causing no significant changes in serum ferritin level.	14703689
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic polymorphisms associated with thrombophilia and vascular disease in women with unexplained late intrauterine fetal death: a multicenter study.	Journal of the Society for Gynecologic Investigation	2004	0.5	We determined whether gene polymorphisms associated with thrombophilia and vascular disease as etiologic factors were involved in the pathogenesis of pregnancy-associated complications. We conducted a multicenter case-control study in which we studied 94 women with late unexplained intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) and 94 healthy women with at least one uncomplicated full-term pregnancy and no history of IUFD. We obtained blood samples from all subjects and analyzed their DNA for 12 common polymorphisms of thrombophilic and vascular genes (factor V Leiden, factor V H1299R, prothrombin G20210A, factor XIII V34L, MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, beta-fibrinogen-455 G to A, PAI-1 4G/5G, GPIIIa L33P, HFE C282Y, apolipoprotein B R3500Q, and apolipoprotein E2/E3/E4). We found no significant association between any of the polymorphisms investigated and IUFD. Subgroup analyses involving various combinations of polymorphisms and in which gestational age and fetal weight were corrected for also showed no significant results. Our data represent the largest study to date with respect to thrombophilic and vascular gene polymorphisms in IUFD. In accordance with others, we challenge the importance of thrombophilic and vascular gene polymorphisms in the pathogenesis of this condition.	14706682
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for hemochromatosis: patients with liver disease, families, and populations.	Current gastroenterology reports	2004	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common autosomal- recessive disorder of iron overload usually occurring in individuals who are homozygous for a C282Y mutation in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene. Current screening methods can detect affected individuals early in disease pathogenesis, enabling early institution of effective treatment that can restore normal life expectancy. Phenotypic screening of adults using transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels identifies the majority of individuals who develop iron overload. HFE genotyping, when combined with serum biochemical measurements, has reduced reliance on liver biopsy as a diagnostic tool and is the preferred initial screening modality for families with an affected individual. Genetic testing has altered previously held views regarding the high level of penetrance of the disease. Although the majority of C282Y homozygotes develop increased body iron stores, end-organ damage occurs much less frequently than previously thought. Screening is recommended in high-risk groups and in those with a high index of clinical suspicion. Opportunistic screening during routine health assessments may also be recommended. However, large-scale screening of the average-risk population is not recommended on the basis of current evidence.	14720453
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The 16189 variant of mitochondrial DNA occurs more frequently in C282Y homozygotes with haemochromatosis than those without iron loading.	Journal of medical genetics	2004	5.65	Patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) are usually homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. They have variable expression of iron overload and present with a variety of complications, including liver disease, diabetes, arthropathy, fatigue, and cardiomyopathy. The mitochondrial 16189 variant is associated with diabetes, dilated cardiomyopathy, and low body fat at birth, and might contribute to genetic predisposition in further multifactorial disorders. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of the 16189 variant in a range of patients with haemochromatosis, who had mutations in the HFE gene. Blood DNA was analysed for the presence of the 16189 variant in British, French, and Australian C282Y homozygotes and controls, with known iron status, and in birth cohorts. The frequency of the mitochondrial 16189 variant was found to be elevated in individuals with haemochromatosis who were homozygous for the C282Y allele, compared with population controls and with C282Y homozygotes who were asymptomatic (42/292 (14.4%); 102/1186 (8.6%) (p = 0.003); and 2/64 (3.1%) (p = 0.023), respectively). Iron loading in C282Y homozygotes with HH was exacerbated by the presence of the mitochondrial 16189 variant.	14729817
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis: a Neolithic adaptation to cereal grain diets.	Medical hypotheses	2008	1.14	The Neolithic period in Europe marked the transition from a hunter-gatherer diet rich in red meat to an iron-reduced cereal grain diet. This dietary shift likely resulted in an increased incidence of iron deficiency anemia, especially in women of reproductive age. I propose that hereditary hemochromatosis and in particular the common HFE C282Y mutation may represent an adaptation to decreased dietary iron in cereal grain-based Neolithic diets. Both homozygous and heterozygous carriers of the HFE C282Y mutation have increased iron stores and therefore possessed an adaptive advantage under Neolithic conditions. An allele age estimate places the origin of the HFE C282Y mutation in the early Neolithic period in Northern Europe and is thus consistent with this hypothesis. The lower incidence of this mutation in other agrarian regions (the Mediterranean and Near East) may be due to higher dietary intakes of the iron uptake cofactor vitamin C in those regions. The HFE C282Y mutation likely only became maladaptive in the past several centuries as dietary sources of iron and vitamin C improved in Northern Europe.	17689879
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Penetrance of the C28Y/C282Y genotype of the HFE gene.	Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology	2007	2.2	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common genetic disease caused by accumulation of iron in the body. Most cases are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, but only a minority of homozygotes will ever suffer from clinical hemochromatosis. Estimates of the penetrance of the C282Y/C282Y genotype vary greatly. The purpose of this study was to estimate the penetrance using a stringent definition, i.e. liver cirrhosis. The results from previous phenotypic population screening for hereditary hemochromatosis were combined with findings in hospital databases in order to estimate the number of C282Y homozygotes with and without liver cirrhosis in a Norwegian county. The penetrance of the C282Y/C282Y genotype was estimated as the fraction of C282Y homozygotes with liver cirrhosis. We also calculated the expected number of male C282Y homozygotes with liver cirrhosis using figures for age-specific accumulated risk. The prevalence of liver cirrhosis in male homozygotes is between 3.4% and 5.0%. This figure is compatible with an accumulated risk of liver cirrhosis that increases from 0.2% at 35 years to about 10% at 65 years of age. In female homozygotes, the prevalence of liver cirrhosis is 0.3%. A small but significant number of Norwegian male C282Y homozygotes will contract liver cirrhosis if their hemochromatosis is not diagnosed and treated in time. The penetrance is much lower in women than in men.	17710673
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Non HFE related hereditary haemochromatosis.	The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India	2014	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is manifested as iron overload in different organs due to homozygosity of a single autosomal mutation. Two different mutations C282Y and H63D in the HFE gene have been associated with hereditary hemochromatosis cases. This disease is seen in northern european populations, but in India it is a rare disease. We report a young male with severe abnormalty of liver functions due to Non HFE related Hereditary Hemochromatosis.	25327073
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Survey of Hfe Gene C282Y Mutation in Turkish Beta-Thalassemia Patients and Healthy Population: A Preliminary Study.	Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology	2014	0.5	This study was planned in order to determine the effect of C282Y mutation in development of secondary hemochromatosis in beta-thalassemia patients and to determine the prevalence and allele frequency of this mutation in a healthy control group. Eighty-seven children and young adults (46 males and 41 females; mean age: 15.6±6.1 years, range: 3-30 years) with beta-thalassemia major (BTM) and 13 beta-thalassemia intermedia (BTI) patients (6 males and 7 females; mean age: 19.6±3.5 years, range: 13-26 years) were included in the study. The control group comprised 100 healthy blood donors. Neither heterozygous nor homozygous HFE gene C282Y mutation was detected in patients with BTM or BTI, or in control group. The C282Y mutation, which is supposed to be responsible for the majority of hereditary hemochromatosis, was not found to have a role in the development of hemochromatosis in beta-thalassemia patients and was not detected in a healthy Turkish population. However, research on larger cohorts of individuals is required in order to determine the exact prevalence of the HFE gene mutation in Turkish populations from diverse ethnic origins and whether it would have an impact on iron loading in thalassemic populations.	25330520
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	When and how should we screen for hereditary hemochromatosis?	Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme	2003	2.95	Hemochromatosis is the clinical expression of iron overload and occurs as hereditary and secondary variants. In hereditary hemochromatosis, an inborn error in iron metabolism results in excess absorption of dietary iron, which gradually accumulates in the liver, pancreas, and heart. The most common form of hereditary hemochromatosis is related to homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Early diagnosis is essential because hereditary hemochromatosis is common, severe, and treatable. Early manifestations consist of asthenia, arthralgia, and serum transferrin saturation elevation. The C282Y mutation should be looked for to confirm the diagnosis in the patient and family members. Measurement of serum transferrin saturation followed by genetic testing in individuals with values above 45% is a reasonable screening strategy.	12951308
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations an Apulian population: allele frequencies.	European journal of epidemiology	2003	7.11	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive trait regarding iron metabolism frequently found in Caucasian populations. The C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, held responsible for HH, has been identified as the major genetic basis for the phenotypic expression of HH whereas two additional mutations of the HFE H63D and S65C gene appear to be associated with a milder form of HH. A high allele frequency of C282Y and H63D has been reported in Northern European populations. In Italy, the overall allele frequency was 0.5% for the C282Y mutation, 12.6% for the H63D mutation and 1.1% for the S65C mutation. In this study, we evaluated the allele frequency of the three principal HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D, S65C) together with eight additional mutations (V53M, H63H, Q127H, E168Q, E168stop, W169stop, V59M, Q238P) in 500 healthy Apulian subjects. No subject homozygous for the C282Y mutation was found while 3% of subjects were heterozygous for this mutation. Heterozygosity and homozygosity for the H63D mutation were 26 and 1%, respectively. Only five subjects were heterozygous for the S65C mutation. Overall, the allele frequency was 1.5% for C282Y, 14% for H63D, 0.5% for S65C and 0% for the other mutations. The transferrin saturation (TS) was significantly higher in subjects heterozygous for the H63D mutations with respect to subjects with a normal genotype, though all were within the normal range. No statistically significant difference in the allele frequency was noted in the Apulian population compared to that in Northern and Southern Italy.	12952143
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis and alcoholic liver disease.	Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)	2003	0.5	The close association of excessive alcohol consumption and clinical expression of hemochromatosis has been of widespread interest for many years. In most populations of northern European extraction, more than 90% of patients with overt hemochromatosis are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Nevertheless, the strong association of heavy alcohol intake with the clinical expression of hemochromatosis remains. We (individually or in association with colleagues from our laboratories) have performed three relevant studies in which this association was explored. In the first, performed in 1975 before the cloning of the HFE gene, the frequency of clinical symptoms and signs was compared in patients with classical hemochromatosis who consumed 100 g or more of alcohol per day versus in nondrinkers or moderate drinkers who consumed less than 100 g of alcohol per day. The results showed no difference between the two groups except for features of complications of alcoholism in the first group, especially jaundice, peripheral neuritis, and hepatic failure. Twenty-five percent of those with heavy alcohol consumption showed histologic features of alcoholic liver disease (including cirrhosis) together with heavy iron overload. It was concluded that these patients had the genetic disease complicated by alcoholic liver disease. In the second study (2002), 206 subjects with classical HFE-associated hemochromatosis in whom liver biopsy had been performed were evaluated to quantify the contribution of excess alcohol consumption to the development of cirrhosis in hemochromatosis. Cirrhosis was approximately nine times more likely to develop in subjects with hemochromatosis who consumed more than 60 g of alcohol per day than in those who drank less than this amount. In the third study (2002), 371 C282Y-homozygous relatives of patients with HFE-associated hemochromatosis were assessed. Eleven subjects had cirrhosis on liver biopsy and four of these drank 60 g or more of alcohol per day. The reason why heavy alcohol consumption accentuates the clinical expression of hemochromatosis is unclear. Increased dietary iron or increased iron absorption is unlikely. The most likely explanation would seem to be the added co-factor effect of iron and alcohol, both of which cause oxidative stress, hepatic stellate cell activation, and hepatic fibrogenesis. In addition, the cumulative effects of other forms of liver injury may result when iron and alcohol are present concurrently. Clearly, the addition of dietary iron in subjects homozygous for hemochromatosis would be unwise.	12957297
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron as a co-morbid factor in nonhemochromatotic liver disease.	Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)	2003	0.5	Heavy iron overload, in both primary and secondary hemochromatosis, may cause fibrosis of parenchymal organs, especially the liver. The toxicity of iron is believed to involve increased oxidative stress, with iron-catalyzed production of reactive oxygen species causing oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Lesser degrees of hepatic iron deposition are also associated with, and seem to be risk factors for, certain nonhemochromatotic liver diseases. Porphyria cutanea tarda is associated with hepatic iron overload and responds to iron-reduction therapy. Results of recent studies have demonstrated high prevalences (about 60%-80%) of HFE gene mutations in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda. Chronic hepatitis C is another risk factor for porphyria cutanea tarda. Other recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of HFE gene mutations is increased in chronic viral hepatitis and that patients with chronic hepatitis C harboring especially the C282Y mutation are more likely to suffer from advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis and to do so at younger ages. A role for modest iron overload in increasing severity of alcohol-induced liver disease has been well established from results of experimental studies. However, it is currently unresolved whether mild-to-moderate hepatic iron deposition or heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation plays a role in human alcoholic liver disease or in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. There is persuasive evidence that iron reduction decreases insulin resistance, and it likely also decreases oxidative stress, two key pathogenic features of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Iron loading has also been described after portosystemic shunts and in end-stage liver disease.	12957298
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary spherocytosis associated with mutations in HFE gene.	Annals of hematology	2003	3.02	We report on a Spanish family in which three members of different generations were diagnosed with hereditary spherocytosis (HS). Additionally, one of them II-I (44-years-old), presented iron overload with hepatic deposit and needed treatment with periodic phlebotomies. The rest of the family members presented normal analytical values in iron metabolism. To investigate the presence of H63D and C282Y mutations in the HFE gene, patient II-I was found to be compound heterozygous and was the only family member presenting HS and this genetic condition in HFE. We propose a synergistic effect of HS and mutations in HFE as the cause of the iron deposits.	12961032
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations in the elderly.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Most individuals diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis have mutations in both copies of the HFE gene, with such mutations being common in populations of north European origin. The number of individuals currently diagnosed and treated for hemochromatosis is small relative to the number carrying two HFE mutations. Studies searching for undiagnosed hemochromatosis cases among disease cohorts have generally failed to find the number of cases that would be expected if disease were the commonest outcome for individuals with two C282Y HFE mutations. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that individuals with two HFE mutations would be under-represented in an elderly population because many would have died from disease caused by hemochromatosis before they reached old age. This is a cross-sectional study of elderly patients referred for full blood counts at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. We screened blood samples from 1,000 elderly men (aged 85 and over) and women (aged 89 and over) for the C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations of the HFE gene. We also analyzed any recent laboratory data relevant to signs of hemochromatosis. None of the ten possible genotypes was significantly under- or over-represented compared to the expected frequency calculated from the Hardy-Weinberg equation. Four C282Y homozygotes were found. There were few significant differences in the laboratory findings between the genotypes. Our data suggest that most people with HFE mutations survive to old age and do not suffer from signs of iron overload and hemochromatosis.	12972032
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A European allele map of the C282Y mutation of hemochromatosis: Celtic versus Viking origin of the mutation?	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	The aim of this new meta-analysis (to the end of 2002) is to compile the Y allele frequencies of the C282Y mutation of hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE gene) for 63 European populations, representing a total of 10,708 unrelated people concerning control samples. A new allele map of C282Y frequencies in Europe was constructed. The highest European frequencies are observed in the Celtic populations in Ireland, in the United Kingdom, and in France, but elevated frequencies are also observed in Scandinavia.	12972035
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Chemical chaperones reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and prevent mutant HFE aggregate formation.	The Journal of biological chemistry	2007	0.5	HFE C282Y, the mutant protein associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), fails to acquire the correct conformation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is targeted for degradation. We have recently shown that an active unfolded protein response (UPR) is present in the cells of patients with HH. Now, by using HEK 293T cells, we demonstrate that the stability of HFE C282Y is influenced by the UPR signaling pathway that promotes its degradation. Treatment of HFE C282Y-expressing cells with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a bile acid derivative with chaperone properties, or with the chemical chaperone sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA) impeded the UPR activation. However, although TUDCA led to an increased stability of the mutant protein, 4PBA contributed to a more efficient disposal of HFE C282Y to the degradation route. Fluorescence microscopy and biochemical analysis of the subcellular localization of HFE revealed that a major portion of the C282Y mutant protein forms intracellular aggregates. Although neither TUDCA nor 4PBA restored the correct folding and intracellular trafficking of HFE C282Y, 4PBA prevented its aggregation. These data suggest that TUDCA hampers the UPR activation by acting directly on its signal transduction pathway, whereas 4PBA suppresses ER stress by chemically enhancing the ER capacity to cope with the expression of misfolded HFE, facilitating its degradation. Together, these data shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in HFE C282Y-related HH and open new perspectives on the use of orally active chemical chaperones as a therapeutic approach for HH.	17626021
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE variants, APOE and Alzheimer's disease: findings from the population-based Rotterdam study.	Neurobiology of aging	2009	5.15	Iron is a reactive oxygen species and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a population-based cohort study, including 268 incident AD patients and 2079 control individuals, we investigated the influence of the HFE C282Y and H63D variants and the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE epsilon 4) allele on the incidence, and age at onset of AD. There was no significant difference in the frequency of HFE variants in AD patients compared to controls. There was no significant effect modification by the APOE epsilon 4 allele. The mean age at onset was earlier in H63D homozygotes compared to non-carriers of this variant, in men (76.9+/-3.2 compared to 82.2+/-1.7) and women (82.1+/-3.9 compared to 84.5+/-1.7). In addition, in APOE epsilon 4 carriers, the mean age at onset of AD was earlier in men homozygous for the H63D variant (73.2+/-2.1 versus 78.7+/-1.6, p=0.05). Our results suggest that HFE variants are not strong determinants of AD in the general population but may modify the age of onset.	17628213
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The relationship between iron overload and clinical characteristics in a Spanish cohort of 100 C282Y homozygous hemochromatosis patients.	Annals of hematology	2007	3.02	We studied the relationship between iron removed by venesection, sex, age, and clinical characteristics in a group of 100 Spanish probands with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), all C282Y homozygous in the HFE gene. Iron overload was higher in men than in women (P < 0.0001) and increased with age (P = 0.02). Forty-four patients presented with liver disease (28 had fibrosis-cirrhosis of the liver), 24 with diabetes, 18 with arthropathy, and 13/73 men with impotence. No clinical consequences of hemochromatosis were observed in 43 patients. The number of clinical complications was higher in men (P = 0.01) and increased with age (P = 0.006) and with the amount of iron removed (P < 0.0001). The amount of iron removed was significantly higher by univariate analysis in patients with liver disease (P < 0.0001), diabetes (P = 0.007), arthropathy (P = 0.006), and impotence (P = 0.003) than in patients without these complications. In the multivariant analysis, only liver disease maintained a significant relationship with the amount of iron removed (P < 0.0001). Diabetes and arthropathy were closely related with previous liver disease, and impotence appeared mainly in hemochromatosic men with diabetes and alcoholism.	17639389
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Relative contribution of iron genes, dysmetabolism and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the pathogenesis of altered iron regulation in HCV chronic hepatitis.	Haematologica	2007	6.67	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic hepatitis predisposes to iron overload, which negatively influences the prognosis of this infection. Since the underlying mechanisms of this iron overload are undefined, we analyzed the prevalence of altered iron parameters, and the relative contribution of viral, metabolic, and genetic factors in Italian patients. We studied the metabolic and biochemical characteristics of 143 previously untreated, biopsied patients with HCV who were not alcohol abusers. Hepatic iron was determined according to Deugnier, HFE genotype by restriction analysis, hepcidin, hemojuvelin, ferroportin-1, and transferrin receptor-2 mutations by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and sequencing. Increased transferrin saturation was observed in 20%, hyperferritinemia in 22%, and histological iron deposition in 32% of patients. Ferritin was independently correlated with iron stores and host metabolic parameters, whereas hepatic iron deposition was correlated with ferritin and histological severity of hepatitis. Sinusoidal iron deposition was associated with metabolic alterations, including body mass index, insulin resistance, and LDL cholesterol. Conversely, the prevalence of HFE mutations and serum ferritin values increased with the severity of steatosis. The prevalence of HFE and beta-globin mutations was not different from that of controls (31% and 2%, respectively). No tranferrin receptor-2, hemojuvelin, or ferroportin-1 mutations were detected, but two patients carried the -72C>T hepcidin promoter mutation. The C282Y HFE mutation, hepcidin and beta-globin mutations influenced iron stores. Both carriers of the -72C>T Hepcidin mutation had beta-thalassemia trait, moderate iron overload, and liver cirrhosis. Iron genes influence iron overload and steatosis development, but the major burden is related to HCV itself and host metabolic factors.	17640859
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Expression of hereditary hemochromatosis C282Y HFE protein in HEK293 cells activates specific endoplasmic reticulum stress responses.	BMC cell biology	2007	2.58	Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic disease associated with iron overload, in which individuals homozygous for the mutant C282Y HFE associated allele are at risk for the development of a range of disorders particularly liver disease. Conformational diseases are a class of disorders associated with the expression of misfolded protein. HFE C282Y is a mutant protein that does not fold correctly and consequently is retained in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). In this context, we sought to identify ER stress signals associated with mutant C282Y HFE protein expression, which may have a role in the molecular pathogenesis of HH. Vector constructs of Wild type HFE and Mutant C282Y HFE were made and transfected into HEK293 cell lines. We have shown that expression of C282Y HFE protein triggers both an unfolded protein response (UPR), as revealed by the increased GRP78, ATF6 and CHOP expression, and an ER overload response (EOR), as indicated by NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, C282Y HFE protein induced apoptotic responses associated with activation of ER stress. Inhibition studies demonstrated that tauroursodeoxycholic acid, an endogenous bile acid, downregulates these events. Finally, we found that the co-existence of both C282Y HFE and Z alpha 1-antitrypsin protein (the protein associated with the liver disease of Z alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency) expression on ER stress responses acted as potential disease modifiers with respect to each other. Our novel observations suggest that both the ER overload response (EOR) and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are activated by mutant C282Y HFE protein.	17650303
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutation and oxidative damage biomarkers in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and its relation to transfusional iron overload: an observational cross-sectional study.	BMJ open	2015	2.56	A relation between transfusional IOL (iron overload), HFE status and oxidative damage was evaluated. An observational cross-sectional study involving 87 healthy individuals and 78 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with and without IOL, seen at University Hospital of the Federal University of Ceará, Brazil, between May 2010 and September 2011. IOL was defined using repeated measures of serum ferritin ≥1000 ng/mL. Variations in the HFE gene were investigated using PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The biomarkers of oxidative stress (plasmatic malonaldehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) were determined by spectrophotometry. The HFE gene variations were identified in 24 patients (30.77%) and 5 volunteers (5.74%). The H63D variant was observed in 35% and the C282Y variant as heterozygous in 5% of patients with MDS with IOL. One patient showed double heterozygous variant (C282Y/H63D) and serum ferritin of 11,649 ng/mL. In patients without IOL, the H63D variant was detected in 29.34%. Serum MDA levels were highest in patients with MDS with IOL, with a significant difference when compared with patients without IOL and healthy volunteers, pointing to the relationship between IOL and oxidative stress. The GPx and SOD were also significantly higher in these patients, indicating that lipid peroxidation increase was followed by an increase in antioxidant capacity. Higher ferritin levels were observed in patients with HFE gene variation. 95.7% of patients with MDS with the presence of HFE gene variations had received more of 20 transfusions. We observed a significant increase in MDA levels in patients with MDS and IOL, suggesting an increased lipid peroxidation in these patients. The accumulation of MDA alters the organisation of membrane phospholipids, contributing to the process of cellular degeneration. Results show that excess iron intensifies the process of cell damage through oxidative stress. Local Ethics Committee (licence 150/2009).	25841232
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The association between the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms of HFE gene and the risk of Parkinson's disease: A meta-analysis.	Neuroscience letters	2015	2.11	Impaired brain iron homeostasis has been considered as an important mechanism in Parkinson's diseases (PD). There are indications that C282Y and H63D polymorphisms of HFE genes involved in iron metabolism might contribute to the pathogenesis of PD in some cases. However, the investigation of the relationship between PD and the two polymorphisms had produced contradictory results. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms of HFE in PD susceptibility. PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were systematically searched to identify relevant researches. The strict selection criteria and exclusion standard were applied. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations. A fixed-effect or random-effect model was selected, depending on the results of the heterogeneity test. Fifteen studies were included in the meta-analysis (eight studies with 1631 cases and 4548 controls for C282Y; seven studies with 1192 cases and 4065 controls for H63D). For the C282Y polymorphism, significant associations were observed in the Recessive model (YY vs CY+CC: OR=0.22, 95% CI=0.09-0.57, P=0.002). This indicated that the C282Y polymorphism in HFE might be a potential protective factor for PD. However, no significant associations were found for any genetic model for the H63D polymorphism, suggesting that the H63D polymorphism might not be associated with PD.	25863172
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of HFE-codon 63/282 (H63D/C282Y) gene variants in mexican mestizos. Blood donors and patients with hereditary hemochromatosis.	Archives of medical research		2.22	The prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) (H63D/C282Y) gene variants in Mexico is unknown. Using amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction, an analysis of HFE-codon 63/282 (H63D/C282Y) gene variants was performed in a group of 153 Mexican mestizo blood donors and six individuals with familial iron overload. In normal blood donors, three heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation (2.0%) were found, whereas 18 heterozygotes and one homozygote for the H63D mutation (11.8% and 0.6%, respectively) were identified; there was one compound heterozygote for the C282Y/H63D mutation. These data resulted in allele frequencies of 0.013 (+/-0. 2%, alpha = 0.05) and 0.062 (+/-0.9%, alpha = 0.05), respectively, for these two mutations, results similar to those found in whites. In the six patients with the HH phenotype, two were found to be heterozygous for C282Y and one heterozygous for H63D; three individuals with HH had no gene mutations. Two heterozygous HH individuals were found to have iron overload associated with other conditions: one heterozygous for C282Y infected with HIV, and another heterozygous for H63D with heterozygous beta-thalassemia. The prevalence of C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations in Mexican mestizos is similar to that found in other populations. In addition, other gene mutations responsible for HH in the Mexican mestizo population should be investigated, because, in three of six individuals with the HH phenotype, neither of the two mutations was recorded.	11068087
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis in a patient with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia.	Blood	2000	11.84	Herein is described the case of a young woman presenting with iron overload and macrocytosis. The initial diagnosis was hereditary hemochromatosis. Severe anemia developed after a few phlebotomies, and she was also found to have congenital dyserythropoietic anemia that, though not completely typical, resembled type II. Only genetic testing allowed the definition of the coexistence of the 2 diseases, both responsible for the iron overload. This report points out the need to consider congenital dyserythropoietic anemia in patients with hemochromatosis and unexplained macrocytosis and, conversely, to check for the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia and severe iron overload. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in a patient affected by congenital dyserythropoietic anemia.	11071669
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Interactions of the ectodomain of HFE with the transferrin receptor are critical for iron homeostasis in cells.	FEBS letters	2000	3.52	Expression of wild type HFE reduces the ferritin levels of cells in culture. In this report we demonstrate that the predominant hereditary hemochromatosis mutation, C282Y(2) HFE, does not reduce ferritin expression. However, the second mutation, H63D HFE, reduces ferritin expression to a level indistinguishable from cells expressing wild type HFE. Further, two HFE cytoplasmic domain mutations engineered to disrupt potential signal transduction, S335M and Y342C, were functionally indistinguishable from wild type HFE in this assay, as was soluble HFE. These results implicate a role for the interaction of HFE with the transferrin receptor in lowering cellular ferritin levels.	11078891
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	C282Y mutation and hepatic iron status in hepatitis C and cryptogenic cirrhosis.	Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine	2000	2.63	Increased iron deposition in liver is seen in both primary and secondary hemochromatosis. However, it is not uncommon to see significant iron deposition in a liver biopsy, explant, or autopsy specimen without any significant clinical risk factor. Because of the discovery of the candidate gene (HFE) for hereditary hemochromatosis, we may now be able to screen high-risk patient populations for the abnormal mutation (C282Y). In this study we analyzed the livers of 50 transplant patients with a diagnosis of either hepatitis C cirrhosis or cryptogenic cirrhosis for the prevalence of the more common C282Y mutation of the HFE gene and correlated the findings to hepatic iron concentration. Of the 26 cases of hepatitis C cirrhosis, 3 were found to be heterozygous for the C282Y mutation. Of the 22 cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis, 1 was found to be heterozygous for the C282Y mutation. Stainable iron was increased in hepatitis C cirrhosis (76.9%) as compared to cryptogenic cirrhosis (50%) (P =. 05). Of the 3 heterozygotes with hepatitis C cirrhosis, 2 showed hepatic iron concentrations of 3+ and 4+, and 1 showed 1+. We conclude that patients with hepatitis C have an increased tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, and mutations in the HFE gene play a minor role in hepatic accumulation of iron in these patients.	11079015
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Premalignant lesions and hepatocellular carcinoma on non cirrhotic liver overloaded with iron].	Gastroenterologie clinique et biologique	2000	0.5	A 68-year old mildly obese Caucasian man underwent hepatic resection for multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma which had developed in the left lobe of a non-cirrhotic liver. The only risk factors found were heavy drinking, smoking, and serum markers of hepatitis B virus without virus genome in hepatocytes. The non tumoral liver was mildly fibrotic and iron overloaded (hepatic iron index: 1.6) with three types of iron-free lesions: (i) periportal clear hepatocyte foci, (ii) hyperplastic nodules and (iii) dysplastic or neoplastic nodules with well to moderately-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. The genetic investigation was negative for the C282Y and the H63D mutations of the HFE gene. This observation illustrates the multistep process of carcinogenesis in the non-cirrhotic liver and raises the question of i) the origin of this iron overload possibly linked to insulin resistance syndrome and ii) the role of iron as a co-carcinogen.	11084432
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Asymptomatic hemochromatosis subjects: genotypic and phenotypic profiles.	Blood	2000	11.84	Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) by means of transferrin saturation (TS) levels has been advocated and will identify many patients who are asymptomatic. The purposes of this study were (1) to determine HFE genotypes among asymptomatic HHC patients and correlate this profile with the degree of iron overload and (2) to evaluate the relationship between mobilized iron (mob Fe), age, serum ferritin (SF), and quantitative hepatic iron (QHI) in this population. One hundred twenty-three asymptomatic HHC patients were evaluated; all had quantitative phlebotomy to determine mob Fe and genotyping for C282Y and H63D mutations. Liver biopsies with QHI determinations were performed on 72 of the 123 patients. Of the entire group, 60% were homozygous for C282Y, and 13% were compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D). Among asymptomatic patients, the prevalence of homozygous C282Y is lower compared with previous studies that include clinically affected patients. Of those patients with more than 4 g mob Fe, 77% were homozygous C282Y. Asymptomatic patients with lower iron burdens frequently had genotypes other than homozygous C282Y. There was no correlation between age and mob Fe in these patients; however, there was a correlation between mob Fe and both SF (r = 0.68) and QHI (r = 0.75). In conclusion, asymptomatic patients with moderate iron overload had a different genotypic profile than was seen in advanced iron overload. The significance of identifying patients with modest degrees of iron loading, who may not be homozygous for C282Y, must be addressed if routine TS screening is to be implemented.

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Interaction between haemochromatosis and transferrin receptor genes in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Oncology	2000	2.15	In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) iron has been implicated as a risk factor primarily in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) and cirrhosis. The wild-type HH (HFE) protein complexes with the transferrin receptor (TFR), and two HFE mutations (Cys282Tyr and His63Asp) have been found to increase the affinity of the TFR for transferrin resulting in an increased cellular uptake of iron. In previous studies we found an interaction between HFE and TFR genotypes in multiple myeloma and breast and colorectal carcinomas. In the present investigation we have studied HFE and TFR genotypes in 54 Swedish patients with HCC, using DNA from archival samples of paraffin wax blocks. The same HFE-TFR interaction as in the previously studied neoplastic disorders was found. Individuals carrying the HFE282Tyr allele (homo- and heterozygotes) in combination with homozygosity for the TFR Ser allele showed an increased risk for HCC (OR = 3.5; 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.3-9.3), which was further increased in HFE Tyr homozygotes and compound (Tyr/Asp) heterozygotes in combination with TFR 142Ser homozygosity (OR = 17.2; 95% CI = 1.8-168.9). The presence of liver cirrhosis could only be assessed in part of the patient material. In patients with verified liver cirrhosis the risk figures were substantially increased: for HFE 282 Tyr carriers in combination with TFR 142 Ser/Ser OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 2.0-25.5 and for HFE 282Tyr homozygotes and compound heterozygotes in combination with TFR 142Ser homozygosity, OR = 62.8; 95% CI = 6.1-642.5.	11096344
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Non-classical hereditary hemochromatosis in Portugal: novel mutations identified in iron metabolism-related genes.	Annals of hematology	2009	3.02	The most frequent genotype associated with Hereditary hemochromatosis is the homozygosity for C282Y, a common HFE mutation. However, other mutations in HFE, transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2), hemojuvelin (HJV) and hepcidin (HAMP) genes, have also been reported in association with this pathology. A mutational analysis of these genes was carried out in 215 Portuguese iron-overloaded individuals previously characterized as non-C282Y or non-H63D homozygous and non-compound heterozygous. The aim was to determine the influence of these genes in the development of iron overload phenotypes in our population. Regarding HFE, some known mutations were found, as S65C and E277K. In addition, three novel missense mutations (L46W, D129N and Y230F) and one nonsense mutation (Y138X) were identified. In TFR2, besides the I238M polymorphism and the rare IVS5 -9T-->A mutation, a novel missense mutation was detected (F280L). Concerning HAMP, the deleterious mutation 5'UTR -25G-->A was found once, associated with Juvenile Hemochromatosis. In HJV, the A310G polymorphism, the novel E275E silent alteration and the novel putative splicing mutation (IVS2 +395C-->G) were identified. In conclusion, only a few number of mutations which can be linked to iron overload was found, revealing their modest contribution for the development of this phenotype in our population, and suggesting that their screening in routine diagnosis is not cost-effective.	18762941
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Role of liver biopsy in the diagnosis of hepatic iron overload in the era of genetic testing.	American journal of clinical pathology	2002	2.28	We studied hepatic iron overload (HIOL) patterns in 32 patients who underwent liver biopsies and testing for HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D). Iron-stained biopsy specimens were examined for patterns of iron deposits: hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) pattern or non-HH pattern. Visual iron grade based on amount of cellular and lobular iron was evaluated. We found the HH pattern in 17 biopsy specimens (53%) and the non-HH pattern in 6 specimens (19%). HH with superimposed non-HH was noted in 9 cases (28%). In 25 patients with HFE mutations, HH alone and combined with non-HH patterns was noted in 22 specimens (88%). Visual iron grade correlated approximately with the hepatic iron index. Heavy HIOL was noted in C282Y homozygotes and 1 patient with cirrhosis without either HFE mutation. Mild steatohepatitis was found in 21 specimens (66%); it was associated with the non-HH pattern in 80% (12/15) and the HH pattern in 62% (16/26) of cases. Liver biopsy can identify pattern and grade of HIOL and associated pathology for diagnosis and management of patients with abnormal iron studies and elevated liver function test results. Genetic tests for HFE mutations and liver biopsies are complementary in the workup of these patients.	12109859
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic testing for haemochromatosis in patients with chondrocalcinosis.	Annals of the rheumatic diseases	2002	12.38	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is the most common lethal monogenic human disease, affecting roughly 1 in 300 white northern Europeans. Homozygosity for the C282Y polymorphism within the HFE gene causes more than 80% of cases, with compound heterozygosity of the C282Y and H63D polymorphism also increasing susceptibility to disease. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in the disease, and to assess the risk of HH in heterozygotes for the C282Y polymorphism. 128 patients were recruited because of either radiographic chondrocalcinosis (at least bicompartmental knee disease or joints other than the knee involved) or CPPD pseudogout. Genotyping of the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations was performed using PCR/SSP and genotypes for the C282Y polymorphism confirmed by PCR/RFLP. Historical white European control data were used for comparison. Two previously undiagnosed C282Y homozygotes (1.6%), and 16 C282Y heterozygotes (12.5%), including four (3.1%) C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes were identified. This represents a significant overrepresentation of C282Y homozygotes (relative risk 3.4, p=0.037), but the number of heterozygotes was not significantly increased. At a cost per test of pound1 for each subject, screening all patients with chondrocalcinosis using the above ascertainment criteria costs only pound64 for each case of haemochromatosis identified, clearly a highly cost effective test given the early mortality associated with untreated haemochromatosis. Routine screening for haemochromatosis in patients with appreciable chondrocalcinosis is recommended.	12117686
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic testing for HFE hemochromatosis in Australia: the value of testing relatives of simple heterozygotes.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2002	3.32	It is unclear whether screening of relatives of C282Y and H63D heterozygotes (other than compound heterozygotes) for hemochromatosis will detect sufficient numbers of cases to justify introduction of this screening strategy. Conditional probabilities were determined using published Australian allele frequencies and penetrance data to determine the detection rate of hemochromatosis by testing the siblings and offspring of heterozygotes (subjects with only one HFE mutation). The number of individuals who are at risk of developing increased body iron stores because of HFE mutations is substantially higher (1 in 80) than previously estimated. In addition, 33% of the Australian population are heterozygous for either C282Y or H63D. Based on population estimates, the relative risk to the offspring of C282Y and H63D heterozygotes of developing increased iron stores is 4.1 and 1.5, respectively, while the relative risk to each sibling is 2.3 and 1, respectively. The risk of developing clinical features of hemochromatosis or hepatic fibrosis is likely to be substantially lower. Although the detection rate from testing the families of unaffected heterozygotes is low, this can be justified as a clinically useful screening strategy. At the present time this strategy should be restricted to first-degree relatives of heterozygotes. Further studies are recommended to determine if cascade genetic screening is a cost-effective alternative to general population screening.	12121511
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	The molecular basis of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency in Australian patients: genotype-phenotype correlations and response to treatment.	Human mutation	2002	5.09	Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is the most common cause of homocystinuria. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and common clinical features are: dislocation of the optic lens, osteoporosis, mental retardation, and thromboembolism. We determined the molecular basis of CBS deficiency in 36 Australian patients from 28 unrelated families, using direct sequencing of the entire coding region of the CBS gene. The G307S and I278T mutations were the most common mutations. They were present in 19% and 18% of independent alleles, respectively. In total, seven novel and 20 known mutations were detected. Of those, the two novel missense mutations (C109R and G347S), as well as two known missense mutations (L101P and N228K), were expressed in E. Coli. All mutant proteins completely lacked catalytic activity. Furthermore, we studied the correlation between genotype and the biochemical response to pyridoxine treatment in the patients of whom 13 were pyridoxine responsive, 21 were non-responsive, and two were partially responsive. The G307S mutation always resulted in a severe non-responsive phenotype, whereas I278T resulted in a milder B6 responsive phenotype. From our results, we were also able to establish three other mild mutations: P49L, R369C, and V371M.	12124992
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) and HFE mutational analysis in non-C282Y iron overload: identification of a novel TfR2 mutation.	Blood	2002	11.84	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is classically associated with a Cys282Tyr (C282Y) mutation of the HFE gene. Non-C282Y HH is a heterogeneous group accounting for 15% of HH in Northern Europe. Pathogenic mutations of the transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) gene have been identified in 4 Italian pedigrees with the latter syndrome. The goal of this study was to perform a mutational analysis of the TfR2 and HFE genes in a cohort of non-C282Y iron overload patients of mixed ethnic backgrounds. Several sequence variants were identified within the TfR2 gene, including a homozygous missense change in exon 17, c2069 A-->C, which changes a glutamine to a proline residue at position 690. This putative mutation was found in a severely affected Portuguese man and 2 family members with the same genotype. In summary, pathologic TfR2 mutations are present outside of Italy, accounting for a small proportion of non-C282Y HH.	12130528
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Fluorescent multicolor multiplex homogeneous assay for the simultaneous analysis of the two most common hemochromatosis mutations.	Analytical biochemistry	2002	2.24	We report the development of a qualitative fluorescent multiplex homogeneous assay designed for the detection of the two most common hemochromatosis mutations using dual-labeled fluorescent probes. The assay is able to detect four allelic variants in a single closed tube using a single thermocycling protocol. The procedure combines the great sensitivity of the polymerase chain reaction, the specificity provided by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization using the 5(') nuclease assay format, and the higher throughput of a multicolor fluorescence detection procedure. Genomic DNA was prepared from whole blood specimens using standard procedures. Following DNA sample preparation, two regions of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) including the H63D and C282Y mutations were coamplified and detected in real-time by four different fluorescently labeled allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. Assay specificity was demonstrated by a blind methods comparison study that included 37 DNA samples from individuals with a known HFE genotype. Results from the study showed that the multicolor multiplex HFE assay unambiguously classified all possible genotypes for the HFE gene C282Y and H63D mutations(1). This technique will be useful for research and molecular diagnostic laboratories and can be easily adapted for the detection of other single nucleotide polymorphisms.	12137778
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Identification of novel mutations in hemochromatosis genes by targeted next generation sequencing in Italian patients with unexplained iron overload.	American journal of hematology	2016	5.0	"""Hereditary hemochromatosis, one of the commonest genetic disorder in Caucasians, is mainly associated to homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, which is highly prevalent (allele frequency up to near 10% in Northern Europe) and easily detectable through a widely available """"first level"""" molecular test. However, in certain geographical regions like the Mediterranean area, up to 30% of patients with a HH phenotype has a negative or non-diagnostic (i.e. simple heterozygosity) test, because of a known heterogeneity involving at least four other genes (HAMP, HJV, TFR2, and SLC40A1). Mutations in such genes are generally rare/private, making the diagnosis of atypical HH essentially a matter of exclusion in clinical practice (from here the term of """"non-HFE"""" HH), unless cumbersome traditional sequencing is applied. We developed a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based test targeting the five HH genes, and applied it to patients with clinically relevant iron overload (IO) and a non-diagnostic first level genetic test. We identified several mutations, some of which were novel (i.e. HFE W163X, HAMP R59X, and TFR2 D555N) and allowed molecular reclassification of """"non-HFE"""" HH clinical diagnosis, particularly in some highly selected IO patients without concurring acquired risk factors. This NGS-based """"second level"""" genetic test may represent a useful tool for molecular diagnosis of HH in patients in whom HH phenotype remains unexplained after the search of common HFE mutations."""	26799139
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of HFE (hemochromatosis gene) mutations in unselected male patients with type 2 diabetes.	The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine	2000	0.5	To assess the prevalence of mutations in the HFE (hemochromatosis) gene in unselected male patients with type 2 diabetes, we examined 220 white men without known diabetes and 220 age-matched white men with type 2 diabetes for mutations in the HFE gene. Nucleotide 845 (C282Y) and 187(H63D) alleles were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with lymphocyte DNA. The PCR products were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion. One of the 220 patients (0.45%) with diabetes was homozygous for the HFE 845A (C282Y) mutation and 25 (11.3%) were heterozygous for the same mutation, of whom 3 (1.3%) were compound heterozygotes also carrying the HFE 187G (H63D) mutation. These frequencies did not differ significantly from the control population without diabetes. There is no evidence that HFE mutations are found in excess in unselected male patients with type 2 diabetes, and there is no indication for a population-based search for an excess of these alleles in type 2 diabetes.	10695662
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical characteristics of type 2 diabetes in patients with mutations of HFE.	Diabetes & metabolism	2000	4.69	Genetic hemochromatosis (GH) is associated with two mutations of the HFE gene (Cys282Tyr and His63Asp). Heterozygosity for GH is associated with a mild increase in iron metabolism parameters, and increased iron stores are associated with abnormal glucose tolerance and decreased insulin sensitivity in the general population. We have previously shown that the frequency of the two HFE mutations is not increased in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, to assess whether the presence of HFE mutations modulates the clinical presentation of type 2 diabetes, we studied the clinical characteristics and iron metabolism indexes according to the presence of the two mutations in 266 patients with type 2 diabetes. The Cys282Tyr mutation and the His63Asp mutation were present in 9. 8% and 26% of the patients, respectively. Serum iron, transferrin saturation and ferritin concentrations were significantly increased in patients expressing either HFE mutations, compared to those without any mutation. There was no difference in the clinical characteristics in the two groups except that obesity was significantly less frequent in the patients with at least one mutation than in those without any mutation (27.6% vs 42.8%, p=0.02). This finding suggests that, in the absence of obesity, HFE mutations, through the insulin resistance associated with the increase in iron stores, may contribute to the onset of type 2 diabetes.	10705106
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations in coronary atherothrombotic disease.	Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas	2000	0.5	Although iron can catalyze the production of free radicals involved in LDL lipid peroxidation, the contribution of iron overload to atherosclerosis remains controversial. The description of two mutations in the HFE gene (Cys282Tyr and His63Asp) related to hereditary hemochromatosis provides an opportunity to address the question of the association between iron overload and atherosclerosis. We investigated the prevalence of HFE mutations in 160 survivors of myocardial infarction with angiographically demonstrated severe coronary atherosclerotic disease, and in 160 age-, gender- and race-matched healthy control subjects. PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by RsaI and BclI restriction enzyme digestion was used to determine the genotypes. The frequency of the mutant Cys282Tyr allele was identical among patients and controls (0.022; carrier frequency, 4.4%), whereas the mutant His63Asp allele had a frequency of 0.143 (carrier frequency, 27.5%) in controls and of 0.134 (carrier frequency, 24.5%) in patients. Compound heterozygotes were found in 2 of 160 (1.2%) controls and in 1 of 160 (0.6%) patients. The finding of a similar prevalence of Cys282Tyr and His63Asp mutations in the HFE gene among controls and patients with coronary atherothrombotic disease, indirectly questions the possibility of an association between hereditary hemochromatosis and atherosclerosis.	10719381
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Complete characterization of the 3' region of the human and mouse hereditary hemochromatosis HFE gene and detection of novel splicing forms.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	The human HFE gene was identified in 1996 as the gene whose mutations are responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis in most patients. Expression analysis by Northern blot indicated that the gene was approximately 4.1 kb in length. However, the cDNA reported was only 2716 bp. These results implied that at least 1.4 kb of the mRNA remained to be identified. In the present study, we detected several 3' EST clones while screening the genomic region of the gene in search of potential additional HFE mRNA sequences. Subsequent sequencing of these EST clones and RT-PCR experiments revealed that exon 7 of the HFE gene has, in fact, a length of 1944 bp and it presents two polyadenylation signals. The new human HFE exon 7 region has been screened in non-C282Y HH patients in search for new putative mutations. Mouse 3' RACE experiments also further extend the previously reported mouse HFE exon 6 sequence. Additionally, we report two novel end forms of the human HFE gene detected by 3' RACE experiments and several novel splicing forms identified in the HepG2 cell line.	11358357
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Transferrin receptor-2 (TFR2) mutation Y250X in Alabama Caucasian and African American subjects with and without primary iron overload.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	"""Most cases of hemochromatosis are associated with mutations of the HFE gene on Ch6p. In southern Italy and central Alabama, the percentages of patients with hemochromatosis who have """"atypical"""" HFE genotypes (defined as lack of C282Y homozygosity, C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity, or H63D homozygosity) are relatively great. A mutation of the transferrin receptor-2 gene (TFR2; exon 6, nt 750 C --> G, replaces TAC with stop signal TAG; Y250X) on Ch7q22 was recently identified in two Sicilian families with HFE mutation-negative hemochromatosis. We wanted to estimate the frequency of this mutation in persons from central Alabama. We evaluated Caucasian hemochromatosis probands with atypical HFE genotypes and African Americans with primary iron overload. We also studied control Caucasians, including persons of southern Italian/Sicilian heritage, and control African Americans. Analysis of genomic DNA was performed using a PCR-sequence-specific priming assay and positive control specimens from Sicilian hemochromatosis subjects heterozygous and homozygous for Y250X. Among Alabama subjects, this allele was not detected in 113 Caucasians, including 21 hemochromatosis probands with atypical HFE genotypes and 92 normal control subjects (including 27 of southern Italian/Sicilian descent). In African Americans, Y250X was not detected in 20 index cases with primary iron overload or in 274 unrelated control subjects. We conclude that Y250X is uncommon in Caucasians with hemochromatosis associated with atypical HFE genotypes, in African Americans with primary iron overload, and in the general Caucasian and African American population subgroups in central Alabama."""	11358388
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutation analysis of the transferrin receptor-2 gene in patients with iron overload.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Three mutations in the transferrin receptor-2 gene have recently been identified in four Sicilian families with iron overload who had a normal hemochromatosis gene, HFE (C. Camaschella, personal communication). To determine the extent to which mutations in the transferrin receptor-2 gene occur in other populations with iron overload, we have completely sequenced this gene in 17 whites, 10 Asians, and 8 African Americans with iron overload and a C282C/C282C HFE genotype, as well as 4 subjects without iron overload and homozygous for the mutant HFE C282Y genotype, 5 patients with iron overload and homozygous for the mutant HFE C282Y genotype, and 5 normal individuals. None of the individuals exhibited the Sicilian mutations, Y250X in exon 6, M172K in exon 4, and E60X in exon 2. One iron-overloaded individual of Asian descent exhibited a I238M mutation which was subsequently found to be a polymorphism present in the Asian population at a frequency of 0.0192. The presence of the I238M mutation was not associated with an increase in ferritin or transferrin saturation levels. Three silent polymorphisms were also identified, nt 1770 (D590D) and nt 1851 (A617A) and a polymorphism at nt 2255 in the 3' UTR. Thus, mutations in the transferrin receptor-2 gene were not responsible for the iron overload seen in our subjects.	11358389
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Transferrin receptor-2 gene and non-C282Y homozygous patients with hemochromatosis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	More than 80% of the patients affected by hereditary hemochromatosis, a common inherited iron disorder, are homozygotes for the 845G --> A (C282Y) mutation of the HFE gene. However, depending on the population, 10-20% of hereditary hemochromatosis can be linked either to other HFE genotypes, particularly the compound heterozygous state for C282Y and the 187 C --> G (H63D) mutation, or to mutations of new other genes. Recently, Camaschella et al. (Nat. Genet. 25, 14-15, 2000) identified a stop mutation (exon 6 nt 750 C --> T, Y250X) on the transferrin receptor-2 (TFR2) gene in two unrelated Sicilian families with hereditary hemochromatosis. The TFR2 gene is a transferrin receptor gene homologue that seems to be involved in iron metabolism. Moreover, one of the patients described by Camaschella et al. was a H63D homozygote. H63D homozygosity can be associated with various phenotypes from asymptomatic subjects to patients with a typical form of hereditary hemochromatosis. Thus, the Y250X mutation could be the molecular defect responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis in subjects with atypical HFE genotypes. We have searched for the Y250X mutation in 63 unrelated French subjects. Forty-three had a diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis based on classical criteria. This group included 12 H63D homozygotes, 3 C282Y heterozygotes, and 3 patients with none of the two most prevalent HFE mutants. These 18 patients had no other HFE sequence change and were subsequently subjected to DNA sequencing of the 15 last exons and flanking sequences of the TFR2 gene. The 25 remaining hereditary hemochromatosis patients who were tested for the Y250X mutant were compound heterozygotes for the C282Y and H63D mutations. Finally, we also tested for this TFR2 mutation 20 H63D homozygotes with milder manifestations of iron overload and no acquired cause of iron overload. None of the 63 tested subjects had the Y250X mutation. Concurrently, none of the 18 hereditary hemochromatosis patients who had their TFR2 gene sequenced had any deleterious mutation. Thus, TFR2 mutations are not responsible for hemochromatosis in non-C282Y homozygous patients of our area.	11358390

Screening to estimate the prevalence of HH was frequently performed among blood donors, not considering that carriers of the HH gene mutations may be present in higher proportion in this population. To examine the allele frequencies of the HH gene (HFE) point mutations, C282Y and H63D genotyping was carried out in 996 consecutive, first-time, and regular Hungarian blood donors by PCR-RFLP techniques. Iron parameters of the first-time donors and the identified C282Y heterozygotes and age, gender, and number of previous blood donation-matched wild-type donors were also determined. We were not able to demonstrate a significant increase in the frequency of C282Y and H63D alleles among regular blood donors, compared to first-time blood donors. However, there was a trend of higher C282Y allele frequency among women with higher number of previous blood donations (2.2 +/- 1.5% in female blood donors with 0-8 previous blood donations compared to 4.8 +/- 2.3% in women with more than 8 previous blood donations, P = 0.06). No detectable phenotypic differences were observed in serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation values between C282Y wild-type and heterozygous groups. However, the single identified C282Y homozygous male (age 21) showed definite signs of iron overload. Our observations suggest that the protective effect of C282Y heterozygosity against iron deficiency may be less significant than other environmental (e.g., iron-rich diet) or genetic factors.	11358395
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	APOC3, CETP, fibrinogen, and MTHFR are genetic determinants of carotid intima-media thickness in healthy men (the Stanislas cohort).	Clinical genetics	2001	3.89	The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) inter-individual variability and 16 polymorphisms of 11 genes associated with cardiovascular risk factors (genes among lipid and homocysteine metabolisms, blood viscosity, platelet aggregation, leukocyte adhesion and renin-angiotensin system). CIMT was measured by high resolution B-mode ultrasonography in an healthy population of 77 men and 84 women, aged 35-54 years and selected from a French Cohort: the Stanislas Cohort. The polymorphisms studied were genotyped by a multilocus approach. Statistical analyses were carried out by ANOVA, after adjustment of CIMT for age, body mass index, and smoking, and by multiple regression analyses. No association was found with APOB Thr71Ile, APOC3 -482C/T, -455T/C, GpIIIa P1A, AT1R 1166A/C, AGT Met235Thr, CBS Ile278Thr, SELE 98G/T, and SELE Ser128Arg, polymorphisms neither in men nor in women. Although, in women we did not find any association for APOC3 3206T/G, 3175C/G, 1100C/T, CETP Ile405Val, MTHFR 677C/T and fibrinogen -455G/A polymorphisms; in men these polymorphisms were associated with CIMT variability (p< or =0.01; p< or =0.05). The most interesting finding was that altogether these genes in men were able to explain a considerable part, 20.6%, of CIMT variability. Therefore, our study gives a new opportunity to understand CIMT variability.	11359462
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary haemochromatosis: only 1% of adult HFEC282Y homozygotes in South Wales have a clinical diagnosis of iron overload.	Human genetics	2002	5.14	In northern Europe, about 90% of patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) are homozygous for a single mutation (C282Y) of the HFEgene and approximately 1 in 150 people in the general population carries this genotype. However, the clinical significance of HFE mutations remains uncertain, as is the proportion of people homozygous for C282Y who will develop clinical symptoms leading to a diagnosis of HH. A systematic review of patients with HH over a 2-year period within a defined UK region has revealed that only 1.2% of adult C282Y homozygotes have been diagnosed with iron overload and received treatment. In those in whom body iron load could be estimated, only 51% has more than 4 g iron (the diagnostic threshold for iron overload).	12436244
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations and iron metabolism in Wilson's disease.	Liver	2002	0.5	There is increasing evidence for an interaction between iron and copper metabolism. Iron indices (ferritin, transferrin saturation [TS], serum iron), liver parameters, the prevalence and significance of C282Y and H63D HFE mutations were studied in 40 unrelated, Caucasian patients with Wilson's disease and 295 healthy controls. Due to specific treatment Wilson's disease was well controlled in all but one patient. The allele frequencies for the C282Y (11.3% vs. 6.2%) and the H63D (18.8% vs. 16.4%) mutation did not differ between patients with Wilson's disease and healthy controls. One patient with C282Y homozygous HH and Wilson's disease was identified showing progressive liver disease despite reasonable venesection and copper chelation therapy. No differences in iron indices and liver values were seen between HFE heterozygous and HFE wildtype patients with Wilson's disease. Higher serum ferritin levels were noticed in patients with Wilson's disease compared to healthy controls (149 +/- 26 microg/l vs. 87 +/- 8 microg/l; P < 0.03). It appears reasonable to assess iron indices in patients with Wilson's disease in order to detect iron overload. HFE mutations other than C282Y homozygosity seem to have no impact on iron indices and liver parameters as long as Wilson's disease is controlled.	12445172
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron and HFE or TfR1 mutations as comorbid factors for development and progression of chronic hepatitis C.	Journal of hepatology	2002	10.59	Recent evidence implicates iron as a comorbid factor for development of non-hemochromatotic liver diseases. Mutations or polymorphisms in the HFE gene or the TfR1 gene may influence the accumulation of iron in the liver or other tissues or may influence chronic viral hepatitis apart from effects on iron homeostasis. The aim of this study was to assess the role of hepatic iron, HFE and TfR1 variations on development and progression of chronic hepatitis C infection. We studied 119 consecutive patients with chronic hepatitis C, correlating clinical, laboratory, histopathological, and genetic data. Frequencies of genetic variations were compared with local and national controls. HFE mutations were more common in patients than controls (48% vs. 38%, P=0.04), and advanced degrees of fibrosis developed at younger ages in subjects with the C282Y mutation (38.6 vs. 46.5 years, P=0.03). Patients carrying C282Y had higher mean hepatic iron concentrations (P=0.02), hepatic iron indices (P<=0.0001), and hepatic fibrosis scores (P=0.01). Hepatic fibrosis was correlated with hepatic iron concentration (P=0.03). TfR1 polymorphisms bore no detectable relation to disease severity or response to therapy. Hepatic iron and HFE mutations are comorbid factors that increase development and progression of chronic hepatitis C.	12445428
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haptoglobin polymorphism and iron homeostasis.	Clinical chemistry	2002	7.46	There is a marked difference in the degree of expression of the homozygous C282Y HFE genotype that is associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. It has been reported that individuals with the haptoglobin 2-2 type manifest increased iron concentrations, including serum iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin. We studied 232 patients, 115 homozygous for the c.845G-->A (C282Y) mutation and 117 matched controls with the wild-type HFE genotype, for haptoglobin phenotypes. Haptoglobin types were determined by electrophoresis of the denatured protein. The HFE genotype was determined by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Ferritin and transferrin saturation were measured by standard methods. There was no relationship between haptoglobin type and ferritin concentration or transferrin saturation. The effect of haptoglobin type on iron homeostasis cannot account for the marked phenotypic variation that is seen in patients homozygous for the HFE C282Y mutation.	12446481
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Review article: haemochromatosis.	Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics	2002	6.32	Hereditary haemochromatosis is the prototype disease for primary iron overload. The disorder is very common, especially amongst subjects of Northern European extraction. It is characterized by an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and most cases are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Haemochromatosis is now recognized to be a complex genetic disease with probable significant environmental and genetic modifying factors. The early diagnosis of individuals at risk for the development of haemochromatosis is important, because survival and morbidity are improved if phlebotomy therapy is instituted before the development of cirrhosis. The cost-effectiveness and utility of large-scale screening for haemochromatosis have been questioned given that many individuals with the homozygous C282Y mutation do not have iron overload or end-organ damage. However, the use of phenotypic tests, such as serum transferrin-iron saturation, for initial screening avoids the problem of the identification of non-expressing homozygotes. Liver biopsy remains important in management to determine the presence or absence of cirrhosis, particularly amongst patients with serum ferritin levels greater than 1000 ng/mL or elevated liver enzymes. Those with non-HFE haemochromatosis who cannot be identified on genotypic testing should have a liver biopsy to establish diagnosis. Patients with end-stage liver disease may develop liver failure or primary liver cancer, and liver transplantation may be required. Liver transplantation for haemochromatosis is associated with a poorer outcome compared with other indications because of infections and cardiac complications.	12452931
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetics of haemochromatosis.	Lancet (London, England)	2002	0.5	After identification of the hereditary haemochromatosis gene HFE, and receipt of confirmation that most patients with the condition were homozygous for a single, founder mutation (C282Y), most assumed that C282Y would be a prevalent, highly penetrant mutation in a gene that plays a key part in the regulation of iron absorption and of whole-body iron homoeostasis. With carrier rates of between 10% and 15%, and a homozygote frequency of about one-in-150 in people of northern European descent, C282Y is certainly prevalent. However, it is not highly penetrant. The pronounced variation in phenotype in individuals with the same gene mutation has prompted the search for modifier genes at other loci, and for environmental factors that might affect expression of the condition. Progress in our understanding of how HFE regulates the absorption of dietary iron has been slow, but much can be learnt from the study of the rare instances of haemochromatosis that involve mutations in newly-identified iron-metabolism genes, such as TFR2--a transferrin receptor isoform--and ferroportin1/Ireg1/mtp1--an intestinal iron transporter. The availability of definitive information on penetrance and the identity of genetic modifiers will aid the debate on whether population screening for haemochromatosis should be undertaken or whether alternative strategies should be implemented to improve early detection.	12457803
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene HFE Cys282Tyr mutation analysis in a cohort of Northeast German hospitalized patients supports assumption of a North to South allele frequency gradient throughout Germany.	Clinical laboratory	2005	0.94	Hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common autosomal recessive disease in populations of Northern European ancestry. Population studies demonstrated highly variable frequencies of the HFE Cys282Tyr allele in various regions throughout Europe and decreasing allele frequencies from north to south. However, most of the German prevalence studies covered the central and southern regions of the country. The present study recruited 709 consecutive patients at the time of their admission to a Northeast German University Hospital Medical Department. Polymerase chain reaction-based assays were used to detect HFE Cys282Tyr and His63Asp alleles. Biochemical profiling consisting of transferrin saturation rate, and concentrations of ferritin, transferrin, and iron were performed in Cys282Tyr homozygotes and Cys282Tyr/His63Asp heterozygotes, respectively. Results were compared with previous German prevalence studies. Analysis of 709 Caucasian patients resulted in 650 (91.7%) homozygous HFE wild-type carriers, 55 (7.74%) Cys282Tyr heterozygotes, 4 (0.56%) Cys282Tyr homozygotes and 6 (0.85%) Cys282Tyr/His63Asp compound heterozygotes. The HFE Cys282Tyr allele frequency was 4.44%. Phenotypic markers of iron overload were elevated in one homozygote. We conclude that in contrast to previous hemochromatosis prevalence studies in Germany using blood donors or employees, the present study involving hospital patients estimated a HFE Cys282Tyr allele frequency of 4.44% and supports the emerging concept of an allele gradient decreasing from North to South within Germany.	16285477
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Porphyria cutanea tarda associated with Cys282Tyr mutation in HFE gene in hereditary hemochromatosis: a case report and review of the literature.	Cutis	2007	0.93	Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) typically presents with complaints of fragile skin, dorsal hand vesicles, erosions, and scars, and increased levels of uroporphyrins. A case of PCT caused by iron overload associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is reported. The laboratory workup revealed the patient was homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE (hemochromatosis) gene. The associated diagnosis of HH was critical because without early treatment, damage to vital organs and premature death could occur. This report highlights the important association of PCT with HH and reviews the role of key genetic and hormonal factors in iron regulation.	18189029
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron-overload-related disease in HFE hereditary hemochromatosis.	The New England journal of medicine	2008	0.5	Most persons who are homozygous for C282Y, the HFE allele most commonly asssociated with hereditary hemochromatosis, have elevated levels of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Diseases related to iron overload develop in some C282Y homozygotes, but the extent of the risk is controversial. We assessed HFE mutations in 31,192 persons of northern European descent between the ages of 40 and 69 years who participated in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study and were followed for an average of 12 years. In a random sample of 1438 subjects stratified according to HFE genotype, including all 203 C282Y homozygotes (of whom 108 were women and 95 were men), we obtained clinical and biochemical data, including two sets of iron measurements performed 12 years apart. Disease related to iron overload was defined as documented iron overload and one or more of the following conditions: cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated aminotransferase levels, physician-diagnosed symptomatic hemochromatosis, and arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. The proportion of C282Y homozygotes with documented iron-overload-related disease was 28.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18.8 to 40.2) for men and 1.2% (95% CI, 0.03 to 6.5) for women. Only one non-C282Y homozygote (a compound heterozygote) had documented iron-overload-related disease. Male C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin level of 1000 mug per liter or more were more likely to report fatigue, use of arthritis medicine, and a history of liver disease than were men who had the wild-type gene. In persons who are homozygous for the C282Y mutation, iron-overload-related disease developed in a substantial proportion of men but in a small proportion of women.	18199861
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hyperferritinemia in the Chinese and Asian community: a retrospective review of the University of British Columbia experience.	Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie	2008	0.5	Elevated serum ferritin is a common clinical finding. The etiology of hyperferritinemia in the Asia-Pacific population is less clear due to a low prevalence of known HFE mutations such as C282Y and H63D, as well as an increased prevalence of viral hepatitis and hereditary anemia. A retrospective case review of 80 patients of Asian ethnicity referred to three subspecialists in tertiary care teaching hospitals between January 1997 and March 2005 for assessment of hyperferritinemia was performed. Only four patients (5%) had iron overload on liver biopsy or quantitative phlebotomy. Forty-nine patients (61%) had secondary causes for their hyperferritinemia, of which 26 had liver disease; 16 of those patients also had viral hepatitis. Thirteen patients fulfilled criteria for the insulin resistance syndrome. Other causes included hematological disorders (n=10), malignancy (n=2) and inflammatory arthritis (n=2). Twenty-seven cases (34%) of unexplained hyperferritinemia were found. Of a total of 22 patients who underwent liver biopsy, significant iron deposition was found in one patient. Fifteen patients underwent C282Y and H63D genotyping, with two cases of H63D heterozygosity. Fourteen patients had first-degree relatives with hyperferritinemia. Three families were identified with more than two members affected, which is suggestive of a possible hereditary hyperferritinemia syndrome. Secondary causes of elevated ferritin in the Asian population, particularly liver disease, are common, but primary iron overload syndromes appear to be rare. In a significant proportion of patients, the etiology remains unexplained. The genetic basis for hyperferritinemia in Asians is poorly defined and requires further study.	18209779
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetics, Genetic Testing, and Management of Hemochromatosis: 15 Years Since Hepcidin.	Gastroenterology	2015	18.19	The discovery of hepcidin in 2000 and the subsequent unprecedented explosion of research and discoveries in the iron field have dramatically changed our understanding of human disorders of iron metabolism. Today, hereditary hemochromatosis, the paradigmatic iron-loading disorder, is recognized as an endocrine disease due to the genetic loss of hepcidin, the iron hormone produced by the liver. This syndrome is due to unchecked transfer of iron into the bloodstream in the absence of increased erythropoietic needs and its toxic effects in parenchymatous organs. It is caused by mutations that affect any of the proteins that help hepcidin to monitor serum iron, including HFE and, in rarer instances, transferrin-receptor 2 and hemojuvelin, or make its receptor ferroportin, resistant to the hormone. In Caucasians, C282Y HFE homozygotes are numerous, but they are only predisposed to hemochromatosis; complete organ disease develops in a minority, due to alcohol abuse or concurrent genetic modifiers that are now being identified. HFE gene testing can be used to diagnose hemochromatosis in symptomatic patients, but analyses of liver histology and full gene sequencing are required to identify patients with rare, non-HFE forms of the disease. Due to the central pathogenic role of hepcidin, it is anticipated that nongenetic causes of hepcidin loss (eg, end-stage liver disease) can cause acquired forms of hemochromatosis. The mainstay of hemochromatosis management is still removal of iron by phlebotomy, first introduced in 1950s, but identification of hepcidin has not only shed new light on the pathogenesis of the disease and the approach to diagnosis, but etiologic therapeutic applications from these advances are now foreseen.	26164493
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Early age-of-onset iron overload and homozygosity for the novel hemojuvelin mutation HJV R54X (exon 3; c.160A-->T) in an African American male of West Indies descent.	Clinical genetics	2008	3.89	An African American male of West Indies descent was diagnosed to have elevated transferrin saturation, hyperferritinemia, severe iron deposition in hepatocytes, and hepatic cirrhosis at age 4. He was treated with serial phlebotomy to maintain a normal serum ferritin concentration thereafter. We evaluated him at age 23 and confirmed that he had normal serum ferritin levels, severe iron deposition in hepatocytes, hepatic cirrhosis, and portal hypertension. He did not have endocrinopathy, cardiomyopathy, or arthropathy. He was homozygous for the novel hemojuvelin (HJV) premature stop-codon mutation R54X (exon 3; c.160A-->T). He did not have either HFE C282Y, H63D, or S65C, or deleterious coding region mutations of SLC40A1, TFR2, or HAMP. His erythrocyte measures and hemoglobin electrophoresis were consistent with alpha-thalassemia trait. We conclude that homozygosity for HJV R54X accounts for his severe, early age-of-onset hemochromatosis; his phenotype was probably modified by serial phlebotomy therapy.	18492090
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes are at low risk of hemochromatosis-related morbidity.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2009	0.5	The risk of hemochromatosis-related morbidity is unknown among HFE compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D). We used a prospective population-based cohort study to estimate the prevalence of elevated iron indices and hemochromatosis-related morbidity for compound heterozygotes. In all, 31,192 subjects of northern European descent were genotyped for HFE C282Y and H63D. An HFE-genotype stratified random sample of 1,438 subjects, followed for an average of 12 years to a mean age of 65 years, completed questionnaires and gave blood. Clinical examinations were blinded to HFE genotype. A total of 180 (84 males) clinically examined C282Y/H63D participants were compared with 330 (149 males) controls with neither HFE mutation; 132 (65 males) and 270 (122 males), respectively, had serum iron measures at both timepoints. Mean serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) were significantly greater for male and female compound heterozygotes than for wild-types at baseline and follow-up (all P < 0.02) except for females who were premenopausal at baseline, where SF was similar in both genotype groups. For subjects with serum measures from both baseline and follow-up, mean SF and TS levels did not change significantly for men or for postmenopausal women, but for premenopausal women SF levels increased from 43 to 109 microg/L for compound heterozygotes and from 35 to 64 microg/L for wild-types (both P < 0.001). Male and female compound heterozygotes had a similar prevalence of hemochromatosis-related morbidity to wild-types. One of 82 males and zero of 95 females had documented iron overload-related disease. For male compound heterozygotes, mean iron indices do not change during middle age but for female compound heterozygotes menopause results in increased mean SF. Although compound heterozygotes might maintain elevated iron indices during middle age, documented iron overload-related disease is rare.	19554541
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Evidence for an association between compound heterozygosity for germ line mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene and increased risk of colorectal cancer.	Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology	2005	3.62	Whereas a recent study reported an increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with any HFE germ line mutation (C282Y or H63D), other investigators have concluded there is no increased risk, or that any increase is dependent on polymorphisms in HFE-interacting genes such as the transferrin receptor (TFR). We have established the frequency of HFE mutations in colorectal cancer patients (n = 327) with a family history of the disease and randomly selected controls (n = 322); this design increases greatly the study's power. Genotyping for the TRF S142G polymorphism was also conducted on a large proportion of the study group. Using PCR, restriction enzyme mapping, sequencing followed by data analysis with Fisher's exact test and logistic regression, we show that the presence of any HFE mutation (Y282 or D63) was not associated with colorectal cancer risk (P = 0.57). In contrast, individuals compound heterozygous for both mutations (15 cases versus 5 controls) had thrice the odds of developing colorectal cancer (odds ratio, 3.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-8.61) compared with those with a single mutation. This finding did not quite reach statistical significance after allowing for multiple post hoc testing (P(observed) = 0.038 versus P = 0.025, with Bonferonni correction). Overall, our data indicate that individuals with a single HFE mutation, C282Y or H63D, are unlikely predisposed to develop colorectal cancer. However, risk of colorectal cancer might be increased by compound heterozygosity for the HFE mutations in the small number of subjects studied. TFR gene polymorphism was not an independent risk factor and did not modify the disease risk associated with HFE mutation.	15941956
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[A young diabetic with small-nodule liver cirrhosis, high transferrin saturation and negative HFE test].	Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)	2005	0.5	A 28 year young female presented to our hospital for further evaluation with recently diagnosed diabetes mellitus, hyperpigmentation of the skin, hepato- and splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia and an elevated transferrin saturation (96 %), but a negative test for HFE gene mutations such as C282Y and H63D. Using the mini-laparascopic technique we diagnosed a smallnodular liver cirrhosis with an iron overload. This is the clinical presentation of one subtype of the so called Non-HFE-hemochromatosis, the juvenile hemochromatosis (HFE2). Other causes of primary and secondary iron overload have been ruled out. Different from the HFE-positive hemochromatosis (HFE 1) in which the gene defect is located on chromosome 6, the defect in HFE 2 is located on chromosome 1. The underlying genetic defect has been localized within recently identified HJV gene. Phlebotomy is the treatment of choice, to be performed until the ferritin level is lower than 50 microg/l. If liver cirrhosis is present in hemochromatosis, the overall risk of developing heptatocellular carcinoma is 20 times higher than in the normal population. Therefore it is suggested to perform an ultrasound examination of the liver and an AFP-test every 6 months, whereas an MRI-scan should be performed once a year, as a basis for further treatment options.	15942838
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene mutations, body iron stores, dietary iron, and risk of colorectal adenoma in women.	Journal of the National Cancer Institute	2005	0.5	Some experimental evidence suggests that iron may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis, but human data for this role have been conflicting, possibly because of problems related to study design or measurement of iron exposure. We assessed dietary iron intake and genetic and biochemical markers of iron status in a prospective, nested case-control study of women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study. Among 32 826 women who provided a blood specimen, we identified 527 women with colorectal adenoma and 527 matched control subjects who underwent endoscopy but were not diagnosed with adenoma after blood collection. We assessed iron intake, mutations in the HFE gene that are associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (i.e., H63D and C282Y), and plasma biochemical measures of total body iron, including transferrin saturation and the ratio of the concentrations of transferrin receptors to ferritin. Logistic regression models were used to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). All statistical tests were two-sided. Women with any HFE gene mutation had higher total body iron stores, as reflected by higher transferrin saturations (P < .001) and lower levels of the ratio of transferrin receptors to ferritin (P = .02), than women with no HFE gene mutation. However, HFE gene mutations were not associated with risk of adenoma (multivariable RR = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.39; P = .58). Moreover, comparison of extreme categories showed no associations between adenoma and the extent of transferrin saturation (multivariable RR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.63 to 1.47; Ptrend = .66), the ratio of transferrin receptors to ferritin (multivariable RR = 0.98, 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.60; Ptrend = .99), or dietary iron intake (multivariable RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.57; Ptrend = .94). Although our study used several distinct measures of iron status (i.e., genetic mutations, biochemical markers, and dietary intake) and a nested case-control design, we did not observe a role for iron in the pathogenesis of colorectal neoplasia in women.	15956653
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The Q283P amino-acid change in HFE leads to structural and functional consequences similar to those described for the mutated 282Y HFE protein.	Human genetics	2005	5.14	In Caucasians, 4-35% of hemochromatosis patients carry at least one chromosome without a common HFE mutation (i.e. C282Y, H63D and S65C). Several studies have now shown that iron overload phenotypes in such patients can be associated with uncommon HFE mutations. We previously supported implication of the C282Y/Q283P compound heterozygous genotype in hemochromatosis phenotypes and, based on molecular dynamics simulations, proposed that the Q283P substitution prevents normal folding of the HFE alpha3-domain. In the current work, we have used HeLa cells carrying wild-type or Q283P-mutant HFE cDNA under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive promoter to functionally characterise the Q283P mutation. Experiments using cells over-expressing wild-type HFE confirm the existence of beta2microglobulin(beta2m)/HFE and HFE/transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) interactions, as well as the capacity of HFE to reduce transferrin-mediated iron uptake. In contrast, neither beta2m/HFE nor HFE/TfR1 complex formation was detected in cells over-expressing the mutated form of HFE. Moreover, the 283P HFE protein was found to have a very limited effect on the major cellular iron uptake pathway. Combined, our results indicate that the Q283P mutation leads to structural and functional consequences similar to those described for the main hereditary hemochromatosis mutation. As a consequence, our study has implications for the screening of hemochromatosis patients that have one or two copies of HFE which lack the main mutations. It also highlights that protein structure prediction methods could be more generally used to better interpret relationships between rare genotypes and molecular diagnosis of a human inherited disorder.	15965644
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Status of HFE mutation in thalassemia syndromes in north India.	Annals of hematology	2007	3.02	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive and most commonly inherited single gene disorder among Caucasians, with a prevalence of 5 per 1,000 and a carrier frequency of 1 in 10. Two point mutations were described and are referred as C282Y and H63D. In the present study, we have analyzed 729 north Indian samples for C282Y and H63D mutations. Of these, no allele of the C282Y mutation was seen, while 3 homozygous and 43 heterozygous for the H63D mutation were seen in the patients of thalassemia group. However, 47 cases were found heterozygous for the H63D mutation among the normal groups (11.16%).	17401564

Digestive diseases and sciences	2007	2.52	We aimed to determine the relationships between iron overload and HFE gene mutation in chronic liver disease in Turkey. One hundred thirteen chronic liver disease patients and 138 healthy controls were evaluated regarding their clinical, biochemical, and genetic parameters. Each group was divided into two subgroups according to transferrin saturation (TS) (45% and >45%). HFE gene mutation was analyzed by the PCR-RFLP method. C282Y homozygote, heterozygote, and wild-type mutation rates were 1.7%, 0%, and 98.3% in patients and 0%, 1.4%, and 98.6% in controls, respectively. H63D homozygote, heterozygote, and wild-type mutation rates were 1.8%, 24.7%, and 73.5% in patients and 1.4%, 24%, and 74.6% in controls, respectively. Mutation rates were not statistically different in patients with high and normal TS. Iron overload was positively correlated with biochemical activity and Child-Pugh score (P < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, H63D homozygotic mutation was an independent factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.004). We conclude that C282Y mutation is very rare in Turkey. Iron overload is not related to H63D mutation but is positively correlated with biochemical activity and Child-Pugh score in chronic liver diseases.	17410459
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in Asians and Pacific Islanders.	Archives of internal medicine	2007	0.5	Asians and Pacific Islanders in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study had the highest prevalence of elevated serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) levels, but to our knowledge, the reasons for this have not been investigated. Using multiple linear regression, we compared TS and SF distributions for 42 720 Asian, Pacific Islander, and white HEIRS Study participants recruited through 5 field centers in North America who did not have HFE C282Y or H63D alleles. Compared with their white counterparts, Asian men had a 69-ng/mL (155-pmol/L) higher adjusted mean SF level and a 3% higher TS level (P<.001); Asian women had 23-ng/mL (52-pmol/L) higher adjusted mean SF level and a 3% higher TS level (P<.001). The mean TS level of Asian women was higher than that of Pacific Islander women, and the mean SF level of Pacific Islander men was significantly higher than that of white men. These differences remained significant after adjusting for self-reported history of diabetes or liver disease. Additional information for selected participants suggested that these differences are largely unrelated to mean corpuscular volume less than 80 fL, body mass index, or self-reported alcohol intake. Available liver biopsy and phlebotomy data indicated that iron overload is probably uncommon in Asian participants. Higher TS and SF levels in persons of Asian or Pacific Island heritage may need to be interpreted differently than for whites, although the biological basis and clinical significance of higher levels among Asians and Pacific Islanders are unclear.	17420432
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Morbidity risk in HFE associated hereditary hemochromatosis C282Y heterozygotes.	Toxicology	2002	3.82	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is a late-onset, autosomal recessive disorder leading to a chronic iron overload syndrome, finally causing diabetes, cardiomyopathy and liver disease. HHC is the most common single gene disorder in northern Europeans that occurs with a frequency of approximately 0.5%, and most of these patients carry the C282Y and H63D mutation in the HFE gene on chromosome 6p21.3. The vast majority of HHC patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation, but HHC phenotypes are observed in other genotypes. Expression of the disease, in those homozygous for the C282Y mutation, is highly variable depending on the various features of the population studied. C282Y heterozygotes have slightly increased iron stores and in absence of other genetic and/or environmental factors do usually not develop the HHC phenotype. It is currently a matter of debate whether C282Y heterozygotes may have an increased risk for morbidity. Different studies investigating the association of C282Y heterozygocity with morbidity have given conflicting results, as is exemplified by extrahepatic cancers, cardiovascular diseases, alcoholic liver disease, and diabetes. However, there are examples of clear and unambiguous disease associations, such as with sporadic pophyria cutanea tarda. It remains to be seen whether a strong correlation between the C282Y heterozygous state and distinct pathological conditions will exist and large-scale genotyping studies will help to identify such potential risk groups in the future.	12324192
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Mutations in the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D, S65C) in alcoholic patients with finding of iron overload].	Revista clinica espanola	2002	0.76	The pathogenesis of iron overload in alcoholic individuals is not fully elucidated. The frequency of mutations in hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE) is high in this population. Heterozygotes show data of iron overload similar to those in alcoholic individuals. To analyze whether iron excess among alcoholic individuals is associated with mutations in C282Y, H63D or S65C in the HFE gene. Patients and methods. Thirty-two active alcoholic individuals (29 males and 3 females, age range 30-67 years) with data of iron overload (increased serum ferritin with or without saturation of increased transferrin) were studied. In all individuals, mutations C282Y, H63D and S65C were investigated. From 16 cases, liver histology was available. Data on iron overload were compared between patients with and without mutations. Twenty-two patients (68.8%) did not show any mutation, one (3.1%) was heterozygous for C282Y, three (9.4%) were homozygous for H63D, four (12.5%) were heterozygous for H63D, and two patients (6.3%) were heterozygous for C282Y/H63D. None of the patients was homozygous for C282Y or presented mutation in S65C. Transferrin saturation, serum ferritin and liver iron index were similar among with and without mutations. Three patients (9.3%) were diagnosed of hemochromatosis. One of them was homozygous for H63D, other patient was heterozygous for the combined C282Y/H63D, and in the remaining patient none of the mutations was found. In our setting, iron overload among alcoholic individuals seems to be independent of the presence of mutations C282Y, H63D and S65C in the HFE gene.	12361551
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) and stroke.	Stroke	2002	5.79	Increased serum iron is found to be a risk factor for stroke. Carriers of HFE C282Y and H63D mutations have elevated serum iron levels and may have an increased risk for stroke. We studied the association between HFE gene mutations, carotid atherosclerosis, and stroke. We compared the frequency of the HFE C282Y and H63D gene mutations in 202 prevalent and incident cases of stroke with that of 2730 controls from a population-based study, the Rotterdam Study. The influence of HFE mutations on the relationship between hypertension, smoking, and stroke was studied by use of a logistic regression model. In the analyses of hypertension, we used noncarriers and nonhypertensives as reference; in the analysis of smoking, we used noncarriers and those who never smoked as the reference group. Furthermore, we studied the mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery in relation to hypertension, smoking, and the HFE genotype in subjects without stroke. The percentage of both C282Y and H63D carriers in cases (43.7%, n=87) did not differ significantly (P=0.09) from that of controls (37.6%, n=986). The odds ratio for stroke for HFE carriers who also suffered from hypertension was 3.0 (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.6), and for HFE carriers who were also smokers, the odds ratio for stroke was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.4 to 5.0). The mean+/-SD intima-media thickness of the carotid artery was 0.77+/-0.14 mm for noncarriers without a history of hypertension or smoking compared with 0.81+/-0.17 mm for HFE carriers who smoked (P<0.004) and 0.84+/-0.20 mm for HFE carriers who were hypertensive (P<0.001). Mutations in the HFE gene were not significantly related to stroke or atherosclerosis in the carotid artery. The HFE gene may modify the relationship between smoking and stroke.	12364722
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations in African-American women with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.	Ethnicity & disease	2001	1.01	The aim of this study was to compare the frequencies of HFE mutations in African-American women with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) to that of controls and to determine whether these mutations are associated with NIDDM and iron overload. We studied 167 African-American women with NIDDM. The 71 non-diabetic controls were African-American female controls. HLA-A and -B typing and HFE mutation analysis for C282Y and H63D alleles were performed using standard molecular genetic techniques. The frequencies of C282Y and H63D were not significantly different in NIDDM patients and controls. C282Y was observed in 0.59% of patients and 1.41% of controls. H63D was observed in 2.99% of patients and 3.08% of controls. All of the NIDDM patients who possessed either C282Y or H63D mutations had normal values of serum ferritin, serum iron and transferrin saturation. A woman who inherited C282Y also possessed HLA-A3, -B7 which is considered part of the ancestral haplotype containing the gene predisposing to hemochromatosis in Caucasians. The frequencies of C282Y and H63D vary in African Americans from different geographic regions of the United States; this variance can be explained by Caucasian admixture. Although most iron overload cases in African Americans bear more resemblance to cases of African iron overload than to those of Caucasian hemochromatosis, rare cases resembling Caucasian hemochromatosis have been observed in African Americans.	11763282
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Comparative study of the two more frequent HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D): significant different allelic frequencies between the North and South of Portugal.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2001	4.58	An earlier study of reference values of iron parameters in Portugal showed significant differences between populations from northern and southern villages. This study addresses the question of the geographical distribution in Portugal of the two main mutations (C282Y and H63D) of the hereditary hemochromatosis gene, HFE. For that purpose, a stratified sample of 640 anonymous dried blood spot samples was randomly selected from the major regions of Portugal: North, Center, Lisbon and the Tagus Valley, Alentejo and Algarve. Differences in the geographical distribution of these two mutations were observed thus confirming the presumed differences between the age of the two mutations which is compatible with the postulated Celtic/Nordic origin of the C282Y mutation. The finding of a significantly higher allelic frequency of the C282Y mutation in the North (0.058) than in the South (0.009) could also point to an effect of differential selective forces acting in the different geographical areas of the country. Data on archaeological, ethnographic and linguistic records and on the North/South distribution of Portuguese cattle breeds of European or African origin have also been reported. In addition to their interest for population genetics, the results represent a reminder of the need to take into account regional differences in the design of strategies for population screening of hereditary hemochromatosis.	11781701
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A study of genes that may modulate the expression of hereditary hemochromatosis: transferrin receptor-1, ferroportin, ceruloplasmin, ferritin light and heavy chains, iron regulatory proteins (IRP)-1 and -2, and hepcidin.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	We have examined transferrin receptor-1, ferroportin, ceruloplasmin, ferritin light and heavy chains, iron regulatory proteins (IRP)-1 and -2, and hepcidin for mutations that might modulate the iron burden of individuals harboring the common mutant hemochromatosis HFE genotype C282Y/C282Y or cause hemochromatosis independent of mutations in the HFE gene. In a group of white, Asian, and African-American normal and iron-overloaded individuals, the coding and flanking regions of these genes were completely sequenced. Numerous coding region and promoter polymorphisms were detected. These were further examined for association with differences in iron accumulation as measured by plasma transferrin saturation and ferritin levels, but no such association could be documented.	11783942

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Molecular diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis.	Methods in molecular medicine	2001	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism with a frequency of homozygosity in the Caucasian population of 1 in 200-400. The pathophysiologic hallmark of HH is chronic, increased absorption of dietary iron beyond that required for normal iron homeostasis. The excess absorption leads to progressive iron accumulation in parenchymal cells that can manifest in adulthood as multiple end-organ damage (1). In 1996, the gene responsible for the majority of cases of HH was identified. Designated HFE, the HH gene resides on the short arm of chromosome 6 telomeric of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and encodes a 343 amino acid protein (HFE) that shares sequence and structural homology to class I MHC proteins. Approximately 85% of unrelated HH patients are homozygous for a point mutation involving a G to A change at nucleotide 845 in the HFE cDNA sequence (G845A) that converts cysteine, at amino acid position 282, to tyrosine (Cys282Tyr or C282Y) (2).	21370159
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association study between four polymorphisms in the HFE, TF and TFR genes and Parkinson's disease in southern Italy.	Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology	2011	1.78	Iron overload may lead to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and alterations of iron-related genes might be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. The gene of haemochromatosis (HFE) encodes the HFE protein which interacts with the transferrin receptor (TFR), lowering its affinity for iron-bound transferrin (TF). We examined four known polymorphisms, C282Y and H63D in the HFE gene, G258S in the TF gene and S82G in the TFR gene, in 181 sporadic PD patients and 180 controls from Southern Italy to investigate their possible role in susceptibility to PD. No significant differences were found in genotype and allele frequencies between PD and controls for all the polymorphisms studied, suggesting that these variants do not contribute significantly to the risk of PD.	21384276
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Update on enzyme and molecular defects in porphyria.	Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine	1998	1.9	Each porphyria results from decreased activity of one of the enzymes of haem biosynthesis. The molecular basis of enzyme deficiencies in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP) and congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is outlined. All three conditions show extensive allelic heterogeneity. In the autosomal dominant disorders, AIP and VP, no genotype/phenotype correlations have been demonstrated, and the explanation for their low clinical penetrance remains uncertain. In AIP and VP, mutational analysis is superior to biochemical methods for screening families for latent porphyria. In the autosomal recessive condition, CEP, there is some genotype/phenotype correlation--one common mutation (C73R) being associated with severe disease in homozygotes. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is not a simple monogenic disorder. Patients appear to have an inherited susceptibility to inactivation of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) as part of a response to hepatocyte injury by alcohol, HCV and other agents. Inherited factors that, in combination, may predispose to PCT include mutations in the UROD gene, present in about 20% of patients, and the C282Y mutation in the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene.	9638727

Blood cells, molecules & diseases	1998	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis mutation 845A (C282Y) in the HFE gene was recently described, and the C282Y frequencies were reported for various world populations. The aim of this study was to determine the Y allele frequencies of the C282Y mutation for five French populations. The most elevated value (= 5.6%) was obtained for Bretons, in accordance to the hypothesis indicating a Celtic origin of the hereditary hemochromatosis mutation.	9642097
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Classification and diagnosis of iron overload.	Haematologica	1998	6.67	Iron overload is the result of many disorders and could lead to the development of organ damage and increased mortality. The recent description of new conditions associated with iron overload and the identification of the genetic defect of hereditary hemochromatosis prompted us to review this subject and to redefine the diagnostic criteria of iron overload disorders. The material examined in the present review includes articles published in the Journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. The author has been working in the field of iron overload diseases for several years and has contributed ten of the papers cited in the references. Iron overload can be classified on the basis of different criteria: route of access of iron within the organism, predominant tissue site of iron accumulation and cause of the overload. Excess iron can gain access by the enteral route, the parenteral route, and placental route during fetal life. The different distribution of iron within parenchymal or reticuloendothelial storage areas indicates different pathogenetic mechanisms of iron accumulation and has relevant implications in terms of organ damage and prognosis of the patients. Iron overload may be either primary, resulting from a deregulation of intestinal iron absorption as in hemochromatosis or secondary to other congenital or acquired conditions. Diagnosis of iron overload can be suspected on the basis of clinical data, high transferrin saturation and/or serum ferritin values. However, several hyperferritinemic conditions are not related to iron overload, but may imply severe disorders (inflammations, neoplasia) or a deregulation of ferritin synthesis (hereditary hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome), and iron overload secondary to aceruloplasminemia, and the recently described dysmetabolic-associated liver iron overload syndrome, are characterized by low or normal transferrin saturation levels. Liver biopsy is still very useful in the diagnostic approach to iron overload disorders, by defining the amount and the distribution of iron within the liver. The analysis of HFE gene mutations (C282Y and H63D) is a simple and strong tool in the diagnostic work out of iron overload conditions.	9658731
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Molecular genetics and control of iron metabolism in hemochromatosis.	Haematologica	1998	6.67	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HC) is an inborn error of iron metabolism that leads to progressive iron overload. Considerable advances in the knowledge of molecular events in iron metabolism have been recently obtained. These molecular findings, the cloning of the gene responsible for HC (HFE gene) and the results of preliminary studies on the HFE protein prompted us to review this topic. The material examined in this review article includes papers and abstracts published in the Journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. The authors have been working in the field of HC for several years and have contributed eleven of the quoted papers. HC is now recognized as the genetic disease characterized by the homozygosity for the Cys-->Tyr substitution at position 282 (C282Y) of the HFE protein. The mutation abolishes the association of the HFE protein with beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M), making the complex unable to gain the cell surface. Thus HC is an example of abnormal trafficking of the corresponding proteins. It is clear by the analysis of its structure that HFE protein is not an iron transporter itself, but has a regulatory role in iron metabolism. Its peculiar localization in the crypt cells of the small intestine suggests an important role in iron trafficking at this level. However, other proteins are involved in iron uptake, as the recently cloned Nramp2, the first iron transporter discovered in mammalians. Nramp2 has a recognized role both in the intestinal iron uptake and in the iron transport within the erythroblast. The relationships between HFE and Nramp2 are still unexplored. The recent association of HFE gene with transferrin receptor (TfR) in trophoblast cells opens new possibilities on its role in cellular iron uptake. The existence of other forms of genetic iron overload suggests that the scenario of iron proteins is not yet fully defined. Further studies in this field will contribute to our knowledge of iron metabolism regulation in humans.	9658732
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutation analysis of the HFE gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis in African Americans.	American journal of hematology	1998	5.0	Homozygosity for the mutation Cys282Tyr in the HFE gene has recently been identified as a cause of hereditary hemochromatosis, a disorder resulting in the inappropriate absorption of iron. Approximately 10% of Caucasians are heterozygous for this mutation; however, the gene frequency in African Americans is unknown. A study of a control population of African Americans was performed to determine the frequency of the Cys282Tyr and His63Asp alleles in this ethnic group. The carrier frequency for each mutant allele in our African American population was 3.0%. DNA studies of four African-American hemochromatosis patients did not identify any individuals with the Cys282Tyr allele. These findings suggest that if the Cys282Tyr mutation confers susceptibility to hemochromatosis in Caucasians (as suggested by recent studies) there is an alternative mechanism for hemochromatosis in the American black population.	9662273
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Significance and prevalence of the C282Y gene mutation of primary hemochromatosis in the pathogenesis of pophyria cutanea tarda].	Casopis lekaru ceskych	2000	0.5	Hitherto studies on the ethiopathogenesis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) show that the major pathogenic factor is iron ion, which acts via inhibition of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. New speculations have appeared on the possible relation of this role of iron and the occurrence of mutation of the recently discovered gene of the hereditary hemochromatosis HFE, which may cause the iron overloading of the organism. Our paper describes prevalence of the C282Y gene mutation (HFE) together with the clinical and laboratory record in PCT patients. PCT was diagnosed mostly on the basis of clinical finding of actinic-traumatic vesicular dermatitis and the typical laboratory record of elevated higher-carboxylic porphyrines in urine and stool. Other laboratory methods tested the liver functions, plasma iron level and its binding capacity, ferritine level. All patient underwent routine haematological testing. Presence of antibodies against hepatitis C was also assayed (Elisa test 2nd generation, Sanofi Pasteur). In patients with prominent laboratory alterations showing possibility of the hepatic structural lesion, histology from the liver punctate was done. Frequency data of the C282Y gene mutation (HFE) in PCT patients was estimated on the basis of the genetic testing using PCR reaction of our own system. Group of PCT patients had 69 persons (63 patients with the sporadic form and 6 patients with familiar form of the disease). Hereditary haemochromatosis C282Y gene mutation (HH) was found in 15 patients, three of them were homozygotes and twelve heterozygotes (three heterozygotes had the familiar form of the disease). Nobody in this group was positive in the HIV antibody testing. In all porphyria patients with the presence of mutated gene who underwent liver biopsy, siderosis of different degrees was identified. In three patients neither the phenotypic observation nor the laboratory testing have shown haemochromatosis. Prevalence of C282Y gene mutation HFE in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda was studied. Such mutation was found in 15 persons (12 heterozygotes and 3 homozygotes) from the group of 69 tested patients (21.7%). Such frequency is significantly higher than in the control--nonporphyric--persons (10%). Patients were without clinical symptoms. Laboratory haematological changes, typical for HH, manifested in some of them only (elevated level of ferritine was found in 10 from 15 porphyria patients, elevated sideremia in one of them). Red blood cell counts were in both homo- and heterozygotes normal. Concurrence of the two porphyrinogenic factors--presence of gene mutation HFE and hepatitis C infection--was not proved. Antibodies against hepatitis C virus were not identified in any of the patients. Siderosis was found to be only a symptomatic sign, which was pronounced in different degree in all 9 porphyria patients with C282Y gene mutation who underwent liver biopsy. Frequency of C282Y gene mutation in our patients with porphyria cutanea tarda appears similar to that in other Middle European countries. It differs significantly from the frequency found in South European and North European countries (British).	11191743
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The clinical expression of hemochromatosis in Oslo, Norway. Excessive oral iron intake may lead to secondary hemochromatosis even in HFE C282Y mutation negative subjects.	Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology	2000	2.2	The prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis in Norway is one of the highest reported in the world. However, the clinical presentation in patients with hemochromatosis in Norway seems to be different compared with recent studies elsewhere. The aim of this study was to investigate patients with hemochromatosis in one community hospital in Norway and to study the prevalence of the C282Y mutation. One hundred and twenty patients were consecutively admitted to one medical department in Oslo. Serum transferrin and ferritin concentrations were measured in all patients, and a percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained in 108 of 120 (90%) patients. Stainable iron (Perls stain) in hepatocytes was graded from 0 to 4+ and fibrosis from 1 to 4. Genotyping for the C282Y and H63D mutation in the HFE gene was performed by PCR-RFLP. Forty-eight (40%) of the patients suffered from tiredness and astenia and 29 (24%) had typical arthropathy. Only 5 of 105 (4.5%) had biopsy confirmed cirrhosis and 5 had diabetes mellitus. Patients referred from a blood bank had significantly less symptoms and signs compared with other patients. Twenty-one of 120 (17.5%) patients were C282Y mutation negative. Seventeen (81%) of these patients (16 women and 1 man) had a history of extensive oral iron intake lasting from 5 to 50 years. When excluding those with extensive oral iron intake (n = 17), 92 of 103 (89%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, 7 (7%) were heterozygous including 3 compound heterozygous and 4 (4%) were mutation negative. Only a minority of our patients with hemochromatosis had a far advanced disease at the time of diagnosis (less than 5% had cirrhosis) and hemochromatosis in a majority of the C282Y mutation negative patients was associated with excessive oral iron intake for several years.	11199371
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis: automated detection of the two point mutations in the HFE gene: Cys282Tyr and His63Asp.	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	2000	3.02	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is one of the most common inherited diseases among Caucasians. Two mutations in the HFE gene have been implicated in HH: 80 to 90% of the patients with HH are homozygous for the point mutation CYS282Tyr, while the majority of the remaining patients displays either a compound heterozygosity for the mutation CYS282Tyr and the point mutation HIS63Asp, or are homozygous for HIS63Asp. Though the disease can be treated easily, symptoms are non-specific, and onset and severity are influenced by environmental factors, and therefore the disease can remain undetected until decades of iron overload lead to irreversible damage in a variety of organs, which may result in their failure. In order to detect patients with HH, simple and cost-effective tests are needed. We have developed a rapid, automated, PCR-based test which makes use of a diagnostic restriction site in each of two amplified fragments. The test employs off-the-shelf chemistry and uses the automated detection process of an immunoassay analyzer that is available in many clinical laboratories, thus avoiding an additional investment in a more specialized PCR analyzer. Because of its low costs and easy handling, the assay is particularly suited for the routine clinical laboratories.	11205685
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Detection of an unusual combination of mutations in the HFE gene for hemochromatosis.	Genetic testing	2000	0.5	In the present paper, we describe an individual, found as part of a screening study, being homozygous for the C282Y mutation and at the same time heterozygous for the H63D mutation in the HFE gene. Identical results were obtained by three different methods, i.e., by PCR-RFLP, by sequencing, and by melting curve analysis. Thus, the common conception that the C282Y and the H63D mutations are mutually exclusive is not valid. Clinical symptoms and laboratory data on the individual were similar to hemochromatosis patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation. The implications of our finding for diagnostic analytical laboratory procedures are briefly discussed.	11216661
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genotyping of two mutations in the HFE gene using single-base extension and high-performance liquid chromatography.	Analytical chemistry	2001	5.89	Currently, a major focus of human genetics is the utilization of single-nucleotide polymorphisms for clinical diagnostics, whole-genome linkage disequilibrium screens to identify common disease genes such as Alzheimer disease, determination of the recent evolutionary history of a species, and the process of speciation. We have examined single-nucleotide extension coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography as a method to simultaneously genotype two SNPs occurring in the coding region of the HFE gene that produce clinical effects. This assay allows concurrent genotyping of the C282Y and H63D mutations in 11 min and is 100% concordant with current testing methods for both of these mutations.	11217771

Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research	2003	1.4	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is characterized by excess iron deposition. Two mutations in the HFE gene are associated with HH. Heterozygous carriers of HFE mutations are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aims of our project were to identify the frequency of C282Y and H63D mutations in a population from the Małopolska region of south-eastern Poland, and to search for an association of HFE mutations with T2DM. We included 391 individuals in this study: 222 T2DM patients and 169 controls. Genotypes were determined by electrophoresis of the DNA digestion products from SnaBI and DpnII, respectively. Differences in distributions between the groups were then analyzed by the chi-squared test. The frequency of wild/C282Y alleles was 98.2%/1.8% in T2DM patients and 96.7%/3.2% in controls (p=0.19). The frequency of wild/H63D alleles was 85.6%/14.4% and 88.8%/11.2% (p= 0.19), respectively. The distribution of genotypes was not statistically different. However, in stratified analyses based on age of T2DM onset and gender, we observed a higher prevalence of wild/H63D and H63D/H63D genotypes among T2DM patients diagnosed at > 49 years of age, the mean age for the entire group (p=0.018), and among male T2DM individuals (p=0.005) than in controls. The frequency of HH-associated mutations in this population from south-eastern Poland is similar to other Caucasians. We found no evidence for the association of the C282Y mutation with T2DM. The results do suggest, however, that the H63D mutation may play a role in the pathogenesis of late onset T2DM and in males in this Polish population.	12601293
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haematological effects of the C282Y HFE mutation in homozygous and heterozygous states among subjects of northern and southern European ancestry.	British journal of haematology	2003	5.4	High frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene occur in European populations, even though homozygous and compound heterozygous states are associated with hereditary haemochromatosis, which is a disease that decreases fitness. This suggests that heterozygotes may possess a selective advantage. HFE mutations increase iron absorption in patients with haemochromatosis, and the mean transferrin saturations and ferritin levels are mildly increased in heterozygotes, suggesting that HFE mutations may protect against iron depletion and iron deficiency anaemia. In this study of 23,681 Caucasian adults, mean transferrin saturation, serum ferritin and haemoglobin levels were significantly higher in subjects carrying HFE mutations compared with wild types. Analysed by ethnicity, mean haemoglobin and mean erythrocyte volume (MCV) were significantly lower in those with a southern versus northern European ancestry. C282Y mutation carriers had an increased mean haemoglobin level in both ethnic groups. Prevalence of non-anaemic iron deficiency was significantly lower among female carriers of the C282Y mutation compared with HFE wild types. However, prevalence of frank iron deficiency anaemia did not differ significantly among genotypes. Quantile:quantile plots showed a small but significant upward shift in the mid-range of the haemoglobin distribution among C282Y mutation carriers that was consistent with an increased mean haemoglobin level without significant changes in the anaemic range.	12614226
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations and response to chloroquine in porphyria cutanea tarda.	Archives of dermatology	2003	0.5	To examine the role of hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations, which are associated with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), in the therapeutic response to chloroquine. We retrospectively analyzed a database (Excel version 2001 [Microsoft Excel, Redmond, Wash]; date range of search, 1985-1999) of chloroquine-treated patients with PCT on whether HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) might have influenced the clinical response, urinary porphyrin excretion, liver enzyme activities, and serum iron markers. Serum samples and corresponding complete sets of data before and after therapy were available in 62 of 207 patients with PCT who were treated exclusively with chloroquine. Academic teaching hospital. For treatment, low-dose chloroquine diphosphate, 125 to 250 mg twice weekly, was used during a median time of 16 months (range, 12-26 months). Of the 62 German patients with PCT, 37 (60%) carries HFE mutations. Chloroquine therapy was accompanied by clinical remission and reduced urinary porphyrin excretion (P<.001) in the 24 patients (39%) with HFE wild type as well as in 35 HFE heterozygous patients with PCT (56%). Decreases of serum iron markers following chloroquine therapy were limited to patients with PCT and HFE wild type. All patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation (3 [5%] of 62) had high serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation and failed to respond to chloroquine treatment. The therapeutic response to chloroquine was not compromised by C282Y heterozygosity and compound heterozygosity of HFE mutations. Because HFE C282Y homozygotes (+/+) did not respond to chloroquine and a decrease in serum iron concentration was limited to patients with PCT and HFE wild type, phlebotomy should be first-line therapy in patients with PCT and HFE mutations.	12622622
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of genes implicated in iron regulation in individuals presenting with primary iron overload.	Human genetics	2004	5.14	Extensive investigation into the molecular basis of iron overload disorders has provided new insights into the complexity of iron metabolism and related cellular pathways. The possible involvement of genes affecting iron homeostasis, including HFE, SLC40A1, HAMP and CYBRD1, was investigated in individuals who were referred for confirmation or exclusion of a diagnosis of haemochromatosis, but who tested negative or were heterozygous for the causative HFE mutation, C282Y. Denaturing high performance liquid chromatography analysis of these genes revealed a unique spectrum of mutations in the South African study population, including 67 unrelated patients and 70 population-matched controls. Two novel CYBRD1 gene mutations, R226H and IVS1-4C-->G, were identified in 11% of South African Caucasian patient referrals. We identified a novel D270V mutation in the SLC40A1 gene in a Black South African female with iron overload. These mutations were absent in the control population. In Africans with iron overload not related to the HFE gene, the possible involvement of the SLC40A1 and CYBRD1 genes was demonstrated for the first time. This study confirms the genetic heterogeneity of haemochromatosis and highlights the significance of CYBRD1 mutations in relation to iron overload.	15338274
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The HFE gene is associated to an earlier age of onset and to the presence of diabetic nephropathy in diabetes mellitus type 2.	Endocrine	2004	3.28	We initiated the present work to determine whether the presence of the HFE C282Y or H63D mutations could be related to the clinical expression of diabetes mellitus type 2. Two hundred and twenty five type 2 consecutive diabetic patients were included and the HFE genotypes were determined. Younger ages of onset of diabetes as well as a longer duration of the disease were detected in patients carrying at least one C282Y allele (p = 0.007). An increased prevalence of retinopathy (p = 0.014) and of nephropathy (p = 0.04) were also detected in individuals carrying at least one C282Y allele in comparison with patients carrying the other alleles. The increased prevalence of retinopathy in C282Y carriers is related to the increased duration of the disease, but we not have detected that the prevalence of nephropathy is associated with the duration of the disease. However, multivariate logistic regression confirms that the prevalence of nephropathy is higher in the group of patients carrying at least one C282Y allele or the H63D/H63D genotype as compared to the group of patients with the wild-type (N/N) or the N/H63D genotype. To our knowledge our study is the first one to report an earlier age of onset in type 2 diabetic patients carrying HFE mutations.	15347835
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Curaçao patients with coronary artery disease have a higher prevalence of the HFE C282Y mutation.	The West Indian medical journal	2004	0.5	Epidemiological studies indicate a positive relation between iron status and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk The HFE C282Y allele is associated with increased iron status and higher CAD risk. We investigated whether HFE C282Ymight be a CAD risk factor in Curaçao in a case-control study design. The patient group comprised 42 men and 10 women. Fifty-four men and 30 women without history of CAD served as age and gender matched controls. HFE C282Y genotypes were established using sequence-specific priming polymerase chain reaction. None of the investigated subjects were homozygous for HFE C282Y, whereas 5/52 (9.6%) CAD patients and 1/84 controls (1.2%) were heterozygous for HFE C282Y (p = 0.03). The HFE C282Y mutation was 8.8 fold (95% CI 1.001, 77.8; p = 0.049) more prevalent in CAD patients than in controls. The HFE C282Y allele frequency in Curaçao is higher than that of African populations, but comparable with that of Jamaica. We conclude that Curaçao CAD patients have somewhat higher frequency of HFE C282Y heterozygosity than controls, and that the HFE C282Y allele frequency in the Curaçao population is higher than might be expected in persons of African descent. The consequences of HFE C282Y heterozygosity as CAD risk factor are as yet uncertain, since there is no proof that iron lowering reduces CAD risk.	15352740
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Screening for mutations by expressing patient cDNA segments in E. coli: homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency.	Human mutation	1992	5.09	Deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) causes the most common form of inherited homocystinuria. We developed a simple CBS expression system in E. coli to screen for pathogenic mutations in affected individuals. Portions of patient cDNAs were amplified by PCR and used to replace the corresponding segments of normal human CBS cDNA in the bacterial expression plasmid pHCS3. Hybrid CBS was expressed in E. coli and the segments of patient's cDNA which extinguished CBS activity were sequenced to identify the mutation. The first study of a pyridoxine-responsive patient using this screen revealed that of the clones which contained either the middle or the 3'-portion of his cDNA, about half were devoid of catalytic activity. Subsequent sequencing of the affected segments confirmed a compound heterozygosity for a maternal T833-->C transition (I278T) and for a paternal A-->C transversion in the intron 11 splice acceptor. The latter mutation leads to an in-frame deletion of exon 12 (nt 1224-1358, amino acids W408 to G453). This bacterial expression system proved to be a rapid screening method for localizing pathogenic mutations in CBS, allowing us to sequence the affected portions of mutant cDNA within 7-10 days of harvesting cultured fibroblasts.	1301198
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepatic iron loading in patients with compound heterozygous HFE mutations.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2004	4.47	To assess the severity of hepatic iron loading in patients with a compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D HFE genotype. A total of 246 patients were referred to the Hepatology Clinic at a tertiary hospital for HFE genotyping and further assessment of elevated serum transferrin saturation and/or ferritin results, either with or without abnormal liver function tests. Subjects of the study were 19 patients compound heterozygous for HFE who had liver biopsy, quantitative liver iron estimation and liver histopathology. Mild iron overload [hepatic iron concentration between 30 and 100 micromol/g dry weight], was present in 16/19 compound heterozygous patients, three patients had values within the reference range. As well as the compound heterozygous HFE genotype, 18/19 patients were found to have had at least one additional risk factor for developing either iron loading or liver disease. Compound heterozygous patients show no more than mild liver iron loading. The decision whether or not to recommend liver biopsy in C282Y/H63D patients with abnormal serum iron indices and/or liver function tests should be based on the need to evaluate liver damage rather than solely to assess liver iron loading.	15566515
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Spectrum and haplotypes of the HFE hemochromatosis gene in Iran: H63D in beta-thalassemia major and the first E277K homozygous.	The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association	2004	0.5	We present the molecular analysis of HFE gene in 400 Southwest Iranian individuals. We have studied 43 newborn, selected for the presence of HbBart's at birth, 203 normal adult and 154 transfused patients affected with beta-thalassemia. Mutation analysis consisted of amplification and direct sequencing using two different pairs of forward and reverse primers. The C282Y and S65C mutations were not found. The H63D mutation was present with an allele frequency of 0.10 in newborns, 0.082 in normal adults and 0.080 in the beta-thalassemia major populations, respectively. No differences were found between normal adults and thalassemia major patients suggesting that this mutation does not increase mortality in beta-thalassemia. The H63D mutation was found associated with haplotype VI in 41% of the chromosomes. Other haplotypes were found suggesting a multicentric origin rather than a single mutation of European origin. While sequencing exon 4, a G --> A transition was found in the proximity of the C282Y mutation. The effect of this single base substitution (E277K) previously reported in an Asian individual and now found in homozygous form in a young transfused and chelated homozygous beta-thalassemia patient is not yet known.	15570296
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of C282Y and H63D mutations in the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene in Tunisian population.	Annales de genetique		0.5	The studies of the HFE mutations: H63D and C282Y in North African populations have revealed the extreme rarity or even the absence of the C282Y mutation. We have examined 1140 chromosomes (570 Tunisian people) for the presence of the two HFE mutations by PCR-RFLP analysis. We have found that the allele frequencies are, respectively, 15.17% (+/-2.1%) for the H63D and 0.09% (+/-0.17%) for the C282Y. These results are consistent with the worldwide spread of the H63D mutation and the north European restriction of the C282Y. This study will be completed by determining whether homozygote trait for H63D and associated risk factors (beta thalassémia) can lead to iron overload in Tunisia.	15581829
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequencies of HFE gene mutations associated with haemochromatosis in the population of Libya living in Benghazi.	International journal of clinical and experimental medicine	2011	1.07	THE STUDIES OF THE HFE MUTATIONS: H63D and C282Y in North African populations have revealed the extreme rarity or even the absence of the C282Y mutation. We have examined 200 chromosomes (100 Libyan people live in Benghazi) for the presence of the two HFE mutations by PCR-RFLP analysis by using PCR conditions used to amplify both Autosomal and Y chromosomal STRs. We have found that the allele frequencies are, respectively, 17% for the H63D and 0% for the C282Y. These results are consistent with the worldwide spread of the H63D mutation and the north European restriction of the C282Y.	21977233
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Four variants in transferrin and HFE genes as potential markers of iron deficiency anaemia risk: an association study in menstruating women.	Nutrition & metabolism	2011	3.28	Iron deficiency anaemia is a worldwide health problem in which environmental, physiologic and genetic factors play important roles. The associations between iron status biomarkers and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to be related to iron metabolism were studied in menstruating women. A group of 270 Caucasian menstruating women, a population group at risk of iron deficiency anaemia, participated in the study. Haematological and biochemical parameters were analysed and 10 selected SNPs were genotyped by minisequencing assay. The associations between genetic and biochemical data were analysed by Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) test and decision trees. Dietary intake of a representative subgroup of these volunteers (n = 141) was assessed, and the relationship between nutrients and iron biomarkers was also determined by linear regression. Four variants, two in the transferrin gene (rs3811647, rs1799852) and two in the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D), explain 35% of the genetic variation or heritability of serum transferrin in menstruating women. The minor allele of rs3811647 was associated with higher serum transferrin levels and lower transferrin saturation, while the minor alleles of rs1799852 and the C282Y and H63D mutations of HFE were associated with lower serum transferrin levels. No association between nutrient intake and iron biomarkers was found. In contrast to dietary intake, these four SNPs are strongly associated with serum transferrin. Carriers of the minor allele of rs3811647 present a reduction in iron transport to tissues, which might indicate higher iron deficiency anaemia risk, although the simultaneous presence of the minor allele of rs1799852 and HFE mutations appear to have compensatory effects. Therefore, it is suggested that these genetic variants might potentially be used as markers of iron deficiency anaemia risk.	21978626
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genetic variability, body iron stores, and the risk of type 2 diabetes in U.S. women.	Diabetes	2005	8.78	To determine whether the HFE gene variants H63D and C282Y are associated with body iron stores and the risk of type 2 diabetes, we conducted a nested case-control study of 714 incident cases of type 2 diabetes and 1,120 matching control subjects in a prospective cohort, the Nurses' Health Study. In both healthy control and diabetic case subjects, H63D homozygosity, C282Y, and the compound heterozygotes were associated with significantly higher levels of plasma ferritin and significantly lower ratios of transferrin receptors to ferritin. Such effects were independent of age, BMI, and lifestyle factors. Overall, there were no significant differences in genotypes of H63D and C282Y between the case and control subjects. A meta-analysis of 4,245 case and 5,982 control subjects indicated a null association of C282Y with diabetes risk, whereas carriers of H63D or the compound heterozygotes had marginally increased risk (odds ratio [OR] 1.11 [95% CI 1.00-1.25] and 1.60 [0.99-2.60], respectively). In addition, we found a significant interaction between HFE variants and heme iron intake (P for interaction = 0.029). The ORs of type 2 diabetes across increasing quartiles of heme iron were 1.00, 1.21 (0.72-2.01), 1.72 (1.03-2.88), and 1.49 (0.91-2.46) among the participants with either the H63D or C282Y variant, whereas the ORs were 1.00, 0.71 (0.49-1.05), 1.12 (0.76-1.66), and 0.96 (0.65-1.42) among those with wild-type genotypes. Our data indicate significant effects of H63D and C282Y on body iron stores and suggest a potential interaction between HFE genotypes and heme iron intake in relation to the risk of type 2 diabetes.	16306377
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE-codon 63/282 (H63D/C282Y) gene variants in Mexican Mestizos are not risk factors for leukemia.	Archives of medical research	2006	2.22	In some Caucasian populations it has been found that the C282Y hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutation is a risk factor for the development of leukemia and other malignancies. In a group of 50 Mexican mestizo patients and 153 normal controls, the HFE gene mutations H63D and C282Y were studied by means of ARMS-PCR. In the group of patients with leukemia we found a heterozygote for the C282Y mutation, seven heterozygotes for the H63D mutation, a double heterozygote for the H63D / C282Y mutation and 41 normal homozygotes. These data are not different from those observed in normal controls, where the allele frequencies were 0.062 and 0.013 for the H63D and C282Y HFE gene mutations, respectively. These HFE gene mutations are not risk factors for the development of leukemia in Mexican mestizos.	16314188
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical aspects of hemochromatosis.	Seminars in liver disease	2005	5.67	The term hemochromatosis is commonly used as synonymous with HFE-associated genetic iron overload but several rarer causes of an identical clinicopathological syndrome have been described in recent years. The most common symptoms are lethargy and arthralgia, and the major complications of end-stage disease are cirrhosis, diabetes, and cardiac and endocrine manifestations. However, with the development of cascade screening for family members of affected probands as well as screening for common diseases at health checks, hemochromatosis is being detected at increasingly early stages, often when there are only biochemical abnormalities. The available evidence from screening studies strongly suggests that approximately 75% of C282Y homozygous subjects have biochemical expression. Hepatic iron overload is present in approximately 56% and 34% of men and women, respectively, advanced hepatic fibrosis in 18.7% and 5.4%, respectively, and cirrhosis in 5.8% and 1.9%, respectively. In subjects with severe expression of the disease, additional modifying genetic mutations have been described including those in hepcidin and hemojuvelin. Treatment is by regular phlebotomy which, if instituted before the development of cirrhosis, results in normal life expectancy.	16315132
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for HFE and iron overload.	Seminars in liver disease	2005	5.67	Type 1 hereditary hemochromatosis is a common disorder of iron overload occurring in individuals homozygous for the C282Y HFE gene mutation. It can be a progressive and fatal condition. Early detection and phlebotomy prior to the onset of cirrhosis can reduce morbidity and normalize life expectancy. It is readily identified through biochemical testing for iron overload using serum transferrin saturation and genetic testing for C282Y homozygosity. General population screening has been waived in preference to targeting high-risk groups such as first-degree relatives of affected individuals and those with clinical features suggestive of iron loading. This screening strategy is likely to continue until uncertainties regarding the natural history of the disease, age-related penetrance, and management of asymptomatic individuals are clarified. Potential ethical, legal, and psychosocial issues arising through application of genetic screening programs also must be resolved prior to implementation of general population screening programs.	16315134
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Pathophysiology of hereditary hemochromatosis.	Seminars in liver disease	2005	5.67	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) encompasses several inherited disorders of iron homeostasis characterized by increased gastrointestinal iron absorption and tissue iron deposition. The most common form of this disorder is HFE-related HH, nearly always caused by homozygosity for the C282Y mutation. A substantial proportion of C282Y homozygotes do not develop clinically significant iron overload, suggesting roles for environmental factors and modifier genes in determining the phenotype. Recent studies have demonstrated that the pathogenesis of nearly all forms of HH involves inappropriately decreased expression of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin. Hepcidin serves to decrease the export of iron from reticuloendothelial cells and absorptive enterocytes. Thus, HH patients demonstrate increased iron release from these cell types, elevated circulating iron, and iron deposition in vulnerable tissues. The mechanism by which HFE influences hepcidin expression is an area of current investigation and may offer insights into the phenotypic variability observed in persons with mutations in HFE.	16315135
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron in nonhemochromatotic liver disorders.	Seminars in liver disease	2005	5.67	Iron is essential for cellular functions, but in excessive amounts it is toxic to cells. The harmful effects are related to increased oxidative stress and production of reactive oxygen species causing oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Heavy iron overload as occurs in primary and secondary hemochromatosis can cause fibrosis of various parenchymal organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas. Lesser degrees of hepatic iron deposition are also associated with, and seem to be risk factors for, certain nonhemochromatotic liver diseases. Porphyria cutanea tarda is associated with hepatic iron overload and responds to iron-reduction therapy. Other recent evidence indicates that the prevalence of HFE gene mutations is increased in chronic viral hepatitis and that patients with chronic hepatitis C harboring especially the C282Y mutation are more likely to suffer from advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis and to do so at younger ages. In this article we review selected nonhemochromatotic disorders in which iron can play an important comorbid role.	16315139
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hereditary hemochromatosis: phenotypic study in a Spanish population].	Medicina clinica	2005	1.27	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) displays an important phenotypic variability and is a disease influenced by many factors. We included 88 patients with HH. Main clinical and laboratory data were analyzed, and the influence of 6 variables on intensity of iron overload was evaluated. In 38.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 28.5-49.6%) patients, none of the typical symptoms of the disease was observed. 30,9% (95% CI, 21.7-41.7%) showed abnormalities of the glucose metabolism. We detected an increase in sideremia in 75.0% patients (CI 95%, 64.4-83.3%), transferrin saturation index (TSI) in 95.4% (CI 95%, 88.1-98.5%) and ferritin in 93.2% (CI 95%, 85.1-97.1%) of patients. In addition, we observed increased values of GPT and alkaline phosphatase in an appreciable percentage of patients. Ferritin was significantly higher in men (1329.4 [913.2] ng/ml vs 656.6 [644.5] ng/ml; p < 0.001), and in those older than 45 years (1293.9 [1006.9] ng/ml vs 868.9 [642.8] ng/ml; p = 0.023] and in not blood donors (1205.2 [926.8] vs 524.8 [365.9] ng/ml; p < 0.001). TSI was 81.9% (19.6) in C282Y homozygotes and 65.7% (19.2) in the rest of HFE genotypes (p = 0.002). Differences of TSI with regard to sex, age or status of blood donor were not detected. Sideremia was significantly higher in patients infected by virus C (251.8 [24.4] microg/dl vs 182.8 [45.8] microg/dl; p = 0.001). HH patients have a noticeable phenotypic variability, and for that reason clinical symptoms are only orientative for the diagnosis. The relationship between HH and glucose metabolism should be investigated further. Iron parameters can be influenced by age, sex, HFE genotype, blood donation, alcohol intake and hepatitis C virus infection.	16324464
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Factor V Leiden and the common haemochromatosis mutation HFE C282Y: is there an association in familial venous thromboembolic disease?	British journal of haematology	1999	5.4	The involvement in venous thrombosis of the two most common mutations of the hereditary haemochromatosis gene (HFE C282Y and HFE H63D) was investigated in 239 patients with objectively proven venous thrombosis. Neither mutation showed an increased prevalence in the cohort (HFE C282Y: 13.0% (95% CI 9.3-17.8) patients, 16.2% (95% CI 14.3-18.2) controls; HFE H63D: 28.3% (95% CI 22.9-34.3) patients, 28.1% (95% CI 25.8-30.6) controls. Neither mutation was increased in patients with factor V Leiden (FVL) compared to those without. However, HFE C282Y was increased among patients who had both FVL and a family history of thrombosis (7/20), compared with those with FVL and no family history (1/22) (relative risk 7.97, 95% CI 1.5-43.1, P = 0.016).	10520044
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Molecular genetics of hemochromatosis].	Annales d'endocrinologie	1999	0.5	Hemochromatosis is a recessive disorder of iron metabolism characterized by progressive iron loading of parenchymal organs, which accounts for clinical complications such as cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, cardiopathy, endocrine dysfunctions and arthropathy. Clinical complications, which usually develop after the third or fourth decade of life, can be fatal but may be prevented by phlebotomy if iron excess is detected at a very early stage. The hemochromatosis gene (HFE), located 4.5 megabases telomeric to the HLA-A locus, encodes an HLA class I like protein and two missense mutations, C282Y and H63D in complete disequilibrium have been identified within this gene. Due to its high frequency in the general population, the involvement of H63D in the pathogenesis of the disease remains controversial, and it might correspond to a minor mutation. Conversely, the C282Y mutation is tightly linked to the disease, as it accounts for 80 to 100% of the hemochromatosis cases in Northern Europe. The lower frequency observed, in the patients, in Italy and South of France led to imagine either the implication of other mutations or of other genes. The C282Y mutation is absent in Asia and Africa and is present in the general population with a decreasing gradient of frequency from Northern to Southern Europe. The prevalence of the disease was usually estimated to be 3% but the observed frequency of the C282Y homozygotes is 5% in our breton population raising the question of the penetrance of the disease, and consequently the use of the genotypic test for its systematic screening. As HFE encodes a membrane protein similar to HLA class I protein, its contribution to iron overload is not obvious. The normal protein is predicted to to be expressed at the cell surface in association with beta 2-microglobulin, a localization for which C282Y is critical as it disrupts this association. This protein has also been shown to form a stable complex with the transferrin receptor leading to a decreased affinity for transferrin. A better knowledge of its function will help to decipher iron and different metal-ions metabolism. Although the exact role of the HFE protein is unknown, the genotypic test allows the clinicians to ascertain their diagnosis and genetic counselling.	10520411
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Insulin resistance-associated hepatic iron overload.	Gastroenterology	1999	18.19	Hepatic iron overload has been reported in various metabolic conditions, including the insulin-resistance syndrome (IRS) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The aim of this study was to show that such hepatic iron overload is part of a unique and unrecognized entity. A total of 161 non-C282Y-homozygous patients with unexplained hepatic iron overload were included. We determined the age; sex; presence of IRS (1 or more of the following: body mass index of >25, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia); serum iron tests and liver iron concentration (LIC; reference value, <36 micromol/g); liver function test results; C282Y and H63D HFE mutations; and liver histological status. Patients were predominantly male and middle-aged. Most (94%) had IRS. Transferrin saturation was increased in 35% (median, 42%; range, 13%-94%). LIC ranged from 38 to 332 micromol/g (median, 90 micromol/g), and LIC/age ratio ranged from 0.5 to 4.8 (median, 1.8). Allelic frequencies of both HFE mutations were significantly increased compared with values in normal controls (C282Y, 20% vs. 9%; H63D, 30% vs. 17%), only because of a higher prevalence of compound heterozygotes. Patients with no HFE mutations had similar degrees of iron overload as those with other genotypes, except for compound heterozygotes, who had slightly more iron burden. Steatosis was present in 25% of patients and NASH in 27%. Portal fibrosis (grades 0-3) was present in 62% of patients (grade 2 or 3 in 12%) in association with steatosis, inflammation, and increased age. Sex ratio, IRS, transferrin saturation, and LIC did not vary with liver damage. Serum ferritin concentration, liver function test results, and fibrosis grade were more elevated in patients with steatosis and NASH than in others, but LIC and allelic frequencies of HFE mutations were similar. This study shows that patients with unexplained hepatic iron overload are characterized by a mild to moderate iron burden and the nearly constant association of an IRS irrespective of liver damage.	10535879
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: impact of molecular and iron-based testing on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of a common, chronic disease.	Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine	1999	2.63	"""To review the current state-of-the-art regarding the role of iron- and DNA-based testing on the detection, treatment, and prevention of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), the most common single-gene disorder in white people. Review of the medical literature, with particular emphasis on recent reports of the impact of DNA-based testing on the detection of symptomatic and presymptomatic patients with HH. Hereditary hemochromatosis, a common autosomal recessive iron overload disorder (with a population prevalence of 0.3%-0.8%), is a common cause of preventable liver, heart, joint, and endocrine disease. Since the associated clinical signs and symptoms are nonspecific, an accurate HH diagnosis demands both a high index of suspicion and the direct laboratory demonstration of elevated iron parameters. The substantial public health burden of HH as a common, deadly, detectable, and treatable chronic disease has led the College of American Pathologists to recommend that """"systematic screening for hemochromatosis is warranted for all persons over the age of 20 years."""" The recent discovery that most HH cases are the result of a single well-conserved homozygous missense mutation (C282Y) within a novel transferrin-receptor binding protein (HFE) has given rise to diagnostic clinical tests for the DNA-based detection of this pathologic mutation. This direct HFE mutation test can now be used not only to confirm the diagnosis of HH in those with symptomatic disease, but also, perhaps more importantly, to detect those with presymptomatic iron overload in whom future disease manifestations may be prevented (with phlebotomy therapy)."""	10539907
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effect of Hereditary Hemochromatosis Gene (HFE) H63D and C282Y Mutations on Iron Overload in Sickle Cell Disease Patients.	Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology	2016	0.5	Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease which is one of the most important reasons of iron overload. Sickle cell disease is a hemoglobinopathy which occurs as a result of a homozygote mutation in the hemoglobin gene. Erythrocyte transfusion is frequently used in treatment of this disease. Iron overload as a result of transfusion is important in mortality and morbidity of sickle cell anemia patients as well as in other hemoglobinopathies. In this study, the effect of HFE gene p.H63D and p.C282Y mutations on transfusion related cardiac and liver iron overload in sickle cell disease patients who carries homozygous hemoglobin S mutation has been investigated. This is a prospective single center cross sectional study in patients with homozygote hemoglobin S mutation between the years 2008 and 2013. The patients were divided into two groups. The first group (Group A, n=31) was taking chelation therapy and the second group (Group B, n=13) was not. Direct and indirect iron loads were analyzed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biochemically, respectively. HFE gene mutations were analyzed by PCR-RFLP method. Statistical analyses were performed by independent samples t-Test. p.H63D mutation was detected in 10 (32.3%) patients in group A and in only one patient (7.7%) in group B. When the two groups were compared for iron overload, iron deposition in liver was significantly higher in Group B (p=0.046). In addition, in group A, iron deposition was significantly higher in HFE mutation carriers compared to patients without the mutation (p=0.05). Results of this study showed that HFE gene mutations are important in iron deposition in the liver in patients with sickle cell disease.	27095682
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of hemochromatosis-related symptoms among individuals with mutations in the HFE gene.	Mayo Clinic proceedings	2002	5.92	To determine the prevalence of hemochromatosis-related symptoms in homozygotes for the HFE mutation C282Y compared with controls without HFE mutations identified through a large screening program of subjects attending a health appraisal center. Presence of symptoms commonly associated with clinical hemochromatosis was ascertained by self-report on a written questionnaire among C282Y homozygotes and HFE wild-type subjects of white or Hispanic ethnicity identified from screening 41,599 adult subjects between March 1999 and August 2001. A subset of C282Y homozygotes and wild-type subjects identified from 12,756 subjects attending the center in the final year of the study completed a standardized double-blind interview with a physician regarding the presence, duration, and severity of a larger set of symptoms. Prevalence of symptoms among C282Y homozygotes and wild-type controls ascertained by written questionnaire and interview were compared by chi2 analysis or Fisher exact test. Symptoms among subjects with other combinations of the C282Y and H63D HFE mutations were also assessed by questionnaire. The 124 C282Y homozygotes who filled out the written questionnaire and the 17 C282Y homozygotes who completed the physician double-blind interview reported no significantly higher rates of arthritis or joint pain, abdominal pain, arrhythmias, darkening of skin, or other symptoms traditionally associated with hemochromatosis compared with the 22,429 wild-type controls who filled out the written questionnaire and 29 wild-type controls who completed the double-blind interview. The only symptom reported more frequently by C282Y homozygotes was loss of body hair, reported by 5 C282Y/C282Y female subjects compared with 1 wild-type male subject (P=.02) in the physician interview. Symptoms among subjects with other HFE genotypes were similar to symptoms of wild-type subjects. Results of this study indicate that many of the symptoms associated with hemochromatosis are common among HFE wild types and that clinical penetrance of the C282Y/C282Y genotype in regard to these symptoms is low.	12059121
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis and porphyria.	Seminars in gastrointestinal disease	2002	0.5	A 52-year-old man presented to his primary care physician with blisters and sores on the backs of his hands. Laboratory studies supported a diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda, complicated by the presence of both the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene, with susequent iron over-load. This case illustrates the need to understand the pathogenesis of porphyria cutanea tarda, particularly the role of excess iron in the overproduction of uroporphyrin. Iron, by catalyzing the formation of reactive oxygen species, can enhance uroporphyrin formation by increasing the rate at which uroporphyrinogen is oxidized to urophophyrin. Iron may also act indirectly to inhibit uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity by enhancing the formation of non-porphyrin products of porphyrinogen oxidation that are themselves direct inhibitors of the enzyme. Finally, iron can act to increase urophorphyrin production by inducing delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase, thus increasing the amount of delta-aminolevulinic acid, the precursor to uroporphyrinogen, present in the cell. After the diagnosis, the patient underwent an aggressive series of therapeutic phlebotomies to reduce iron levels, and gradually the cutaneous manifestations of porphyria cutanea tarda improved.	12064861
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis: genetics and beyond.	Seminars in gastrointestinal disease	2002	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) comprises several inherited disorders of iron homeostasis characterized by increased gastrointestinal iron absorption and secondary tissue iron deposition. The most common form of this disorder is called HFE-related HH and is caused by homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Recently, other less common hereditary forms of iron overload have been recognized and are designated as non-HFE-related HH. The identification and cloning of HFE and other genes involved in iron metabolism has greatly expanded our understanding of many aspects of HH. The introduction of a commercially available genetic test for the C282Y and H63D mutations of HFE allows presymptomatic diagnosis, and adds precision to studies of the population genetics of HFE-related HH. It is now recognized that a substantial proportion of C282Y homozygotes does not develop clinically significant iron overload, and modifier genes may be involved in this phenomenon. Mouse models of HH and cell culture studies have increased our understanding of the normal physiology and pathophysiology of iron homeostasis. Future investigations will refine our knowledge of the mechanisms of action of HFE protein, the phenotypic variability observed in persons homozygous for the C282Y mutation, and the mechanisms responsible for non-HFE-related HH.	12064862
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Polymorphisms in the 5' flanking region of the HFE gene: linkage disequilibrium and relationship to iron homeostasis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	We have discovered two single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5' flanking region of the HFE gene. These mutations are -970 T-->G and -467 C-->G, numbering from the ATG start codon. When a T was present at -970, a C was always found at -467. The C allele was the less common at nt -467 with a gene frequency of 0.31 in white subjects with wild-type HFE. Slightly lower gene frequencies were observed in a small number of Hispanic and African-American subjects and a slightly higher frequency in a few Asian subjects. The less common -467 mutation was found in almost 12 chromosomes that bore the 845G-->A (C282Y) mutation and was significantly more prevalent in chromosomes containing the 187C-->G (H63D) mutation. Although this mutation is near an HNF3B/HFH2 site, its presence did not seem to affect iron metabolism as judged by the serum ferritin or transferrin saturation levels. The tighter association of the -467 polymorphism with the C282Y mutation is consistent with other data that suggest that the C282Y mutation has occurred relatively recently and that the H63D mutation is considerably older.	12064915
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effect of Native American ancestry on iron-related phenotypes of Alabama hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity.	BMC medical genetics	2006	2.09	In age-matched cohorts of screening study participants recruited from primary care clinics, mean serum transferrin saturation values were significantly lower and mean serum ferritin concentrations were significantly higher in Native Americans than in whites. Twenty-eight percent of 80 Alabama white hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity previously reported having Native American ancestry, but the possible effect of this ancestry on hemochromatosis phenotypes was unknown. We compiled observations in these 80 probands and used univariate and multivariate methods to analyze associations of age, sex, Native American ancestry (as a dichotomous variable), report of ethanol consumption (as a dichotomous variable), percentage transferrin saturation and loge serum ferritin concentration at diagnosis, quantities of iron removed by phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion, and quantities of excess iron removed by phlebotomy. In a univariate analysis in which probands were grouped by sex, there were no significant differences in reports of ethanol consumption, transferrin saturation, loge serum ferritin concentration, quantities of iron removed to achieve iron depletion, and quantities of excess iron removed by phlebotomy in probands who reported Native American ancestry than in those who did not. In multivariate analyses, transferrin saturation (as a dependent variable) was not significantly associated with any of the available variables, including reports of Native American ancestry and ethanol consumption. The independent variable quantities of excess iron removed by phlebotomy was significantly associated with loge serum ferritin used as a dependent variable (p < 0.0001), but not with reports of Native American ancestry or reports of ethanol consumption. Loge serum ferritin was the only independent variable significantly associated with quantities of excess iron removed by phlebotomy used as a dependent variable (p < 0.0001) (p < 0.0001; ANOVA of regression). We conclude that the iron-related phenotypes of hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity are similar in those with and without Native American ancestry reports.	16533407
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: screening and management.	Current hematology reports	2006	0.5	"""Hereditary hemochromatosis has been redefined over the past century, from a rare (but often fatal) disorder of iron overload known as """"bronzed diabetes"""" to only biochemical evidence of altered iron metabolism, and recently to mere expression of the C282Y homozygous genotype of the HFE gene. The variable definitions of the disease, as well as the variable degree of penetrance of the C282Y homozygous genotype, have made it difficult to determine optimal screening strategies. Multiple studies performed since discovery of the C282Y mutation have led to the conclusion that overall penetrance of the genotype is low and that screening of asymptomatic general populations for hereditary hemochromatosis is not recommended. Screening for HFE mutations among certain patient groups, including patients with cirrhosis, however, may help target those who would benefit most from iron removal. For most patients, phlebotomy is the preferred treatment option; iron chelation therapies are available for patients unable to tolerate phlebotomy."""	16537044
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased urinary excretion of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha in patients with HFE-related hemochromatosis: a case-control study.	Free radical biology & medicine	2006	0.5	The hypothesis according to which iron overload could be harmful has been extensively and controversially discussed in the literature. One underlying pathological mechanism may be elevated oxidative stress. Thus, we studied the correlation between hemochromatosis and an established marker of oxidative stress, 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha, iPF2alpha-III, 15-F2t-IsoP). We enrolled 21 patients with hemochromatosis, positive for the homozygous C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, and 21 healthy controls frequency-matched by age and gender in a case-control study design. The objective was to show that iron overload in HFE-related hemochromatosis is associated with increased oxidative stress assessed through 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) urinary excretion, and that oxidative stress is impacted by iron-removal treatment (phlebotomy). Study parameters were transferrin saturation, 8-iso-PGF(2alpha) urine excretion, transferrin, ferritin, serum iron, and vitamins A and E for all participants. Iron concentration in the liver and non-transferrin-bound iron were measured in patients only. We found a significant difference in 8-iso-PGF2alpha in patients (245 [interquartile range 157-348] pg/mg creatinine) compared with controls (128 [106-191] pg/mg creatinine, P = 0.002). Vitamin A was significantly reduced in cases (0.34 [0.25-1.83] microg/ml compared to 3.00 [2.11-3.39] microg/ml, P < 0.001), while vitamin E did not show a significant difference in cases (14.7 [11.5-18.1] microg/ml) compared with controls (14.9 [13.1-19.2] microg/ml, P = 0.52). After phlebotomy treatment and normalization of the iron parameters in the hemochromatosis group, serum vitamin A levels were significantly increased (1.36 [1.08-1.97] microg/ml, P = 0.035 vs. baseline, P < 0.001 vs. controls) and 8-iso-PGF2alpha urinary excretion was lowered to control levels (146 [117-198] pg/mg creatinine, P = 0.38 vs. controls). In our study, HFE-related hemochromatosis was associated with increased oxidative stress and hypovitaminemia A in C282Y homozygotes. The increased oxidative stress was reversible by normalization of the iron load by phlebotomy. Thus, phlebotomy is an effective and adequate means for reducing oxidative stress in these patients.	16545687
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hepatitis C, hemochromatosis and porphyria cutanea tarda].	Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)	2006	0.5	Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is characterized by decreased activity of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) and the accumulation of uro- and heptaporphyrins in the liver. Apart from increased alcohol exposure and certain drugs, PCT is associated with antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV), with its prevalence increasing from Northern (8-10%) to Southern Europe (71 to 91%). Chronic HCV-infection is thus considered to be a major trigger for PCT and PCT is said to be an important extrahepatic manifestation of HCV-infection in predisposed individuals. Iron overload is common in PCT. Iron is an inhibitory co-factor of URO-D activity in hepatocytes. Accordingly, in support of the critical role of iron, the clinical efficacy of iron removal is coupled to an improvement of hepatic URO-D activities. Up to two thirds of Saxon patients with PCT carry the classical hemochromatosis (HFE) mutations (C282Y and/or H63D). HFE genotyping can help to further classify patients with PCT and associated hemochromatosis. Simple or compound heterozygosity of HFE mutations does not affect the therapeutic response to chloroquine in PCT. Since Patients carrying homozygous mutations (C282Y/C282Y) with hemochromatosis and PCT do not respond to chloroquine, phlebotomy should be first-line treatment to remove toxic iron.	16555178
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Patient compliance with phlebotomy therapy for iron overload associated with hemochromatosis.	The American journal of gastroenterology	2003	0.5	The aim of this study was to evaluate patient compliance with phlebotomy therapy of hemochromatosis-associated iron overload. We reviewed medical records of white adults with hemochromatosis and iron overload diagnosed during medical care. We defined three elements of compliance: 1) achieving iron depletion (serum ferritin </= 20 ng/ml); 2) timeliness of phlebotomies on a weekly or biweekly schedule to achieve iron depletion; and 3) participation in therapy to maintain serum ferritin </= 50 ng/ml. We evaluated associations of timeliness of phlebotomy and participation in maintenance therapy with these variables: age at diagnosis, sex, pretreatment serum ferritin concentration, HFE genotype, units of blood removed to achieve iron depletion, and presence or absence of cirrhosis at diagnosis. A total of 118 patients were evaluable for iron depletion and 142 for maintenance therapy; 96.6% achieved iron depletion, and 33.1% and 43.2% followed weekly and biweekly schedules, respectively. Timeliness was not significantly associated with the variables we evaluated. In the first year of maintenance therapy, 84.0% of patients complied; the percentage of C282Y homozygotes complying was significantly greater than that of other patients. Average compliance with maintenance therapy decreased 6.8% annually; the mean follow-up after achieving iron depletion was 4.1 +/- 2.8 yr (range 0.6-9.7 yr). Most patients with hemochromatosis diagnosed in medical care achieve iron depletion with phlebotomy; one-third tolerate and adhere to weekly phlebotomy. There is a constant rate of decline in the percentage of patients who comply with maintenance therapy.	14499790
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A method for detecting recent selection in the human genome from allele age estimates.	Genetics	2003	4.64	Mutations that have recently increased in frequency by positive natural selection are an important component of naturally occurring variation that affects fitness. To identify such variants, we developed a method to test for recent selection by estimating the age of an allele from the extent of haplotype sharing at linked sites. Neutral coalescent simulations are then used to determine the likelihood of this age given the allele's observed frequency. We applied this method to a common disease allele, the hemochromatosis-associated HFE C282Y mutation. Our results allow us to reject neutral models incorporating plausible human demographic histories for HFE C282Y and one other young but common allele, indicating positive selection at HFE or a linked locus. This method will be useful for scanning the human genome for alleles under selection using the haplotype map now being constructed.	14504236
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations and Alzheimer's disease.	Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD	2006	0.5	An imbalance in brain iron status has been established in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This iron imbalance can impact plaque formation, amyloid processing, and expression of and response to inflammatory agents. In a more general sense, a deregulation of iron homeostasis underlies the generation of reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative damage. Thus, loss of iron homeostasis can be central to the pathogenic events in AD. Recently a number of studies have begun to investigate the frequency of mutations in the HFE gene in AD. Mutations in the HFE gene occur more frequently in Caucasians than any other mutation. The two most common mutations of HFE are the C282Y (2% of the total population) and the H63D (9%. Mutations in this gene are associated with loss of iron homeostasis, alterations in inflammatory responses and in its most severe form, a clinical disorder known as Hemochromatosis. The C282Y mutation is more frequently associated with Hemochromatosis and the frequency of the H63D mutation is receiving increasing attention in neurodegenerative disorders. This review summarizes the data on HFE mutations in neurodegenerative disorders and what is known about HFE in the brain and the cell biology underlying the HFE mutation.	17119292
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Evidence for non-HFE linked hemochromatosis in Asian Indians.	Indian journal of medical sciences	2006	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is commonly due to two HFE1 (Histone Family E1) gene mutations - H63D and C282Y. Mutations in the Asian Indians are less well studied. The aim of this preliminary study was to find out the prevalence of HFE gene mutations in nonviral liver cirrhosis patients. Unexplained liver cirrhosis cases with transferrin saturation> 45%, attending the gastroenterology clinic in the years 2004 and 2005 were subjects of the prospective study. Asymptomatic individuals with negative family history of hemolytic anemia or liver disease served as controls. The clinical presentation was recorded in the patients. Transferrin saturation was estimated by standard colorimetric technique. The two common mutations in HFE1 gene and Y250X mutation of TFR (transferrin receptor) gene were studied by polymerase chain reaction based methods. A majority of the cases were sporadic, but family history was positive in four patients. In one family with multiple affected members, there was clear evidence of autosomal dominant inheritance. Seven out of 31 (22.6%) of unexplained cirrhosis cases were positive for mutations. One was homozygous for H63D. In healthy controls, prevalence was 8.1% (6/74). None of the patients or controls was positive for C282Y mutation of HFE1 or Y250X of TFR gene. Thus, in a number of cases of hemochromatosis in Indians, a gene with dominant inheritance may be involved in causation of the phenotype. The prevalence of HFE mutations in Indians is comparable to that reported from neighboring countries. It is worth studying other mutations in HFE gene and other iron overload genes in cryptogenic cirrhosis cases.	17130663
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of Type 1 (HFE-related) hereditary haemochromatosis.	BMC medical genetics	2006	2.09	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a recessively-inherited disorder of iron over-absorption prevalent in Caucasian populations. Affected individuals for Type 1 HH are usually either homozygous for a cysteine to tyrosine amino acid substitution at position 282 (C282Y) of the HFE gene, or compound heterozygotes for C282Y and for a histidine to aspartic acid change at position 63 (H63D). Molecular genetic testing for these two mutations has become widespread in recent years. With diverse testing methods and reporting practices in use, there was a clear need for agreed guidelines for haemochromatosis genetic testing. The UK Clinical Molecular Genetics Society has elaborated a consensus process for the development of disease-specific best practice guidelines for genetic testing. A survey of current practice in the molecular diagnosis of haemochromatosis was conducted. Based on the results of this survey, draft guidelines were prepared using the template developed by UK Clinical Molecular Genetics Society. A workshop was held to develop the draft into a consensus document. The consensus document was then posted on the Clinical Molecular Genetics Society website for broader consultation and amendment. Consensus or near-consensus was achieved on all points in the draft guidelines. The consensus and consultation processes worked well, and outstanding issues were documented in an appendix to the guidelines. An agreed set of best practice guidelines were developed for diagnostic, predictive and carrier testing for hereditary haemochromatosis and for reporting the results of such testing.	17134494
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Heterozygous beta-globin gene mutations as a risk factor for iron accumulation and liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C.	Gut	2007	14.92	Iron accumulation is a well-known risk factor for the progression of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) to fibrosis. However, the profibrogenic role of the genes controlling iron homeostasis is still controversial. To evaluate the relative role of haemachromatosis (HFE), ferroportin and beta-globin gene mutations in promoting iron accumulation and fibrosis in patients with CHC. Genetic analysis was performed together with the assessment of hepatic iron content and histology in 100 consecutive HIV-antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients with biopsy-proven CHC. Among the patients investigated, 12 were heterozygous for various beta-globin gene mutations (39[C-->T], IVS1.1[G-->A], 22 7 bp deletion and IVS1.6[T-->C]) and 29 carried HFE (C282Y, H63D and S65C) gene mutations. One further patient was heterozygous for both HFE (H63D) and beta-globin (39[C-->T]) variants, whereas 58 had the wild-type alleles of both the genes. Hepatic iron concentration (HIC) and hepatic stainable iron were significantly higher (p<0.05) in patients with CHC carrying beta-globin mutations than in those with HFE mutations or the wild-type alleles. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the presence of beta-globin mutations was independently associated with both HIC (p = 0.008) and hepatic-stainable iron (odds ratio (OR) 6.11; 95% CI 1.56 to 23.92; p = 0.009). Moderate/severe fibrosis or cirrhosis (Ishak's score >2) was observed in 48 of 100 patients. Logistic regression demonstrated that age (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.09; p<0.005) and beta-globin mutations (OR 4.99; 95% CI 1.22 to 20.3; p = 0.025) were independent predictors of the severity of fibrosis. Heterozygosis for beta-globin mutations is a novel risk factor for both hepatic iron accumulation and the progression to fibrosis in patients with CHC.	17135308
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Mutations of hemochromatosis gene in volunteer blood donors and Chilean porphyria cutanea tarda patients].	Medicina	2006	0.5	In patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), hepatic iron accumulation associated to hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) could play a role in the etiology and in the clinical expression of the disease. The H63D and C282Y mutations of the HFE gene frequency were studied in a PCT group of patients and compared with the frequency observed in a group of volunteer blood donors. PCT patients were cataloged as hereditary or acquired PCT carriers, whether or not they presented uroporphyrinogen decarboxilase gene mutations. Fifty percent of PCT patients were carriers of the disease's genetic type. Such percentage is significantly higher than what other authors have previously informed. H63D and C282Y mutations were present in 23% and 2.4% of the volunteer blood donors, respectively. Similar frequencies were informed by others authors in Chilean white ethnic populations, and also in Spaniard and Argentinean populations, but significantly higher than that observed in Chile's Araucanean aboriginal population. Probably the frequency of H63D and C283Y mutations are related to the Spaniard ascendancy dominance of Chile's white ethnic population. The frequency of HFE gene mutations in PCT patients was not different than what was observed in volunteer blood donors. Similarly, there was no statistical difference in the frequency of these mutations among patients with acquired or genetic PCT disease. With the obtained results, it is not possible postulate an association between PCT and the hereditary hemochromatosis of HFE gene mutations carrier conditions.	17137171
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic screening for HFE hemochromatosis in 6,020 Danish men: penetrance of C282Y, H63D, and S65C variants.	Annals of hematology	2009	3.02	The aim of this epidemiologic population survey was to assess the penetrance of the most frequent hemochromatosis (HFE) gene variants in ethnic Danish men. A cohort of 6,020 men aged 30-53 years was screened for HFE C282Y, H63D, and S65C variants by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Subsequently, iron status markers (serum transferrin saturation, serum ferritin) were analyzed in 1,452 men. The C282Y allele was present in 5.6%, H63D in 12.8%, and S65C in 1.8% of the men. We found 23 out of 6,020 (0.38%) C282Y homozygotes, of whom two had been treated with phlebotomy. Among untreated C282Y homozygotes (n = 21) with available iron status markers (transferrin saturation n = 18, ferritin n = 16), 89% had elevated transferrin saturation >or=50%, 94% had elevated ferritin >or=300 microg/L, and 88% had elevation of both iron status markers; seven out of 16 (44%) had ferritin values >800 microg/L. One C282Y homozygote had normal iron status markers possibly due to nonexpressivity. Among C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes (n = 66), 23% had elevated transferrin saturation, 27% elevated ferritin, and 9% elevation of both iron status markers. Among H63D/H63D homozygotes (n = 74), 15% had elevated transferrin saturation, 19% elevated ferritin, and 5.4% elevation of both iron status markers. Among C282Y/wild type (wt) heterozygotes (n = 255), 9% had elevated transferrin saturation, 9% elevated ferritin, and 1.2% elevation of both iron status markers. Among H63D/wt heterozygotes (n = 600), 8% had elevated transferrin saturation, 12% elevated ferritin, and 2% elevation of both iron status markers. None of the men with the S65C variant displayed elevation of both iron status markers. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a high penetrance of the C282Y variant in Danish men followed by the H63D variant while the S65D variant had no significant impact on iron status markers.	19159930
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations and oxidative stress influence serum ferritin, associated with vascular damage, in hemodialysis patients.	American journal of nephrology	2007	2.6	Hyperferritinemia has been associated with cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether serum ferritin was affected by iron and oxidative status and by genetic factors (HFE mutations and the Ala9Val MnSOD polymorphism), and to assess the association between ferritin and cardiovascular damage evaluated by ecocolor-Doppler. 63 hemodialysis patients were tested for HFE and MnSOD genotype by restriction analysis and oxidative status; vascular damage was assessed by measuring intima-media thickness, and by detecting plaques at carotid and femoral arteries. Ferritin was correlated with transferrin saturation (p = 0.003), decreased iron-specific serum antioxidant activity (p = 0.01), age (p = 0.03), and C282Y and H63D HFE mutations (p = 0.05), but not with the MnSOD polymorphism. Ferritin was associated with advanced vascular damage, as evaluated by the presence of plaques, both at carotid (p = 0.03) and femoral arteries (p = 0.001), the other risk factors being age and low albumin. Low iron-specific antioxidant activity was associated with carotid plaques (p = 0.03). In hemodialysis patients, hyperferritinemia reflects a relative increase in iron availability and a decrease in iron-specific antioxidant activity, is favored by HFE mutations, and represents a risk factor for advanced cardiovascular damage.	17299255
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[HFE gene mutations in Tunisian major beta-Thalassemia and iron overload].	Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine	2006	0.56	In this study we have determined the allele frequency of HFE mutations H63D and C282Y in a group of Tunisian beta-thalassemia major patients. These two mutations are implicated in hereditary hemochromatosis among Caucasians. In this study we wanted to correlate these mutations with the iron status in major beta-thalassemia patients. Fifty Tunisian major beta-thalassemia were screening for the C282Y and H63D by digestion of polymerase chain reaction products (RFLP). Serum ferritin level was measured by immunoenzymatic microparticular essay. The allele frequency of H63D mutation was 17%. C282Y mutation was not present in our studied patients. No statistically significant difference of serum ferritin level was found between major beta-thalassemia with and without HFE mutations. Our results suggest that H63D mutation is so frequent in Tunisian major beta-thalassemia patients than in the general population and that the coinheritance of H63D mutation does not influence the severity of iron overload in these patients.	17303462
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum prohepcidin concentration: no association with iron absorption in healthy men; and no relationship with iron status in men carrying HFE mutations, hereditary haemochromatosis patients undergoing phlebotomy treatment, or pregnant women.	The British journal of nutrition	2007	0.5	Hepcidin plays a major role in iron homeostasis, but understanding its role has been hampered by the absence of analytical methods for quantification in blood. A commercial ELISA has been developed for serum prohepcidin, a hepcidin precursor, and there is interest in its potential use in the clinical and research arena. We investigated the association between serum prohepcidin concentration and iron absorption in healthy men, and its relationship with iron status in men carrying HFE mutations, hereditary haemochromatosis patients, and pregnant women. Iron absorption was determined in thirty healthy men (fifteen wild-type, fifteen C282Y heterozygote) using the stable isotope red cell incorporation technique. Iron status was measured in 138 healthy men (ninety-one wild-type, forty-seven C282Y heterozygote), six hereditary haemochromatosis patients, and thirteen pregnant women. Mean serum prohepcidin concentrations were 214 (SD 118) ng/ml [208 (SD 122) ng/ml in wild-type and 225 (SD 109) ng/ml in C282Y heterozygotes] in healthy men, 177 (SD 36) ng/ml in haemochromatosis patients, and 159 (SD 59) ng/ml in pregnant women. There was no relationship between serum prohepcidin concentration and serum ferritin in any subject groups, nor was it associated with efficiency of iron absorption. Serum prohepcidin is not a useful biomarker for clinical or research purposes.	17313717
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Cystathionine beta-synthase mutations in homocystinuria.	Human mutation	1999	5.09	The major cause of homocystinuria is mutation of the gene encoding the enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). Deficiency of CBS activity results in elevated levels of homocysteine as well as methionine in plasma and urine and decreased levels of cystathionine and cysteine. Ninety-two different disease-associated mutations have been identified in the CBS gene in 310 examined homocystinuric alleles in more than a dozen laboratories around the world. Most of these mutations are missense, and the vast majority of these are private mutations. The two most frequently encountered of these mutations are the pyridoxine-responsive I278T and the pyridoxine-nonresponsive G307S. Mutations due to deaminations of methylcytosines represent 53% of all point substitutions in the coding region of the CBS gene.	10338090
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Interpretation of iron studies in adolescent haemochromatosis.	Clinical and laboratory haematology	1999	0.5	We report the case of a 14-year-old girl who originally presented at the age of eight with a history of bloody stools, abdominal pain and weight loss. Initial iron studies showed raised serum iron and transferrin saturation but low ferritin and were interpreted as consistent with iron deficiency under treatment. As she had not taken any supplemental iron she later underwent genetic testing for the Cys282Tyr and His63Asp mutations of the HFE gene. On the basis of these results, she was diagnosed as having hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). This case highlights that a low serum ferritin does not exclude the diagnosis of HH and that the availability of genetic testing can now enable probands and affected family members to be identified.	10342073
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A novel mutation of HFE explains the classical phenotype of genetic hemochromatosis in a C282Y heterozygote.	Gastroenterology	1999	18.19	Most patients with genetic hemochromatosis are homozygous for a single mutation of the HFE gene (C282Y). There is a second mutation, H63D, but its role in iron overload is less conclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the basis of iron overload in a patient with classical hemochromatosis who was only heterozygous for C282Y and negative for H63D. Genotype for the C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations of HFE was determined in patient RFH, his family members, and 365 controls. The HFE gene was sequenced in patient RFH. Allele-specific reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to investigate RNA splicing. Allele frequency was determined by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. The patient is compound heterozygous for C282Y and a novel splice site mutation (IVS3 + 1G --> T). His sister has an identical genotype and elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. The novel mutation functionally alters messenger RNA splicing, causing obligate skipping of exon 3. However, the IVS3 + 1G --> T mutation was found to be rare and was not detected in 630 control European chromosomes. IVS3 + 1G --> T in the compound heterozygous state with C282Y results in iron overload that can progress to a severe phenotype of classical hemochromatosis. The demonstration of IVS3 +1G --> T highlights the possibility of other rare HFE mutations, particularly in C282Y heterozygotes with iron overload.	10348824
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genotyping as a diagnostic aid in genetic haemochromatosis.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	1999	3.32	Two mutations in a newly described gene, HFE, have been proposed as genetic markers for the inherited iron overload disease, genetic haemochromatosis. We assessed the frequency of both mutations in a cohort of genetic haemochromatosis patients and compared these with a control population. The patients were genetic haemochromatosis patients from Western Australia whose diagnosis met strict criteria for phenotypic expression. Control patients had other liver disease where iron overload was excluded. Genomic DNA of 72 genetic haemochromatosis patients and 69 controls was examined for the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene using polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction enzyme digestion. In genetic haemochromatosis patients, the C282Y mutation was homozygous in 64 of 72, giving a sensitivity of 89% (95% confidence interval 82-96%), heterozygous in five (7%) and absent in another three (4%), whereas none of the control subjects were homozygous. The H63D mutation was present in one genetic haemochromatosis patient and was not useful as a diagnostic marker. In this cohort of Western Australian patients with phenotypic expression of genetic haemochromatosis, the specificity of a homozygous C282Y mutation for genetic haemochromatosis was 100%. The results indicate that genotyping for the C282Y mutation is a useful test for the diagnosis of genetic haemochromatosis in clinical practice.	10355506
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis and ovarian cancer.	Women's health (London, England)	2011	0.5	Evaluation of: Gannon PO, Medelci S, Le Page C et al. Impact of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations on epithelial ovarian cancer risk and prognosis. Int. J. Cancer 128(10), 2326-2334 (2011). The frequency of two mutations (C282Y and D62H) of the hemochromatosis gene were investigated in women with ovarian cancer. A single allele mutation of the C282Y but not the H63D gene product was detected in 8-9% of women with benign ovarian tumors (n = 124) and ovarian cancers (n = 360) compared with 2.5% for controls (n = 80) representing a 4.9-fold increase in risk. With high-grade serous ovarian cancers (n = 179), the survival rate of women with a single allele C282Y mutation was reduced from 39 to 19 months. These results implicate mutations of the hemochromatosis gene in the generation and severity of ovarian cancers, which may have prognostic value.	21879820
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The prevalence of haemochromatosis gene mutations in the West of Scotland and their relation to ischaemic heart disease.	Heart (British Cardiac Society)	2003	0.5	Excess iron stores have been postulated to enhance the risk of ischaemic heart disease. This study aims to determine whether the two major mutations of the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene (C282Y and H63D) are associated with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or myocardial infarction (MI). Cross sectional case-control study. The geographical area studied by the MONICA (monitoring trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease) heart attack register for North Glasgow in Scotland, UK. 1009 control subjects chosen at random from general practitioner registers were studied. Additionally, 924 subjects who had survived a first MI sustained between 1985 and 1992 were identified from the MONICA register. C282Y and H63D mutations, previous MI, and presence or absence of IHD. Mutant gene prevalences in the whole control population were as follows: C282Y: homozygote 0.9%, heterozygote 17.7%; H63D: homozygote 2.1%, heterozygote 25.5%; and compound heterozygote: 2.4%. Analysis by chi(2) test and logistic regression analysis did not identify any significant difference in genotype prevalence between normal control, IHD control, and MI survivor groups. The C282Y homozygote and heterozygote prevalences are among the highest reported worldwide. No association between IHD or MI and HFE genotype was identified. However, these results need to be interpreted in the light of the cross sectional case-control nature of the study.	12923017
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Tumour necrosis factor alpha and its promoter polymorphisms' role in the phenotypic expression of hemochromatosis.	Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology	2003	2.2	The majority of hemochromatosis patients are homozygous for the HFE-C282Y mutation. However, less than half of C282Y homozygous subjects identified by population screening studies actually develop the disease. The cytokine TNF-alpha is implicated in the regulation of iron metabolism at different levels. Our aim was to study the role of TNF-alpha and its promoter polymorphisms in the phenotypic expression of hemochromatosis in individuals with and without the C282Y mutation. We studied 4 groups of 10 subjects each: (1) C282Y homozygotes without clinical hemochromatosis; (2) C282Y homozygotes with hemochromatosis; (3) secondary hemochromatosis (without C282Y mutation); and (4) controls. Groups were age-matched and sex-matched. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the release of TNF-alpha was measured. Additionally, the G/A polymorphisms at position -238 and -308 of the TNF-alpha, gene were determined by PCR and RFLP analysis in 178 hemochromatosis patients and 41 controls. TNF-alpha production from PBMC at 8 and 24 h after increasing concentrations of LPS stimulation were similar in the four groups. The prevalence of TNF-alpha polymorphisms was similar in patients and controls. The prevalences of cirrhosis, siderosis, median s-ferritin and median ALT values were similar in patients with and without the TNF-alpha polymorphisms. Neither TNF-alpha, released from PBMC nor the presence of TNF-alpha polymorphisms seem to be associated with disease manifestation in hemochromatosis.	12940442
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Over-expression of wild-type and mutant HFE in a human melanocytic cell line reveals an intracellular bridge between MHC class I pathway and transferrin iron uptake.	Biology of the cell	2003	2.55	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a frequent recessive disorder of iron metabolism characterised by systemic iron overload. In Northern Europe, more than 90% of HH patients are homozygous for a mis-sense mutation (C282Y) in the HFE1 gene product. The HFE protein is the heavy chain of a MHC class I-related molecule and associates with beta2 microglobulin and the transferrin receptor. Its precise roles in iron metabolism and in the pathophysiology of HH are still unclear. In order to identify the cellular processing of HFE, an important step towards the understanding of the function of the protein, we stably over-expressed the wild type and mutated forms fused to the Green Fluorescent Protein in a melanocytic MHC class I expressing cell line, the Mel Juso cell line. In wild type and mutant clones, the fusion proteins were not detected at the cell surface but only in the cytoplasm. Their sub-cellular localisation was determined by co-labelling of cells with organite-specific antibodies and confocal microscopy. HFE-GFP followed initially HLA class I intracellular processing but co-localised with transferrin in early endosomes without recycling at the cell surface. The C282Y-GFP fusion protein followed a different folding pathway to exit endoplasmic reticulum. Over-expression of the wild-type protein lead to a decrease in diferric transferrin uptake. Our model will be of use in the elucidation of the functional interaction between intracellular HFE and iron transporters transferrin/transferrin receptor complexes and Slc11A2 (also named N-Ramp2 or DMT1) in different endosomal compartments.	12941522
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Polymorphism of the HFE gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis in populations of Russia].	Genetika	2003	0.5	Expression of hereditary hemochromatosis as well as predisposition to iron overload syndrome and sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda are currently believed to be associated with the inheritance of certain allelic variants of the HFE gene. Allele frequencies of the C282Y (845A) and H63D (187G) mutations in the HFE gene in human populations of different races are remarkably different, and the prevalence of the S65C (193T) mutation is still poorly studied. In the present study we estimated allele frequencies of HFE mutations in Russians and in a number of Siberian ethnic indigenous populations. In Russians, allele frequencies of the C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations were 3.7, 13.3 and 1.7%, respectively. These values were similar to those observed in populations of Europe. The C282Y mutation was not detected in the population samples of Siberian ethnic groups, including Mansis, Khantys (Finno-Ugric group), Altaians, and Nivkhs (Mongoloids), suggesting that the frequency of this allele in the populations examined was lower than 1%. The frequency of the C282Y allele in the Tuvinian and Chukchi samples (Mongoloids) constituted 0.45 and 0.8%, respectively. Furthermore, pedigree analysis of both Chukchi carriers discovered showed that some of their ancestors were from other ethnic groups. Low frequencies of this allelic variant is typical of many Eastern Asian populations, which are also characterized by rather low frequencies of the H63D variant. In contrast, in some ethnic groups of Western Siberia allelic frequency of the H63D mutation is rather high, constituting 8.7% in Altaians, 15.5% in Mansis, and 11.3% in Khantys. The frequency of this allele in Tuvinians, Nivkhs, and Chukchis constituted 5, 4.7, and 0.8%, respectively. These findings make it possible to estimate the proportion of individuals predisposed to iron overload syndrome in different Russian ethnic groups. The HFE allele frequency distribution patterns observed in the populations examined pointed to pre-Celtic appearance of the CY82 allele. It also provides elucidation of the evolutionary genetic relationships between Siberian ethnic groups and the contemporary populations of Eastern and Western Europe.	12942784
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Heterozygosity for the Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene and the risk of colorectal cancer (Netherlands).	Cancer causes & control : CCC	2003	2.68	Heterozygosity for the Cys282Tyr transition in the HFE-gene is associated with slightly increased iron levels and may therefore be a potential risk factor for colorectal cancer. We studied the relationship between Cys282Tyr-heterozygosity and colorectal cancer using a case-control design. The 240 colorectal cancer cases and 635 controls in our study were derived from a prospective cohort study of 12,242 postmenopausal women, who were invited for an experimental breast cancer screening program in Utrecht, The Netherlands. The women were age 51-69 at time of inclusion and were followed for a period of 20 years. HFE genotyping was performed by PCR and allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization. The risk of colorectal cancer was higher for women who were heterozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation, than for those who were Cys282Tyr-wildtypes, although this was not statistically significant (Age-adjusted OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 0.6-2.2). Cys282Tyr-heterozygotes who smoked seemed to be at higher risk of colorectal cancer, although the p-value for interaction was not significant (p-value 0.42). The Cys282Tyr mutation is not associated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women, although in combination with smoking a slightly increased risk cannot be excluded.	12948285
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effects of hemochromatosis and transferrin gene mutations on peripheral iron dyshomeostasis in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.	Frontiers in aging neuroscience	2013	4.35	Deregulation of iron metabolism has been observed in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. We have carried out a molecular analysis investigating the interaction between iron specific gene variants [transferrin (TF, P589S), hemochromatosis (HFE) C282Y and (H63D)], iron biochemical variables [iron, Tf, ceruloplasmin (Cp), Cp:Tf ratio and % of Tf saturation (% Tf-sat)] and apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene variants in 139 Alzheimer's disease (AD), 27 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), 78 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 139 healthy controls to investigate mechanisms of iron regulation or toxicity. No difference in genetic variant distributions between patients and controls was found in our Italian sample, but the stratification for the APOEε4 allele revealed that among the APOEε4 carriers was higher the frequency of those carriers of at least a mutated TF P589S allele. Decreased Tf in both AD and MCI and increased Cp:Tf ratio in AD vs. controls were detected. A multinomial logistic regression model revealed that increased iron and Cp:Tf ratio and being man instead of woman increased the risk of having PD, that increased values of Cp:Tf ratio corresponded to a 4-fold increase of the relative risk of having MCI, while higher Cp levels were protective for PD and MCI. Our study has some limitations: the small size of the samples, one ethnic group considered, the rarity of some alleles which prevent the statistical power of some genetic analysis. Even though they need confirmation in larger cohorts, our data suggest the hypothesis that deregulation of iron metabolism, in addition to other factors, has some effect on the PD disease risk.	23935582
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Common variants in the BMP2, BMP4, and HJV genes of the hepcidin regulation pathway modulate HFE hemochromatosis penetrance.	American journal of human genetics	2007	10.79	Most cases of genetic hemochromatosis (GH) are associated with the HFE C282Y/C282Y (p.Cys282Tyr/p.Cys282Tyr) genotype in white populations. The symptoms expressed by C282Y homozygotes are extremely variable. Only a few suffer from an overt disease. Several studies have suggested that, in addition to environmental factors, a genetic component could explain a substantial part of this phenotypic variation, although very few genetic factors have been identified so far. In the present study, we tested the association between common variants in candidate genes and hemochromatosis penetrance, in a large sample of C282Y homozygotes, using pretherapeutic serum ferritin level as marker of hemochromatosis penetrance. We focused on two biologically relevant gene categories: genes involved in non-HFE GH (TFR2, HAMP, and SLC40A1) and genes involved in the regulation of hepcidin expression, including genes from the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) regulatory pathway (BMP2, BMP4, HJV, SMAD1, SMAD4, and SMAD5) and the IL6 gene from the inflammation-mediated regulation pathway. A significant association was detected between serum ferritin level and rs235756, a common single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the BMP2 genic region (P=4.42x10-5). Mean ferritin level, adjusted for age and sex, is 655 ng/ml among TT genotypes, 516 ng/ml in TC genotypes, and 349 ng/ml in CC genotypes. Our results further suggest an interactive effect on serum ferritin level of rs235756 in BMP2 and a SNP in HJV, with a small additive effect of a SNP in BMP4. This first reported association between common variants in the BMP pathway and iron burden suggests that full expression of HFE hemochromatosis is linked to abnormal liver expression of hepcidin, not only through impairment in the HFE function but also through functional modulation in the BMP pathway. Our results also highlight the BMP regulation pathway as a good candidate for identification of new modifier genes.	17847004
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Pearson syndrome in an infant heterozygous for C282Y allele of HFE gene.	Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	2007	0.5	Pearson syndrome is a rare mitochondrial disorder characterized by sideroblastic anemia, liver disease, renal tubulopathy and exocrine pancreas deficiency. We describe a female infant suffering from anemia since birth who gradually developed the complete picture of Pearson syndrome by 13 months. Iron overload was disproportionate to blood transfusions. The patient was heterozygous for HFE gene C282Y mutation (type I hemochromatosis). After an initial response to deferoxamine she presented with cutaneous zygomycosis and died after metabolic derangement and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. This is the second case of a Pearson syndrome individual who was also heterozygous for HFE gene mutation C282Y published. It is also the second case report of a Pearson patient suffering from severe iron overload and liver disease that responded to therapy with deferoxamine.	17852457
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepatic damage in C282Y homozygotes relates to low numbers of CD8+ cells in the liver lobuli.	European journal of clinical investigation	2001	2.69	Although most Caucasian patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) show the same mutation in the HFE gene, the phenotypic expression of the disease varies greatly. We have previously shown that patients with HH who have high iron stores have low numbers of circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes. Liver and peripheral blood were studied in 37 C282Y homozygous HH patients; nine normal livers and 11 livers from patients with cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus or alcoholic liver disease were also investigated. Eleven jejunal biopsies from HH patients and 17 normal biopsies were studied. The numbers of CD8+ cells were determined in peripheral blood by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, and in the liver or small intestine by immunohistochemistry. In HH patients the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood correlated significantly with the number of CD8+ cells in the liver lobuli but not with that in the small intestine. Body iron stores correlated negatively with the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood and in the liver, but not with the number in the small intestine. HH patients with cirrhosis had the lowest CD8+ cell count in liver sections, in contrast with other forms of cirrhosis. The results indicate that HH patients with the HFE C282Y mutation and low numbers of CD8+ cells in the liver lobuli have higher iron stores and are more prone to develop liver cirrhosis.	11168438
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Heterozygosity for the hemochromatosis gene in liver diseases--prevalence and effects on liver histology.	Liver	2000	0.5	The effect of heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE hemochromatosis gene on iron accumulation and disease progression in liver disease patients is unclear. We investigated the prevalence of this mutation in 531 patients and 205 healthy controls. In addition, we assessed the influence of the mutation on liver histology in 34 C282Y heterozygous and 124 age-, sex- and disease-matched controls without the mutation using the modified HAI and Chevallier score. The highest prevalence of the C282Y mutation was observed in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (17.2%, p<0.01) compared to 6.4% in healthy controls. Heterozygotes with hepatitis C and B virus infection showed higher ferritin and hepatic iron concentrations than patients without the mutation. However, we did not detect significant differences in necroinflammatory or fibrosis scores between carriers of the mutation and controls. There are marked differences in the prevalence of the C282Y mutation in patients with different liver diseases, with the highest prevalence rates in autoimmune hepatitis and PBC. However, the C282Y mutation alone only leads to a mild increase in iron accumulation in the majority of the patients, with the exception of H63D/C282Y compound heterozygotes. We found no evidence for more pronounced fibrosis in C282Y heterozygotes.	11169063
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Uroporphyria in Hfe mutant mice given 5-aminolevulinate: a new model of Fe-mediated porphyria cutanea tarda.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2001	0.5	Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a liver disease with skin lesions caused by excess liver production of uroporphyrin (URO), is associated with consumption of alcoholic beverages or estrogens, and moderate iron overload. Recently, it has been shown that many PCT patients carry mutations in the HFE gene, which is responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis. Mice homozygous for either the null mutation in the Hfe gene or the C282Y missense mutation rapidly accumulate hepatic parenchymal iron similar to patients with hemochromatosis. Here we investigated whether disruption of the murine Hfe gene would result in hepatic uroporphyria. Mice homozygous for the Hfe-null mutation accumulated high levels of hepatic URO when fed 5-aminolevulinate (ALA). Hfe (+/-) mice also accumulated hepatic URO when fed ALA, but at a much slower rate. The amount of accumulated URO in the null mutant mice was similar to that in wild-type mice treated with iron carbonyl in the diet, or injected with iron dextran. Iron in both wild-type and Hfe (+/-) mice was mostly in Kupffer cells. In contrast, Hfe (-/-) mice had considerable parenchymal iron deposition as well, in a pattern similar to that observed in wild-type mice treated with iron carbonyl. URO accumulation was accompanied by 84% and 33% decreases in hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activities in Hfe (-/-) and Hfe (+/-) mice, respectively. No increases in CYP1A2 or other cytochrome P450s were detected in the Hfe-null mutant mice. We conclude that this experimental model of uroporphyria is a valid model for further investigations into the mechanism of PCT.	11172342
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Analysis of the HFE gene in a large Spanish kindred with hereditary hemochromatosis].	Medicina clinica	2001	1.27	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an inborn error of iron metabolism that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Recently, it has been shown that the HFE gene, located telomeric to HLA-A on chromosome 6 is mutated in most patients with HH. Moreover, the phenotypic expression of hereditary hemochromatosis is influenced by sex and environmental agents such as alcohol and dietary iron intake. We have studied 40 subjects from a family some of which members have HH. DNA was obtained from nucleated peripheral blood cells, and exons 2 and 4 and intron 5 of the HFE gene were amplified by PCR and digested with specific restriction enzymes. Analysis of the HFE gene revealed that 29 members of the family carry some of the three HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D and S65C). Nevertheless, only those homozygous for the C282Y mutation develop HH. In this family, the allele 187G of exon 2 mutation is cosegregated with the allele IVS5-47 A in intron 5. Analysis of the HFE gene in the members of a large Spanish kindred, living in the same geographical area, shows that only those homozygous for the C282Y mutation develop hemochromatosis.	11181289

Pathology	2000	2.97	Since 1996, the identification of the HFE gene has enabled DNA testing for hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). The range of DNA testing available includes: (1) diagnostic, (2) predictive (also called presymptomatic testing) and (3) screening. Access to DNA testing has been facilitated by an Australian Medicare rebate, the first available for genetic disorders. Despite the availability of HFE DNA testing in HH, it remains necessary to interpret results in the context of the clinical picture. Traditional markers based on phenotype (transferrin ferritinsaturation, and liver biopsy) are still required in some circumstances. We report our experience with HFE DNA testing using a semi-automated approach, which allows multiplexing for the two common mutations (C282Y and H63D). Screening a cohort of beta-thalassaemia major and sickle cell anaemia patients of predominantly Mediterranean origin showed that these individuals do not have the common C282Y mutation. This excluded C282Y as a factor in the pathogenesis of iron overload in these haemoglobinopathies. It also showed that the C282Y mutation is of limited value when investigating HH in certain ethnic groups. An Australian family studied illustrated the relative contribution of C282Y and H63D in iron overload. A recently reported third mutation (S65C) in the HFE gene was detected in a low frequency in the populations tested.	11186424
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of the Cys282Tyr and His63Asp mutation in Flemish patients with hereditary hemochromatosis.	Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica		0.71	Recently Feder et al. have identified the gene responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis; it is located 3 Mbp telomeric of the MHC region on chromosome 6p and is called the HFE gene. The majority of the patients with hemochromatosis harbour the same missense mutation, Cys282Tyr. A second missense mutation (His63Asp) of which the significance is less clear, has also been described. To our knowledge the percentage of these two missense mutations in Flemish hemochromatosis patients is not known. Forty nine (49) unrelated patients with the clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis were screened for the two missense mutations. The missense mutations were diagnosed with a PCR technique. Of the 49 patients, 46 patients were homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation (94%), 2 were heterozygous (4%) and 1 carried two normal alleles (2%). Of the 3 patients not homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation, 3 were heterozygous for the His63Asp mutation (2 patients were 'compound heterozygotes'). The percentage of homozygotes (Cys282Tyr) in a Flemish hemochromatotic population is comparable with the figures published in the literature. The second missense mutation (His63Asp) could be of importance in association with the Cys282Tyr missense mutation.	11189980
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene variants in patients with cardiomyopathy.	The American journal of cardiology	2001	0.5	Iron depletion was suggested to be protective against the development of ischemic heart disease. Population studies have led to conflicting results, and such an association has not been addressed in patients with heart failure due to cardiomyopathy. We studied the distribution of hemochromatosis-related mutations in 319 patients with heart failure due to cardiomyopathy of different etiologies. The genotypic distribution showed a significantly higher prevalence of heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy than in patients with cardiomyopathy of nonischemic etiologies (p = 0.0036). The frequency of the D63 mutation was not significantly different between ischemic versus nonischemic groups. In multiple logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, and different degrees of disease progression, there was a strong and significant association of the C282Y mutation with ischemic cardiomyopathy compared with the nonischemic group (odds ratio 6.64, 95% confidence interval 1.71 to 25.73, after adjustment). In our sample, genetic variation in the HFE gene was associated with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Such association merits further study regarding its value as a prognostic marker in patients with ischemic heart disease.	11545759
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic hemochromatosis, a Celtic disease: is it now time for population screening?	Genetic testing	2001	0.5	In populations of northern European ancestry, hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is tightly linked to mutations within the hemochromatosis gene (HFE gene). Over 93% of Irish HH patients are homozygous for the HFE gene C282Y mutation, providing a reliable diagnostic marker of the disease in this population. However, the prevalence of the C282Y mutation and that of the second HFE gene mutation, H63D, have yet to be determined within the Irish population. The objective of this study was to identify the true prevalence of the genetic form of HH in the Irish population. DNA was extracted from 1002 randomly selected newborn screening cards and analyzed for the C282Y and H63D mutations within the HFE gene. Complete results were obtained from 800 cards. Mutations were identified in 364 (46%) neonates. Eight (1%) neonates were homozygous for C282Y and 8 (1%) were homozygous for H63D. One hundred and fifty-five (19%) neonates were C282Y heterozygous and 226 (28%) were H63D heterozygous. Of these, 33 (4%) carried one copy of both C282Y and H63D mutations, i.e., compound heterozygous. Allele frequencies for C282Y and H63D were 11% and 15%, respectively. The high C282Y allele frequency in the Irish population together with its close linkage to HH indicate that C282Y genotyping is the preferred screening strategy for this disease in Ireland.	11551098
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of HFE mutations in people from North Africa living in southern France.	British journal of haematology	2001	5.4	The two main mutations of the HFE (haemochromatosis) gene, C282Y and H63D, were found previously to be rare or absent among Africans. Dried blood samples of 1276 newborns from southern France were analysed for both HFE mutations, and the origins of the four grandparents of each newborn were recorded. The allele frequency of C282Y and H63D was 3.0% +/- 0.7% and 16.9% +/- 1.5% respectively. In a subgroup of 171 newborns with four North African ancestries (mainly from Morocco and Algeria) the allele frequency was 0.9%+2.5%-0.2% for the C282Y and 13.2% +/- 3.6% for H63D. HFE mutations are not absent in individuals with North African origins living in southern Europe. This finding has implications for the diagnosis and screening of hereditary haemochromatosis in these populations.	11564085
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between Cys282Tyr missense mutation and haptoglobin phenotype polymorphism in patients with chronic hepatitis C.	European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	2001	2.09	In patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, the haptoglobin (Hp) 1-1 phenotype is overrepresented. Data regarding the occurrence of the Cys282Tyr missense mutation in these patients are less clear. We studied the prevalence of both variables in a cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis C and looked for interaction between the two variables. The study group consisted of 142 patients chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus. All patients were examined for the occurrence of the Cys282Tyr missense mutation, and in 132 of them the Hp phenotype was determined. The Cys282Tyr missense mutation was detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and RsaI digestion. Hp phenotypes were determined using starch gel electrophoresis of haemoglobin-supplemented serum followed by peroxidase staining. A significant overrepresentation of the Hp 1-1 phenotype was found (36/132, 27%, P < 0.01 v. control population). This overrepresentation was observed only in the patients homozygous for the wild-type allele of the HFE gene. The Cys282Tyr allele was significantly overrepresented in hepatitis C patients (0.12 v. 0.07, P < 0.05) and principally in patients with the Hp 2-1 and 2-2 phenotypes. In patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, both the Hp 1-1 and the Cys282Tyr allele occur more frequently than in a control population. Remarkably, these genes seem to determine each other's occurrence, such that the overrepresentation of the Hp 1-1 phenotype is seen only in Cys282Tyr-negative subjects, while the overrepresentation of the Cys282Tyr allele is observed in Hp 1-1-negative subjects. Differences in immunomodulating and in oxidative stress-inducing capacities between the two genes may explain this finding.	11564959
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	The molecular basis of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency in Dutch patients with homocystinuria: effect of CBS genotype on biochemical and clinical phenotype and on response to treatment.	American journal of human genetics	1999	10.79	Homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, is the most prevalent inborn error of methionine metabolism. Its diverse clinical expression may include ectopia lentis, skeletal abnormalities, mental retardation, and premature arteriosclerosis and thrombosis. This variability is likely caused by considerable genetic heterogeneity. We investigated the molecular basis of CBS deficiency in 29 Dutch patients from 21 unrelated pedigrees and studied the possibility of a genotype-phenotype relationship with regard to biochemical and clinical expression and response to homocysteine-lowering treatment. Clinical symptoms and biochemical parameters were recorded at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Of 10 different mutations detected in the CBS gene, 833T-->C (I278T) was predominant, present in 23 (55%) of 42 independent alleles. At diagnosis, homozygotes for this mutation (n=12) tended to have higher homocysteine levels than those seen in patients with other genotypes (n=17), but similar clinical manifestations. During follow-up, I278T homozygotes responded more efficiently to homocysteine-lowering treatment. After 378 patient-years of treatment, only 2 vascular events were recorded; without treatment, at least 30 would have been expected (P<.01). This intervention in Dutch patients significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and other sequelae of classical homocystinuria syndrome.	10364517
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotype in patients with hemochromatosis and other liver diseases.	Annals of internal medicine	1999	16.44	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common inherited disorder of iron metabolism. The gene HFE, which contains two missense mutations (C282Y and H63D), was recently identified. To determine how HFE genotyping for the C282Y and H63D mutations contributes to the diagnosis of hemochromatosis and to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in a group of patients with liver disease. Cross-sectional study. Academic medical center. 66 patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and 132 referred patients with other liver diseases. At initial diagnosis, fasting transferrin saturation, ferritin level, routine chemistry panel, and complete blood count were determined. Percutaneous liver biopsy was done on all patients for histologic analysis and measurement of hepatic iron concentration and hepatic iron index. HFE genotyping for the C282Y and H63D mutations was done on all patients by using genomic DNA samples. Of the 66 patients with hemochromatosis diagnosed on the basis of serum iron studies and liver biopsy findings, 60 (91%) were C282Y homozygotes, 2 (3%) were compound heterozygotes, 1 (1.5%) was a C282Y heterozygote, 2 (3%) were H63D heterozygotes, and 1 (1.5%) was negative for both mutations. Of the 132 patients with liver disease, 6 (5%) were C282Y homozygotes, 8 (6%) were compound heterozygotes, 6 (5%) were C282Y heterozygotes, 5 (4%) were H63D homozygotes, 20 (15%) were H63D heterozygotes, and 87 (66%) were negative for both mutations. All 66 C282Y homozygotes had an elevated hepatic iron concentration, and 65 of the 66 patients (98%) had a transferrin saturation of at least 45%. Ten of the 66 patients (15% [95% CI, 7.5% to 26%]) had a hepatic iron index less than 1.9 mmol/kg per year; hemochromatosis was not suspected in 6 of the 10 patients before genotyping. Cirrhosis or substantial hepatic fibrosis was not seen in any (0% [CI, 0% to 18%]) of the 19 patients younger than 40 years of age who were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. All 66 patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation of HFE had an elevated hepatic iron concentration, but approximately 15% of these patients did not meet a previous diagnostic criterion for hemochromatosis (hepatic iron index > 1.9 mmol/kg per year). Determination of HFE genotype is clinically useful in patients with liver disease and suspected iron overload and may lead to identification of otherwise unsuspected C282Y homozygotes.	10383365
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Interaction between haemochromatosis and transferrin receptor genes in different neoplastic disorders.	Carcinogenesis	1999	4.87	A number of genes are involved in iron metabolism, including the transferrin receptor (TFR) and haemochromatosis (HFE) genes. In previous investigations an increased risk for neoplastic disease has been observed in individuals homo- and heterozygous for hereditary haemochromatosis. The HFE wild-type gene product complexes with the transferrin receptor (TF) and two different HFE mutations (Cys282Tyr and His63Asp) have been found to increase the affinity of TFR for TF and increase cellular iron uptake. In a recent study we found no associations for HFE and TFR separately, but an interaction between HFE and TFR genotypes in multiple myeloma. Individuals carrying the HFE Tyr282 allele (homo- and heterozygotes) in combination with homozygosity for the TFR Ser142 allele had an increased risk. In the present study the same association was found in breast and colorectal cancer. The odds ratio for all three neoplasms combined was 2.0 (95% CI 1.0-3.8). The risk for neoplastic disease was further increased (OR 7.7, 95% CI = 1.0-59.9) when the analysis was restricted to HFE Tyr homozygotes and compound heterozygotes in combination with TFR Ser homozygosity. Thus, an interaction between HFE and TFR alleles may increase the risk for different neoplastic disorders.	10383894
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Correlation of hemochromatosis gene mutations and cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients.	Annals of Saudi medicine		0.31	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of death in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations are reported to be associated with CVD. The present study aims to investigate the association of HFE gene polymorphism with CVD in HD patients. Cross-sectional case-control. C282Y/H63D mutations of HFE gene were evaluated in 560 HD patients and 480 healthy controls from 4 HD centers in North China. The results obtained from this evaluation process were correlated with biochemical parameters including iron status (serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin concentration), cardiovascular disease, and inflammation marker CRP, IL-6, TNF-a. No C282Y mutations were detected in HD patients or healthy controls in this study. The genotype of H63D heterozygous mutation was similar in HD patients with CVD, HD patients without CVD, and controls. H63D homozygous mutation was 7.4% (19/257), 3.1% (9/303), and 1.0% (5/480) for the 3 groups, respectively. Compound heterozygosity was not found in this study. The relative risk for CVD in HD patients with H63D homozygous mutation was 2.59 (95% CI: 1.15-5.84). H63D homozygous mutation had significantly higher serum ferritin concentrations compared with wild-type individuals. Moreover, HD patients had significantly higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP, IL-6, and TNF-a. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that H63D mutation instead of ferritin level was an independent risk factor of CVD for HD patients. Our study demonstrates for the first time that there was an association between H63D homozygous mutations and CVD in HD patients. Elevated serum CRP, IL-6, and TNF-a levels were also related to CVD in HD patients.	23793422
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The prevalence of primary hereditary hemochromatosis in central Anatolia.	The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology	2013	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with the HFE genes. Early identification and diagnosis is important as end stage organ damage may occur if treatment is delayed.. This study aimed to identify the prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis in Kayseri and surroundings known as Central Anatolia. 2304 participants (1220 males, 1084 females) who were older then the age of 17 were included in the study conducted between December 2005 and December 2006 in Kayseri, Turkey. Transferin saturation was measured from overnight fasting blood samples. Serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and transferin saturation were measured. Serum ferritin levels and hereditary hemochromatosis genetic analysis were also performed after an overnight fasting blood samples from participants whose transferin saturation results were more than 50% in man and more than 45% in women. The homozygote C282Y mutation and heterozygote C282Y mutation prevalences were found as 0.08% (1/1220) and 0.08% (1/1220) in male participants, respectively. The heterozygote H63D mutation prevalence was found in 0.09% (1/1084) of female participants. Calculated prevalences in general population are as follows; The homozygote C282Y mutation prevalence is 0.043% (1/2304), the heterozygote C282Y mutation prevalence is 0.043% (1/2304) and the heterozygote H63D mutation prevalence is 0.043% (1/2304). The prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis in Central Anatolia is 0.043% (1/2304). Because of the relatively low frequency, population screening studies are not cost-effective.	23794343
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Total mortality by elevated transferrin saturation in patients with diabetes.	Diabetes care	2013	8.93	It is not known to what extent iron overload predicts prognosis in patients with diabetes after diagnosis or whether iron overload is a risk factor independent of the HFE genotype. We investigated total and cause-specific mortality according to increased transferrin saturation (≥ 50 vs. <50%), whether mortality is driven by the HFE genotype, and whether early measurement of transferrin saturation helps to predict mortality outcome. Cohort 1 included patients with late-onset type 1 diabetes (n = 716) with a cross-sectional measurement of transferrin saturation and HFE genotype. Cohort 2 included consecutively recruited patients with any diabetes (n = 6,120), transferrin saturation measurement at referral, and HFE genotype if transferrin saturation was above 50%. In cohort 1, the hazard ratio for total mortality was 2.3 (95% CI 1.3-3.9; P = 0.002) and for cause-specific mortality by neoplasms was 5.8 (2.4-14; P = 0.00007) in patients with transferrin saturation ≥ 50 vs. <50%. Excluding genotypes C282Y/C282Y and C282Y/H63D gave similar results. The hazard ratio for total mortality was 4.0 (1.2-13; P = 0.01) and for cause-specific mortality by neoplasms was 13 (3.6-49; P = 0.0001) in patients with C282Y/C282Y versus wild type. In cohort 2, total mortality was not different in patients with transferrin saturation ≥ 50 vs. <50%. In patients with late-onset type 1 diabetes and transferrin saturation ≥ 50%, the hazard ratio for total mortality was 0.4 (0.2-0.9; P = 0.03) in cohort 2 versus cohort 1. Increased transferrin saturation and HFE genotype C282Y/C282Y predict total mortality in patients with late-onset type 1 diabetes, and increased transferrin saturation after diagnosis is an independent risk factor. Early measurement of transferrin saturation in these patients leading to early intervention improves life expectancy.	23801727
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis gene mutations and risk of coronary artery disease.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2000	4.58	The identification of mutations in the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) (C282Y and H63D) provides the unique opportunity to test whether genetic variants that are associated with tissue iron accumulation may influence the risk of coronary atherosclerosis. To this aim the prevalence of C282Y and H63D mutations was determined in 174 patients with angiographically documented CAD (>50% stenosis) and history of MI, 187 healthy free-living individuals and 142 blood donors. C282Y and H63D mutations were not found to be more frequent in coronary patients as compared to controls. Moreover, these HFE variants were unrelated to the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. These findings did not provide evidence of an association between HFE mutations and the presence of coronary atherosclerosis or its major ischaemic complications, thus indicating that HFE mutations are poor genetic markers of coronary risk.	10854101
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Are hereditary hemochromatosis mutations involved in Alzheimer disease?	American journal of medical genetics	2000	0.5	Mutations in the class I-like major histocompatibility complex gene called HFE are associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC), a disorder of excessive iron uptake. We screened DNA samples from patients with familial Alzheimer disease (FAD) (n = 26), adults with Down syndrome (DS) (n = 50), and older (n = 41) and younger (n = 52) healthy normal individuals, for two HHC point mutations-C282Y and H63D. Because the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) E4 allele is a risk factor for AD and possibly also for dementia of the AD type in DS, DNA samples were also ApoE genotyped. Chi-squared analyses were interpreted at the 0.05 level of significance without Bonferroni corrections. In the pooled healthy normal individuals, C282Y was negatively associated with ApoE E4, an effect also apparent in individuals with DS but not with FAD. Relative to older normals, ApoE E4 was overrepresented in both males and females with FAD, consistent with ApoE E4 being a risk factor for AD; HFE mutations were overrepresented in males and underrepresented in females with FAD. Strong gender effects on the distribution of HFE mutations were apparent in comparisons among ApoE E4 negative individuals in the FAD and healthy normal groups (P < 0.002). Our findings are consistent with the proposition that among ApoE E4 negative individuals HFE mutations are predisposing to FAD in males but are somewhat protective in females. Further, ApoE E4 effects in our FAD group are strongest in females lacking HFE mutations. Relative to younger normals there was a tendency for ApoE E4 and H63D to be overrepresented in males and underrepresented in females with DS. The possibility that HFE mutations are important new genetic risk factors for AD should be pursued further.	10861683
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Genetics and physiopathology of hemochromatosis].	La Revue du praticien	2000	0.5	Thanks to the discovery of the HFE gene and of its mutations, it is now established that the most frequent form of hemochromatosis is related to homozygosity for the mutation C282Y, and that other types of hemochromatosis, unrelated to HFE mutations, do exist such as the juvenile hemochromatosis. From a pathophysiological standpoint, the C282Y mutation impairs HFE protein expression at the surface of the membrane and disturbs the cellular entry of iron (carried by circulating transferrin) into the cryptic duodenal cell. This, in turn, is likely to lead to an aberrant programmation of the degree of iron influx from the digestive lumen into the apical duodenal cells. The resulting hyperabsorption, which forms the basis of iron overload in hemochromatosis, is likely to implicate an overexpression of the transmembrane iron carrier DMT1. It is remarkable to observe that these major improvements in the knowledge of hemochomatosis have been accompanied by similar improvements in the understanding of normal iron metabolism.	10865496
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Diagnosis and treatment of genetic hemochromatosis].	La Revue du praticien	2000	0.5	Genetic hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease, characterized by an increased iron absorption, leading to progressive iron overload. The fully expressed phenotype comprises fatigue, skin pigmentation, liver disease with hepatomegaly, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and diabetes. Arthralgias are frequent, cardiopathy or impotence may occur. This presentation is now unfrequent with earlier diagnosis, and patients are often asymptomatic--with only biochemical expression--or pauci-symptomatic (mild fatigue, arthralgias or increased transaminases). Transferrin saturation is always increased. Serum ferritin is proportional to iron burden. Diagnosis is now easy, since most patients are homozygote for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. Liver biopsy can be useful to quantify iron overload and assess liver fibrosis. The disease can be lethal due to liver disease, carcinoma or heart disease, but life expectancy goes to normal if patients are treated before the occurrence of cirrhosis. Treatment relies on regular venesections. Familial screening is essential.	10865497
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Relation between HFE mutations and mild iron-overload expression.	Molecular genetics and metabolism	2000	3.09	The identification of the HFE gene involved in hemochromatosis allows genetic tests based on mutation analysis to be performed. However, discrepancies in the correlation between HFE genotypes and iron-loading status have arisen. We investigated 708 patients with various signs or symptoms suggesting a putative iron overload that, nevertheless, did not reach the current criteria for hemochromatosis diagnosis. Most of the patients (91.4%) included in our study displayed one of three classical iron marker values above the threshold defined for iron overloading. HFE mutation analysis allowed us to identify 45.7% of carrier chromosomes in the studied group of patients that showed higher frequencies of HFE mutations compared with controls. In addition, the frequencies of compound C282Y/H63D heterozygous, H63D/H63D homozygous, and C282Y heterozygous genotypes were higher than those in HH probands and controls; they accounted for 16, 5.6, and 22.5% of the patients, respectively. All genotypic groups had a significantly higher value of serum ferritin concentration compared to the normal value; only the C282Y homozygotes and compound heterozygotes with H63D had a transferrin saturation significantly higher than the normal value. On the whole the H63D homozygous and compound heterozygous patients constitute an intermediate phenotypic group between HH and controls. Some of them may reach the critical overloading defined for HH diagnosis along with a potential risk of developing complications, whereas others only show a partial phenotypic expression.	10870847
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Liver transplantation for hereditary hemochromatosis.	Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society	2001	3.95	Although hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is relatively common, it is an uncommon indication for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). The diagnosis of HHC in patients with end-stage liver disease is difficult because many of these patients have elevated serum and tissue iron levels. Of patients undergoing OLT with iron stores in the range typical for HHC, approximately 10% are homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Most studies published to date noted decreased survival in patients who underwent OLT for HHC compared with those who underwent OLT for other indications. Death in patients with HHC was caused by increased infectious and cardiac complications. Decreased post-OLT survival in patients with iron overload appears to be independent of HFE gene status. This suggests that regardless of the cause, iron overload may be detrimental in patients undergoing OLT. Follow-up of patients undergoing OLT for HHC and case reports of the inadvertent transplantation of a liver from a donor with HHC has furthered our understanding of the pathophysiological state of iron overload in HHC.	11510009
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hyperferritinemia, iron overload, and multiple metabolic alterations identify patients at risk for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.	The American journal of gastroenterology	2001	0.5	The aim of this study was to define in patients with hyperferritinemia and normal transferrin saturation the relationships among hyperferritinemia, iron overload, HFE gene mutations, the presence of metabolic alterations, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Forty patients with increased serum ferritin, resistant to dietary restriction and normal transferrin saturation, 90 with ultrasonographic evidence of hepatic steatosis, and 60 obligate heterozygotes for hemochromatosis, all negative for alcohol abuse, hepatitis virus infections, and inflammation were studied. Transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, uric acid, lipids, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, HFE gene mutations, liver histology, and hepatic iron concentration were analyzed. Of the 40 patients with hyperferritinemia, 29 (72%) had biochemical metabolic abnormalities, 18 of the 26 examined (69%) had insulin resistance, 26 (65%) had the presence of one of the two HFE gene mutations (normal controls, 33 of 128 [26%], p < 0.0001), and all had increased liver iron concentration. Thirty-one patients (77%) had histology compatible with NASH. At univariate analysis, NASH was significantly associated with the presence of metabolic alterations, the C282Y mutation, and severity of fibrosis. At multivariate analysis, NASH was associated with the coexistence of multiple metabolic alterations (odds ratio = 5.2, 95% CI = 0.95-28.7). The risk of having NASH augmented in the presence of higher values of ferritin and liver iron concentration. Among the 90 patients with ultrasonographic evidence of hepatic steatosis, 24 (27%) had increased serum ferritin with normal transferrin saturation, but only six remained hyperferritinemic after dietary restriction. Increased ferritin with normal transferrin saturation is frequently found in patients with hepatic steatosis, but it reflects iron overload only in those patients in whom it persists despite an appropriate diet. The simultaneous disorder of iron and glucose and/or lipid metabolism, in most of the cases associated with insulin resistance, is responsible for persistent hyperferritinemia and identifies patients at risk for NASH.	11513189

Clinical chemistry	2001	7.46	Between 4% and 35% of hereditary hemochromatosis (HC) probands are C282Y or H63D heterozygotes or lack both of these two common HFE mutations, and 15 novel HFE mutations have been described recently. We evaluated denaturing HPLC (DHPLC) for screening of the whole HFE coding region and further defined whether HC probands with an incomplete HFE genotype carry uncommon mutations. Analytical conditions for each coding exon were determined by a combination of computer melting profile predictions and experimental melting curves. To test accuracy for scanning the complete HFE coding region and optimize DHPLC running conditions, each melting domain was investigated with at least one mutation or one polymorphism as reference. We tested 100 DNA samples harboring the C282Y, H63D, or S65C mutations and 17 artificially created positive controls that carried either 1 of the 14 other known HFE mutations or 3 selected polymorphisms. Investigations on each of the coding exons 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 could be performed at one analysis temperature. Coding exon 3 displayed a more complex melting profile and required two analysis temperatures. DHPLC detected all known HFE mutations as well as the three selected polymorphisms. DHPLC can be used to scan the HFE gene in HC probands in whom at least one chromosome lacks an assigned mutation.	11514397
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations, iron deficiency and overload in 10,500 blood donors.	British journal of haematology	2001	5.4	People with genetic haemochromatosis (GH) accumulate iron from excessive dietary absorption. In populations of northern European origin, over 90% of patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. While about 1 in 200 people in the general population have this genotype the proportion who develop clinical haemochromatosis is not known. The influence of HFE genotype on iron status was investigated in 10 556 blood donors. The allele frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations were 8.23% and 15.3% respectively. Heterozygosity for C282Y occurred in 1 in 7.9 donors, for H63D in 1 in 4.2 donors, and 1 in 42 were compound heterozygotes. Homozygosity for H63D occurred in 1 in 42 donors and 1 in 147 (72) were homozygous for C282Y. Mean values increased for transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin (sFn), and decreased for unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) in the order: donors lacking the mutations, H63D heterozygotes, C282Y heterozygotes, H63D homozygotes, compound heterozygotes and C282Y homozygotes, but serum ferritin (sFn) concentrations were no higher in H63D heterozygotes and C282Y heterozygous women than in donors lacking mutations. The percentage of donors failing the screening test for anaemia or of those with sFn < 15 microg/l did not differ among the genotype groups. C282Y and H63D heterozygotes and donors homozygous for H63D were at no greater risk of iron accumulation than donors lacking mutations, of whom 1 in 1200 had both a raised TS and sFn. The risk was higher for compound heterozygotes (1 in 80, P = 0.003) and for C282Y homozygotes (1 in 5, P < 0.0001). There was no correlation between sFn and either age or donation frequency in C282Y homozygotes. None of the 63 C282Y homozygous donors interviewed showed physical signs of overload or were aware of relatives with haemochromatosis. The Welsh Blood Service collects blood from about 140 000 people each year including an estimated 950 who are homozygous for HFE C282Y. They are probably healthy and unaware of any family history of iron overload.	11529872
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis mutations C282Y and H63D in 'cis' phase.	Clinical genetics	2001	3.89	Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene is a highly significant risk factor for the development of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and the majority of patients with HH have this genotype. An Irish/Belgian female with an elevated serum ferritin level and a family history of hemochromatosis was tested for the presence of the C282Y and H63D mutations. Results of digested PCR products have shown the patient to be homozygous for C282Y mutation and heterozygous for H63D mutation. Sequencing confirmed these findings. Genotyping of the patient's offspring and husband has also indicated the inheritance of both C282Y and H63D in 'cis'. Implications of this finding are: 1) the compound heterozygous state is by far the most common, but not the universal, phase for individuals found to be heterozygous for the two mutations, C282Y and H63D; 2) the C282Y and H63D mutations in the 'cis' phase may account for some cases of questionable parentage.	11531973
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association of HFE common mutations with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment in a Portuguese cohort.	BMC neurology	2006	1.96	Pathological brain iron deposition has been implicated as a source of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species in Alzheimer (AD) and Parkinson diseases (PD). Iron metabolism is associated with the gene hemochromatosis (HFE Human genome nomenclature committee ID:4886), and mutations in HFE are a cause of the iron mismetabolism disease, hemochromatosis. Several reports have tested the association of HFE variants with neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD and PD with conflicting results. Genotypes were analysed for the two most common variants of HFE in a series of 130 AD, 55 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 132 PD patients. Additionally, a series of 115 healthy age-matched controls was also screened. A statistically significant association was found in the PD group when compared to controls, showing that the presence of the C282Y variant allele may confer higher risk for developing the disease. Taken together these results suggest that the common variants in HFE may be a risk factor for PD, but not for AD in the Portuguese population.	16824219
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron overload and prolonged ingestion of iron supplements: clinical features and mutation analysis of hemochromatosis-associated genes in four cases.	American journal of hematology	2006	5.0	We evaluated and treated four white adults (one man, three women) who had iron overload associated with daily ingestion of iron supplements for 7, 15, 35, and 61 years, respectively. We performed HFE mutation analysis to detect C282Y, H63D, and S65C in each patient; in two patients, HFE exons were sequenced. In two patients, direct sequencing was performed to detect coding region mutations of TFR2, HAMP, FPN1, HJV, and ALAS2. Patients 1-4 ingested 153, 547, 1,341, and 4,898 g of inorganic iron as supplements. Patient 1 had hemochromatosis, HFE C282Y homozygosity, and beta-thalassemia minor. Patient 2 had spherocytosis and no HFE coding region mutations. Patient 3 had no anemia, a normal HFE genotype, and no coding region mutations in HAMP, FPN1, HJV, or ALAS2; she was heterozygous for the TFR2 coding region mutation V583I (nt 1,747 G-->A, exon 15). Patient 4 had no anemia and no coding region mutations in HFE, TFR2, HAMP, FPN1, HJV, or ALAS2. Iron removed by phlebotomy was 32.4, 10.4, 15.2, and 4.0 g, respectively. There was a positive correlation of log(10) serum ferritin and the quantity of iron removed by phlebotomy (P = 0.0371). Estimated absorption of iron from supplements in patients 1-4 was 20.9%, 1.9%, 1.1%, and 0.08%. We conclude that the clinical phenotypes and hemochromatosis genotypes of adults who develop iron overload after ingesting iron supplements over long periods are heterogeneous. Therapeutic phlebotomy is feasible and effective, and would prevent complications of iron overload.	16838333
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations and peripheral neuropathy during antiretroviral therapy.	AIDS (London, England)	2006	0.5	Peripheral neuropathy (PN) often complicates nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) therapy of HIV infection and may involve mitochondrial dysfunction. Since iron deficiency is associated with some types of PN, and iron is essential for mitochondrial function, we tested the hypothesis that hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations influence susceptibility to NRTI-induced PN. Case-control study involving multicenter, AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) protocol 384 and ACTG Human DNA Repository specimens. Study participants were randomized to receive three- or four-drug antiretroviral therapy with didanosine (ddI) plus stavudine (d4T) or zidovudine plus lamivudine, given with efavirenz, nelfinavir, or both, with up to three years of follow-up. PN was ascertained based on signs and symptoms. HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes were determined, and associations with PN were assessed using logistic regression. : Of 509 participants, 147 (29%) developed PN, 73% of whom had been randomized to receive ddI plus d4T. Among ddI/d4T-ever-treated individuals, HFE C282Y heterozygotes developed PN on ddI/d4T significantly less often than C282Y non-carriers, adjusting for age, CD4 lymphocyte count and viral load at baseline, and concomitant antiretroviral drugs [6% vs. 35%, respectively, in whites; adjusted odds ratio (OR), 0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03-0.83; P = 0.021]. Regardless of race/ethnicity, ddI/d4T-associated PN was uncommon in C282Y heterozygotes [race-adjusted OR, 0.30; 95% CI 0.09-0.96); P = 0.042]. Iron-loading HFE mutations such as C282Y are associated with a decreased risk of PN during antiretroviral therapy. This finding has potential implications for the prediction and prevention of NRTI-associated PN, particularly in populations at risk of iron deficiency.	16847405
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for hemochromatosis in asymptomatic subjects with or without a family history.	Archives of internal medicine	2006	0.5	Hemochromatosis in white subjects is mostly due to homozygosity for the common C282Y substitution in HFE. Although clinical symptoms are preventable by early detection of the genetic predisposition and prophylactic treatment, population screening is not currently advocated because of the discrepancy between the common mutation prevalence and apparently lower frequency of clinical disease. This study compared screening for hemochromatosis in subjects with or without a family history. We assessed disease expression by clinical evaluation and liver biopsy in 672 essentially asymptomatic C282Y homozygous subjects identified by either family screening or health checks. We also observed a subgroup of untreated homozygotes with normal serum ferritin levels for up to 24 years. Prevalence of hepatic iron overload and fibrosis were comparable between the 2 groups. Disease-related conditions were more common in male subjects identified by health checks, but they were older. Hepatic iron overload (grades 2-4) was present in 56% and 34.5% of male and female subjects, respectively; hepatic fibrosis (stages 2-4) in 18.4% and 5.4%; and cirrhosis in 5.6% and 1.9%. Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis correlated significantly with the hepatic iron concentration, and except in cases of cirrhosis, there was a 7.5-fold reduction in the mean fibrosis score after phlebotomy. All subjects with cirrhosis were asymptomatic. Screening for hemochromatosis in apparently healthy subjects homozygous for the C282Y mutation with or without a family history reveals comparable levels of hepatic iron overload and disease. Significant hepatic fibrosis is frequently found in asymptomatic subjects with hemochromatosis and, except when cirrhosis is present, is reversed by iron removal.	16476869
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	The p.T191M mutation of the CBS gene is highly prevalent among homocystinuric patients from Spain, Portugal and South America.	Journal of human genetics	2006	2.49	Classical homocystinuria is due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency. More than 130 mutations, which differ in prevalence and severity, have been described at the CBS gene. Mutation p.I278T is very prevalent, has been found in all European countries where it has been looked for with the exception of the Iberian peninsula, and is known to respond to vitamin B6. On the other hand, mutation p.T191M is prevalent in Spain and Portugal and does not respond to B6. We analysed 30 pedigrees from Spain, Portugal, Colombia and Argentina, segregating for homocystinuria. The p.T191M mutation was detected in patients from all four countries and was particularly prevalent in Colombia. The number of p.T191M alleles described in this study, together with those previously published, is 71. The prevalence of p.T191M among CBS mutant alleles in the different countries was: 0.75 in Colombia, 0.52 in Spain, 0.33 in Portugal, 0.25 in Venezuela, 0.20 in Argentina and 0.14 in Brazil. Haplotype analyses suggested a double origin for this mutation. No genotype-phenotype correlation other than the B6-nonresponsiveness could be established for the p.T191M mutation. Additionally, three new mutations, p.M173V, p.I429del and c.69_70+8del10, were found. The p.M173V was associated with a mild, B6-responsive, phenotype.	16479318
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Chronic inflammation does not appear to modify the homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis phenotype.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	The mechanism of excessive iron storage in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis caused by mutations of the HFE gene seems to be a failure to up-regulate hepcidin in the face of increased body iron. Since the cytokines IL-1 and IL-6 stimulate hepcidin transcription in the absence of HFE, chronic inflammatory states might counteract the effect of HFE mutations. We measured the pre-phlebotomy plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP) and of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in homozygotes for the C282Y mutation of HFE. There was no difference in these levels in subjects with high iron stores than in those with low iron stores, suggesting that the phenotypic differences between such homozygotes is not appreciably affected by ongoing chronic inflammation.	16154780
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Association of mutations of HFE gene and hepatocellular carcinoma following chronic hepatitis B].	Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology	2005	0.5	To investigate the frequency of HFE gene variants in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma following chronic hepatitis B and to analyze their relationships. 56 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma following chronic hepatitis B (HCC group) and 60 healthy blood donors (control group) were studied for the amino acid dimorphism at codon 63 (His63Asp=H63D) and codon 282 (Cys282Tyr = C282Y) of the HFE gene. The codon 63 and 282 dimorphisms were defined by PCR amplification of genomic DNA samples and restriction enzyme digestion using RsaI for C282Y and BclI for H63D. The association between hepatocellular carcinoma following chronic hepatitis B and HFE mutations were analyzed by Chi-square test. The genotype frequency of C2/C2 in the HCC group was markedly higher than that in the normal control group (10.7% vs 0) and there was a significant correlation between them. At the same time, the allele frequency of C2 in the HCC group was markedly higher than that in the normal control group (16.1% vs 1.7%) and there was a significant correlation between them also. The mutation of C282Y may be related with susceptibility to HCC after chronic hepatitis B. This outcome suggests that host HFE mutation may be an important factor related to the pathogenesis of HCC.	16174459
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron loading and morbidity among relatives of HFE C282Y homozygotes identified either by population genetic testing or presenting as patients.	Gut	2006	14.92	"""Although most cases of hereditary haemochromatosis are associated with homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, clinical penetrance varies and other genes may modify disease expression. If so, relatives from clinically affected families, by inheriting such genes, may accumulate more iron. To seek evidence for this, we compared iron status and morbidity in unselected first degree relatives of two groups of index cases from South Wales, namely asymptomatic C282Y homozygotes identified by genetic screening of blood donors (n = 56) and C282Y homozygous haemochromatosis patients presenting clinically (n = 60). All participating relatives had a structured interview, clinical assessment, and laboratory investigations. Health related quality of life was measured (SF-36 version 2). In total, 92% of 180 eligible first degree relatives were interviewed in the """"screened"""" family group and 85% of 143 eligible relatives in the """"patient"""" group. Of 59 relatives homozygous for C282Y, 76% of men and 32% of women had the """"iron phenotype"""" (raised transferrin saturation and serum ferritin). Logistic regression modelling of the iron phenotype risk showed that 42% of the initial model deviance could be explained by homozygosity for C282Y, another 6% by lifestyle factors, and 6% by being male. Family group membership was not a significant risk factor. Morbidity and SF-36 scores did not differ significantly either between C282Y homozygotes and relatives lacking C282Y, or between C282Y homozygotes from the """"screened"""" and """"patient"""" groups. Serious morbidity (including cirrhosis) was low in both groups of relatives. HFE C282Y homozygosity has a high penetrance for iron accumulation but a low clinical penetrance. Lack of excess morbidity among C282Y homozygous relatives of index cases who presented clinically suggests that residual unknown genetic or environmental factors do not greatly influence clinical outcome among C282Y homozygotes."""	16174659
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE-related hemochromatosis: an update for the rheumatologist.	Current rheumatology reports	2014	2.98	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a frequent disease in Caucasian populations. It leads to progressive iron overload in a variety of organs. The most common cause is the C282Y homozygous mutation in the HFE gene. The classical triad of skin hyperpigmentation, diabetes, and liver cirrhosis is nowadays rare but musculoskeletal symptoms are common in HFE-related hemochromatosis. Typically the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints, and the wrist, hip, and ankle joints are affected. Clinical symptoms include osteoarthritis-like symptoms, pseudogout attacks, and synovitis sometimes resembling rheumatoid arthritis. Radiographs show degenerative changes with joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and subchondral cysts. Chondrocalcinosis in the wrist and knee joints is seen in up to 50 % of patients. Although most other organ manifestations regress during phlebotomy, musculoskeletal symptoms often persist or even become worse. Importantly, patients are at an increased risk of severe large-joint arthritis necessitating joint replacement surgery. Therefore, future research should focus on the pathogenesis and treatment options for HH arthropathy.	24264720
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The functional significance of E277K and V295A HFE mutations.	British journal of haematology	2012	5.4	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive intestinal iron absorption resulting in increased pathological body iron stores. It is typically associated with homozygosity for the c.845G>A (p.C282Y) mutation in the HFE gene. However, other HFE alterations have been reported in affected individuals but their association with the disease is unclear. This study analysed the functional consequences of two HFE mutations, c.829G>A (p.E277K) and c.884T>C (p.V295A). Firstly, it was shown that c.829G>A affects the HFE splicing by diminishing the full length HFE and ivs4_66bp inclusion transcript levels, while increasing the amount of exon 4 skipping transcript. Immunofluorescent techniques showed that the HFE_E277K protein had a diffuse distribution (similar to HFE_C282Y) while HFE_V295A presented at the cell surface and perinuclear compartments (resembling HFE_wt). Immunoprecipitation assays revealed a decreased association of HFE_E277K and HFE_V295A with both β2-microglobulin (B2M; 38 ± 7% and 66 ± 8%, respectively) and transferrin receptor (TFRC, also termed TFR1) (58 ± 2% and 49 ± 16%, respectively). Herein, we prove that both mutations partially abrogate HFE association with B2M and TFRC, crucial for its correct processing and cell surface presentation. Although E277K has a more deleterious effect than V295A, we propose that both mutations may play a role in the development of hereditary haemochromatosis.	22624560
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Anti-obesity and pro-diabetic effects of hemochromatosis.	Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)	2014	0.5	Levels of tissue iron contribute to determining diabetes risk, but little is known about the effects of higher iron levels on weight, and on the interaction of weight and iron overload on diabetes risk. Therefore, the effect of iron on body mass index and diabetes in individuals with iron overload from hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), compared to non-HH siblings and historical controls was examined. Chart reviews were performed on a cohort of adults (age ≥40, N = 101) with the common C282Y/C282Y HFE genotype, compared to wild type siblings (N = 32) and comparable NHANES cohorts, with respect to body mass index and diabetes status. Males with HH have lower body mass index (BMI) than control siblings. Females had a trend toward decreased BMI that was not significant, possibly related to decreased degrees of iron overload. In both males and females, increased rates of diabetes were seen, especially in the overweight or obese. High tissue iron levels may be both pro- and anti-diabetic. The prevalence of obesity and diabetes in HH is likely dependent upon the degree of iron overload, caloric intake, and other genetic and environmental factors, contributing to the observed heterogeneity in the frequency of disease-related morbidities in HH.	25044717
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Diagnostic evaluation of hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE and non-HFE).	Hematology/oncology clinics of North America	2014	0.5	The management and understanding of hereditary hemochromatosis have evolved with recent advances in iron biology and the associated discovery of numerous genes involved in iron metabolism. HFE-related (type 1) hemochromatosis remains the most frequent form, characterized by C282Y mutation homozygosity. Rare forms of hereditary hemochromatosis include type 2 (A and B, juvenile hemochromatosis caused by HJV and HAMP mutation), type 3 (related to TFR2 mutation), and type 4 (A and B, ferroportin disease). The diagnostic evaluation relies on comprehension of the involved pathophysiologic defect, and careful characterization of the phenotype, which gives clues to guide appropriate genetic testing.	25064704
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The natural history of serum iron indices for HFE C282Y homozygosity associated with hereditary hemochromatosis.	Gastroenterology	2008	18.19	There are few longitudinal studies of serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) levels in individuals homozygous for the C282Y mutation. We characterized the development of elevated iron measures in C282Y homozygotes followed for 12 years. From 31,192 people aged 40-69 years at baseline, we identified 203 C282Y homozygotes (95 males), of whom 116 had SF and fasting TS levels measured at baseline (mean age, 55 years) and 86 were untreated and had iron measures at follow-up (mean, 12 years later). The probabilities of SF at follow-up exceeding clinical thresholds were predicted from baseline SF and TS under a multivariate normal model. For C282Y homozygotes, at baseline, 84% of males and 65% of females had elevated SF and 37% of males and 3% of females had SF >1000 microg/L. For males with SF 300-1000 microg/L at baseline, the predicted probability of progressing to SF >1000 microg/L at follow-up was between 13% and 35% and, for females, between 16% and 22%. For C282Y homozygotes with normal baseline SF, <15% were predicted to develop SF >1000 microg/L if left untreated. The majority of C282Y homozygotes who are likely to develop SF levels sufficient to place them at risk of iron overload-related disease will have done so by mean age 55 years. TS >95% at mean age 55 years in males increases the likelihood that SF levels will be elevated at mean age 65 years, but this effect is absent in females, most likely because of physiologic blood loss associated with menstruation.	18848943
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Porphyria cutanea tarda in Brazilian patients: association with hemochromatosis C282Y mutation and hepatitis C virus infection.	The American journal of gastroenterology	2000	0.5	Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is commonly associated with iron overload and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Association between hemochromatosis C282Y or H63D mutations and PCT has been observed, although not uniformly, and iron overload is also commonly found in chronic HCV hepatitis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of C282Y and H63D mutations and HCV infection in Brazilian patients with PCT and their relationship with iron overload. Twenty-three patients (19 men) aged 39.6 +/- 11.1 yr were studied. All had dermatological lesions of PCT and high levels of urinary uroporphyrin. HCV infection and iron overload were investigated. DNA samples were analyzed for the presence of HFE mutations. The frequency of C282Y was significantly higher in PCT patients than in 278 healthy individuals (17.4% vs 4%, odds ratio = 5.1, 95% confidence interval 1.5-17.6, p = 0.02), whereas no difference was observed regarding the H63D mutation (30.4% vs 31%, odds ratio = 1, 95% confidence interval 0.4-2.4, p = 1). Biochemical tests in PCT patients showed iron overload with transferrin saturation = 47.3 +/- 20.7% and ferritin = 566.8 +/- 425 ng/ml. Fifteen of 23 (65.2%) patients had HCV infection and alcohol ingestion was observed in 17 of 23 (73.9%). PCT patients exhibited evidence of iron overload, a high frequency of HCV, and an association with C282Y mutation. These data further support the notion that both acquired and inherited factors contribute to the occurrence of PCT, and indicate that screening for C282Y may be justified in PCT patients.	11151887
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effect of hemochromatosis genotype and lifestyle factors on iron and red cell indices in a community population.	Clinical chemistry	2001	7.46	Heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene may have altered hematology indices and higher iron stores than wild-type subjects. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 1488 females and 1522 males 20-79 years of age drawn from the Busselton (Australia) population study to assess the effects of HFE genotype, age, gender, and lifestyle on serum iron and hematology indices. Male C282Y heterozygotes had increased transferrin saturation compared with the wild-type genotype. Neither male nor female heterozygotes had significantly increased ferritin values compared with the wild-type genotype. Younger (20-29 years) wild-type males, but not heterozygous males, had significantly lower ferritin values than wild-type males in the older age groups. Compound heterozygous subjects had increased means for serum iron, transferrin saturation, corpuscular volume, and corpuscular hemoglobin compared with the wild-type genotype, and the males also had increased ferritin values (medians 323 vs 177 microg/L; P = 0.003). In both male and female wild-type subjects, an increased body mass index was associated with decreased serum iron and transferrin saturation and increased ferritin values. There was a significant increase in ferritin concentrations in both genders with increasing frequency of red meat consumption above a baseline of 1-2 times per week and alcohol intakes >10 g/day. Male C282Y heterozygotes had significantly increased transferrin saturation values. Compound heterozygous (C282Y/H63D) subjects formed a separate category of C282Y heterozygotes in whom both iron and red cell indices were significantly increased compared with the wild-type genotype.	11159767
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Could iron deposits in hepatocytes serve as a prognostic marker of HFE gene mutations?	Hepato-gastroenterology		0.79	The diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is based on qualitative measurement of tissue iron concentration and genetic tests. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the presence of iron deposits in the liver and the HFE gene mutations in patients with chronic liver diseases (CLD). The 182 patients, age range 18-71 years, were hospitalized in Gdansk because of CLD. The C282Y, H63D and S65C HFE mutations were screened by PCR-RFLP analysis. Liver function tests, serological examinations for viral hepatitis, serum iron and ferritin concentration and semiquantitative assessment of liver iron were done in all subjects. Patients were divided into Group A without iron deposits in the liver, and Group B with deposits. The most frequent etiology of CLD was chronic hepatitis C. Biochemical parameters indicating iron storage and ALT activity were significantly higher in Group B. Either typical for diagnosis HH homozygotes C282Y/C282Y and combined heterozygotes C282Y/H63D or carriers of other HFE gene mutations were found significantly more frequently in Group B. The finding of iron deposits in routinely obtained liver specimen correlates with occurrence of the different HFE gene mutations.	18705322
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	No evidence of increased risk of colorectal cancer in individuals heterozygous for the Cys282Tyr haemochromatosis mutation.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	1999	3.32	Previous studies have suggested that increased body iron stores and heterozygosity for haemochromatosis are associated with an increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. The aim of this study is to determine if there is an association between (i) colorectal carcinoma and heterozygosity for the Cys282Tyr mutation of the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) and (ii) this mutation and tumour site or stage. Two hundred and twenty-nine unselected patients (127 males, 102 females, mean age 68.0 years) with sporadic colorectal carcinoma and 228 controls (145 males, 83 females, mean age 69.7 years) were studied. DNA was tested for the presence of the Cys282Tyr mutation by digestion with Rsa1 and fragments separated by electrophoresis. Twenty-one patients with colorectal cancer and 23 control subjects were heterozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation of HFE (relative risk 0.90). There was no association between heterozygosity of the Cys282Tyr mutation and tumour site or stage. Heterozygosity for the Cys282Tyr mutation of HFE does not appear to be a risk factor for colorectal carcinoma.	10634155
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Peripheral blood erythrocyte parameters in hemochromatosis: evidence for increased erythrocyte hemoglobin content.	The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine	2000	0.5	We studied peripheral blood erythrocyte parameters and HFE genotypes in 94 hemochromatosis probands and 132 white, normal control subjects. Mean red blood cell counts in probands and control subjects were not significantly different. However, mean values of hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were significantly higher in C282Y/C282Y probands (n = 60) than in wild-type control subjects (n = 65). Probands with other HFE genotypes also had increased mean erythrocyte parameters (other than red blood cell count). Peripheral blood smears prepared before therapeutic phlebotomy revealed that erythrocytes in many probands had increased diameters and were well filled with hemoglobin. Erythrocyte parameters were similar in C282Y/C282Y probands with and without hepatomegaly, elevated serum concentrations of hepatic enzymes, hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, arthropathy, or hypogonadism. Among C282Y/C282Y probands, significantly greater values of MCV (but not other erythrocyte parameters) occurred among those who had transferrin saturation values of 75% or greater or iron overload at diagnosis. After iron depletion, the mean MCV, MCH, and MCHC values of C282Y/C282Y probands decreased but remained significantly greater than values in wild-type control subjects. Mean values of prephlebotomy MCH and MCHC concentrations were lower in HLA-A3-positive than in HLA-A3-negative C282Y/C282Y probands. We conclude that increased values of mean hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, and MCHC in hemochromatosis probands are caused primarily by increased iron uptake and hemoglobin synthesis by immature erythroid cells. Mechanisms of iron uptake by erythrocytes that could explain these results are discussed.	10638700
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron overload in cirrhosis-HFE genotypes and outcome after liver transplantation.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2000	0.5	Previously, we found appreciable hepatic iron deposition in one third of our patients undergoing liver transplantation (LTx) with approximately 10% of cases having quantifiable iron in the range of that seen in hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcome in liver transplant patients with and without iron overload. We also sought to determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in liver transplant patients with iron overload. Of 456 consecutive liver transplants, 41 explants had an hepatic iron index (HII) greater than 1.9, and these cases were compared to 41 matched liver transplant recipients without increased hepatic iron. Posttransplantation complications, along with patient and graft survival were monitored. HFE gene testing was performed using DNA-based techniques. Kaplan-Meier 5-year patient survival after LTx was significantly lower in cases with hepatic iron overload compared to matched controls without iron excess (48% vs. 77%; P =.045). Fatal infections (especially fungal) were more common in patients with iron overload (24% vs. 7%; P =.03). Of the 41 patients with a liver explant HII greater than 1.9, only 4 were C282Y homozygotes. Patients with severe hepatic explant iron overload undergoing LTx have a reduced survival compared to liver transplant recipients without explant iron excess. The reduced survival was attributable mainly to fatal bacterial and fungal infections. Despite the iron overload, HFE gene mutations were uncommon in patients with hepatic explant hemosiderosis.	10655270
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Compound heterozygous hemochromatosis genotype predicts increased iron and erythrocyte indices in women.	Clinical chemistry	2000	7.46	Women who inherit heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene may have increased serum iron indices and hemoglobin and are less likely to develop iron deficiency compared with women with the wild-type genotype. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 497 women 20-44 years of age and 830 women >51 years of age drawn from the Busselton (Australia) population study to assess the effects of the HFE genotype on serum iron and hematology indices. Heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation occurred in 13.8% of the study population, comprising 11.8% C282Y wild-type heterozygotes and 2.0% C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes. In the younger age group, C282Y wild-type women did not have significantly increased serum iron, transferrin saturation, or hemoglobin values, and were not protected from developing iron deficiency, compared with women of the same age with the wild-type genotype. Young compound heterozygous women had higher means for serum iron (25.0 vs 16.9 micromol/L; P <0.001), transferrin saturation (42.0% vs 25.6%; P <0. 05), hemoglobin (139.4 vs 132.3 g/L; P <0.05), and corpuscular volume (91.1 vs 87.7 fL; P <0.05), and a higher median ferritin (53 vs 44 microg/L; P <0.05) compared with the wild-type genotype. Similar results were observed for compound heterozygotes in the >51 years age group. Women with the compound heterozygous HFE genotype C282Y/H63D, but not the C282Y wild-type genotype, had increased values for serum iron and transferrin saturation, and the younger age group also had increased hemoglobin values. We conclude that the compound heterozygous genotype may have a beneficial effect in protecting women from iron deficiency.	10657371
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutation analysis of the HFE gene in Brazilian populations.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	We analyzed the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene in 227 individuals from Brazil comprising 71 Caucasians, 91 racially mixed Caucasian African-derived Amerindians (both populations from Southeast Brazil), 85 African-derived subjects (from Northeast Brazil) and 75 Parakanã Indians. Allelic frequency of the mutation C. 845G(A (C282Y) was 1.4% in the Caucasian population, 1.1% in the African-derived population, 1.1% in the racially mixed normal controls and 0% in the Parakanã Indians. In the African-derived population, the C282Y mutation was present on chromosomes bearing the haplotype 6/1h according to Beutler and West (1997). Allelic frequency of the mutation C. 187C(G (H63D) was 16.3% in the Caucasian population, 7.5% in the African-derived population, 9.8% in the racially mixed controls and 0% in the Amerindians. The presence of these mutations in the African-derived population reflects the fact that these subjects may have undergone a non-identified racial admixture in their past history. The absence of both defects in the Amerindians suggests that these mutations have emerged after the migration of Polynesians to America, or that they may not have reached the Polynesian population until after the migration to America had occurred.	10660479
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations of the HFE gene and the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	The discovery of the C282Y and H63D point mutations in the hereditary hemochromatosis-associated HFE gene allows us to study the molecular basis of congenital and acquired iron overload disorders. In hereditary hemochromatosis an increased frequency of the C282Y and, to a lesser extent, of the H63D mutations has been established, but their role in other conditions associated with iron overload and their prevalence in the normal population are still under investigation. We sought to determine the presence of such mutations, and their possible involvement in the multi-step neoplastic transformation of the hepatocytes, in patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, a frequent complication of iron-induced liver cirrhosis occurring in untreated hereditary hemochromatosis subjects. The frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations was determined in DNA from 12 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and with no clinical signs of hereditary hemochromatosis. The frequency of the mutations was also determined in 130 normal subjects. A germline C282Y mutation was found in none of the hepatocellular carcinoma patients; the frequency of the H63D mutation was not increased, compared to the 130 controls. The allele frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the normal population were 0.042 and 0.185, respectively. In conclusion, we suggest that the hereditary hemochromatosis-related mutations of the HFE gene do not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma.	10660482
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE S65C variant is not associated with increased transferrin saturation in voluntary blood donors.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Two amino acid variants in the HFE gene, C282Y and H63D, have been reported in most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis. A recently discovered novel amino acid variant of HFE, namely S65C, has been implicated to be responsible for a mild form of iron overload. We determined genotypes of the HFE S65C variant in 230 voluntary blood donors with a transferrin saturation >45%, who did not carry the HFE C282Y variant. The control group consisted of 248 first time blood donors who had a transferrin saturation < 45%. We also determined genotypes of the HFE H63D variant in the two groups. For the HFE S65C variant, the frequency of the HFE C65 allele was 1. 7% and 2.2% in the high and low transferrin saturation groups, respectively (p = 0.65). In contrast, for the HFE H63D variant, the frequency of the HFE D63 allele was 24.8% and 14.7% in the high and low transferrin saturation groups, respectively (p = 0.0009). This study demonstrates no association of the HFE C65 allele with the phenotype of high transferrin saturation. The results do not support the use of DNA genotyping for the HFE S65C mutation in population screening studies for hemochromatosis.	10660483
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genotypic/phenotypic correlations in genetic hemochromatosis: evolution of diagnostic criteria.	Gastroenterology	1998	18.19	The identification of a candidate gene for hereditary hemochromatosis in 69%-100% of patients with hemochromatosis has resulted in a diagnostic genotypic test (C282Y). The aim of this study was to reassess the phenotypic diagnostic criteria for hemochromatosis in patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. Transferrin saturation, ferritin, hepatic iron index, and iron removed by venesection were studied in C282Y++ homozygotes and C282Y-- putative homozygotes. Patients were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in 122 of 128 cases (95%). In C282Y homozygotes, the results were as follows: hepatic iron index, >1.9 in 91.3%; transferrin saturation, >55% in 90%; serum ferritin, >300 microg/L in 96% of men and >200 microg/L in 97% of women; and iron removed, >5 g in 70% of men and 73% of women. There were four homozygotes for C282Y with no biochemical evidence of iron overload. The sensitivity of the phenotypic tests in decreasing order was as follows: serum ferritin, hepatic iron index, transferrin saturation, and iron removed by venesection. Although the genetic test is useful in the diagnostic algorithm, this study has shown both iron-loaded patients without the mutation and homozygous patients without iron overload.	9453492
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A simple genetic test identifies 90% of UK patients with haemochromatosis. The UK Haemochromatosis Consortium.	Gut	1997	14.92	The diagnosis of genetic haemochromatosis (GH) before iron overload has developed is difficult. However a convincing candidate gene for GH, HFE (previously HLA-H), has been described recently. To determine the prevalence of the haemochromatosis associated HFE mutations C282Y and H63D in United Kingdom affected and control populations. The prevalence of the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations was determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction enzyme digestion in a cohort of 115 well characterised patients with GH and 101 controls from the United Kingdom. One hundred and five of 115 (91%) patients with GH were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Only one of 101 (1%) controls was homozygous for the C282Y mutation and this individual currently shows evidence of iron overload. Two of five patients who did not have either of the two described mutations of HFE had early onset iron overload (ages 16 and 24). One had a family history of cardiac failure and the second was subsequently hospitalised due to cardiac failure. These are the first phenotypic observations for patients without either C282Y or H63D mutation of HFE. This simple genetic test promises to be a highly effective tool in the diagnosis of GH.	9462220
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The hemochromatosis gene product complexes with the transferrin receptor and lowers its affinity for ligand binding.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	1998	9.42	We recently reported the positional cloning of a candidate gene for hereditary hemochromatosis called HFE. The gene product, a member of the major histocompatibility complex class I-like family, was found to have a mutation, Cys-282 --> Tyr (C282Y), in 85% of patient chromosomes. This mutation eliminates the ability of HFE to associate with beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) and prevents cell-surface expression. A second mutation that has no effect on beta2m association, H63D, was found in eight out of nine patients heterozygous for the C282Y mutant. In this report, we demonstrate in cultured 293 cells overexpressing wild-type or mutant HFE proteins that both the wild-type and H63D HFE proteins form stable complexes with the transferrin receptor (TfR). The C282Y mutation nearly completely prevents the association of the mutant HFE protein with the TfR. Studies on cell-associated transferrin at 37 degrees C suggest that the overexpressed wild-type HFE protein decreases the affinity of the TfR for transferrin. The overexpressed H63D protein does not have this effect, providing the first direct evidence for a functional consequence of the H63D mutation. Addition of soluble wild-type HFE/beta2m heterodimers to cultured cells also decreased the apparent affinity of the TfR for its ligand under steady-state conditions, both in 293 cells and in HeLa cells. Furthermore, at 4 degrees C, the added soluble complex of HFE/beta2m inhibited binding of transferrin to HeLa cell TfR in a concentration-dependent manner. Scatchard plots of these data indicate that the added heterodimer substantially reduced the affinity of TfR for transferrin. These results establish a molecular link between HFE and a key protein involved in iron transport, the TfR, and raise the possibility that alterations in this regulatory mechanism may play a role in the pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis.	9465039
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A 6-year survey of HFE gene test for hemochromatosis diagnosis.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics	2005	7.71	A 6-year survey of HFE gene test was conducted to evaluate its helpfulness for hereditary hemochromatosis diagnosis. We analyzed C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations on 3525 individuals. The test produced 89.7% and 30% of positive results for individuals clinically diagnosed hemochromatosis before HFE gene-test availability and those prospectively tested because of elevated serum iron parameter and/or family history, respectively; among them there were 90.4% and 48.7% of C282Y homozygotes. The HFE gene test confirmed a genetic defect that may lead to iron loading in individuals when iron parameter values, especially for the C282Y/C282Y, were still low as well as for genotypes usually associated with low expressivity and penetrance (C282Y/H63D, H63D/H63D). This gene-test should allow a biochemical follow-up of patients carrying a disease-related genotype.	15654232
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene mutations and distal adenomatous colorectal polyps.	Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology	2005	3.62	Iron has been suggested to be a risk factor for colorectal neoplasia. Some individuals who are heterozygous for mutations in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) have higher than average serologic measures of iron. We therefore investigated whether heterozygosity for HFE mutations was related to risk of advanced distal adenoma and whether the relationship was affected by dietary iron intake. In the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, 679 persons with advanced distal adenoma and 697 control persons were genotyped for the two major HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D), one HFE polymorphism (IVS2+4), and one polymorphism (G142S) in the transferrin receptor gene (TFRC). HFE haplotypes were also created to examine the effect of haplotype on risk. Food frequency questionnaire data were used to estimate daily iron intake. There was no relationship between any HFE genotype or haplotype and advanced adenoma. Stratification of HFE genotype by TFRC genotype did not change the results. In addition, there was no relationship between dietary iron intake and risk of adenoma or between HFE genotype and risk of adenoma, stratified by iron intake. These results do not support a relationship between HFE heterozygosity and risk of advanced distal adenoma.	15668490
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Redox active plasma iron in C282Y/C282Y hemochromatosis.	Blood	2005	11.84	Labile plasma iron (LPI) represents the redox active component of non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI). Its presence in thalassemic patients has been recently reported. The aim of the present study was to quantify LPI in HFE genetic hemochromatosis (GH) and to characterize the mechanisms accounting for its appearance. We studied 159 subjects subdivided into the following groups: (1) 23 with iron overloaded GH; (2) 14 with iron-depleted GH; (3) 26 with dysmetabolic hepatosiderosis; (4) 33 with alcoholic cirrhosis; (5) 63 healthy controls. Both NTBI and LPI were substantially higher in patients with iron-overloaded GH than in those with iron-depleted GH or in healthy controls. LPI was significantly correlated with serum transaminase increase in this group. LPI was elevated in the alcoholic cirrhosis subgroup of severely affected patients. LPI was found essentially when transferrin saturation exceeded 75%, regardless of the etiologic condition. Transferrin saturation above 75% was related to iron overload in GH and to liver failure in alcoholic cirrhosis. LPI is present in C282Y/C282Y hemochromatosis and may be a marker of toxicity due to its potential for catalyzing the generation of reactive oxygen radicals in vivo.	15671444
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron overload in kidney transplants: prospective analysis of biochemical and genetic markers.	Kidney international	2005	7.68	The prevalence of iron overload and the influence of mutations in the HFE and TRF2 gene on biochemical markers of iron overload among renal transplant patients is unknown. Serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and liver function parameters were analyzed in a cohort of 438 renal transplants. In patients with iron overload, the time course of biochemical markers of iron status as well as the influence of iron loading mutations was investigated during a time period of 5 years. Of 438 renal transplant patients 41 (9.4%) presented with an iron loading phenotype (TSAT above 40% and/or ferritin above 800 ng/mL). Mutations in the HFE gene were present in 12 of 33 (36.3%) patients with iron overload. Among these one patient was homozygous for HFE C282Y, and two patients were compound heterozygous for HFE C282Y/H63D. No individual tested positive for nine other mutations in HFE as well as theTRF2 Y250X mutation. Over time we observed a decrease of mean iron and ferritin levels, and of mean TSAT in our study sample. In patients with mutations in HFE this decrease was less pronounced as compared to patients without mutations. We found an independent positive association between the presence of mutations in HFE and serum alanine-aminotransferase levels at follow-up (P= 0.003). Our study demonstrates that iron overload is frequently present in renal transplant patients and shows a continuous decrease over time. This decrease is possibly impaired by the HFE C282Y and HFE H63D mutations. Furthermore, mutations in HFE may influence liver function as reflected by increased alanine-aminotransferase concentrations.	15673318
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Improved detection of hereditary haemochromatosis.	Journal of clinical pathology	2015	2.91	There is high prevalence of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) in North European populations, yet the diagnosis is often delayed or missed in primary care. Primary care physicians frequently request serum ferritin (SF) estimation but appear uncertain as how to investigate patients with raised SF values. Our aim was to develop a laboratory algorithm with high predictive value for the diagnosis of HH in patients from primary care with raised SF values. Transferrin saturation (Tsat) was measured on SF samples sent from primary care; 1657 male and 2077 female patients age ≥ 30 years with SF ≥ 200 μg/L. HFE genotyping was performed on all 878 male and 867 female patients with Tsat >30%. This study identified 402 (206 men; 196 women) C282Y carriers and 132 (58 men; 74 women) C282Y homozygotes. Optimal limits for combined SF and Tsat values for HH recognition were established. The detection rate for homozygous C282Y HH for male patients with both SF ≥ 300 μg/L and Tsat >50% was 18.8% (52/272) and 16.3% (68/415) for female patients with both SF ≥ 200 μg/L and Tsat >40%. The large number of SF requests received from primary care should be used as a resource to improve the diagnosis of HH in areas of high prevalence.	25540266
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A novel HFE mutation (c.del478) results in nonsense-mediated decay of the mutant transcript in a hemochromatosis patient.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	On admission to hospital Caucasian 61 year old male with jaundice was found to have unexplained increased serum iron indices. He had bilateral peripheral arthritis. On further investigation he had grade II hepatocellular iron staining and a hepatic index of 5.4 leading to a diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. He lacked the common C282Y HFE mutation. We sequenced the complete HFE gene and found that he was heterozygous for a novel single nucleotide deletion (c.del478) in exon 3 of HFE. He lacks any other mutation in HFE or HJV, TFR2, HAMP and SLC40A1. The HFE mutation causes a frameshift (p.P160fs) that introduces a premature termination codon leading to mRNA degradation by nonsense-mediated decay. Haploinsufficiency of HFE may be one possible explanation for hemochromatosis in this patient.	19477142
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Individuals homozygous for the H63D mutation have significantly elevated iron indexes.	Digestive diseases and sciences	2006	2.52	Our objective was to assess the iron indexes of patients with one or more mutations of the HFE gene with a specific interest in studying the effect of the H63D/H63D genotype. Eight hundred twenty subjects who underwent HFE mutational testing for C282Y and H63D mutations were retrospectively identified. Data collected included age, gender, HFE genotype, and values for serum ferritin, iron saturation, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Compared to the Wild/Wild genotype (0.34 +/- 0.17), genotypes H63D/C282Y (0.44 +/- 0.14 P < 0.01), H63D/H63D (0.51 +/- 0.21 P < 0.01), and C282Y/C282Y (0.64 +/- 0.20 P < 0.01) had significantly higher transferrin saturation levels and were independent predictors of higher iron saturation in multivariate regression analysis. Compared to the Wild/Wild genotype, no abnormal HFE genotypes had significantly higher ferritin levels, although the genotype H63D/H63D was an independent predictor of higher serum ferritin (P = 0.02) in regression analysis. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with abnormally elevated AST (P = 0.64) or ALT (P = 0.80) between groups. H63D homozygotes have elevated transferrin saturation compared to the Wild genotype, comparable to that of C282Y homozygotes and compound heterozygotes. The clinical significance of this finding is unclear but warrants further study.	16615007
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The celtic coincidence--the frequency and clinical characterisation of hereditary haemochromatosis in patients with coeliac disease.	Irish journal of medical science		1.16	Hereditary Haemochromatosis (HH) and Coeliac disease (CD) are common disorders in Northern European populations, particularly the Irish population. To investigate whether there was increased frequency of the two common HFE gene mutations, C282Y and H63D, associated with HH amongst a cohort of CD patients, and to determine the penetrance of the HH associated genotypes in this cohort. HFE genotypes of a cohort of CD patients were determined using standard PCR techniques. HFE allele frequencies were compared to those of a previously reported, ethnically similar, cohort of 800 neonates, using Fishers exact test. Patients with HH-associated genotypes were subsequently evaluated. The C282Y and H63D allele frequencies, 24/222 (11%) and 28/222 (13%) respectively, in the CD patients were similar to those of the neonatal group, 171/1600 (11%) and 242/1600 (15%). Eight patients had HH-associated genotypes, of which two demonstrated biochemical evidence of iron overload. The HFE mutations associated with Hereditary Haemochromatosis are not more common in Irish CD patients.	16615226
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Contrasting behaviors of mutant cystathionine beta-synthase enzymes associated with pyridoxine response.	Human mutation	2006	5.09	Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a recessive genetic disorder characterized by extremely elevated levels in plasma homocysteine. Patients homozygous for the I278T or R266K mutations respond clinically to pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine, the precursor of a cofactor for the enzyme, 5'-pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). Here we test the hypothesis that these mutations are pyridoxine responsive because they lower the affinity of the enzyme for PLP. We show that recombinant R266K has 30 to 100% of the specific activity of the wild-type enzyme, while I278T only has only 1 to 5% activity. Kinetic studies show that the decreased activity in both enzymes is due to reduced turnover rate and not substrate binding. Neither I278T nor R266K appear to greatly affect multimer status of the enzyme. The R266K enzyme has reduced affinity for PLP compared to the wild-type enzyme, providing a mechanism for the pyridoxine response observed in patients. Surprisingly, the I278T enzyme does not have altered affinity for PLP. To confirm that this was not an in vitro artifact, we examined pyridoxine response in mice that stably express human I278T as their sole source of CBS activity. These mice have extremely elevated plasma homocysteine levels and do not respond significantly to large doses of pyridoxine. Our findings suggest that there may be multiple mechanisms involved in response to pyridoxine.	16619244
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis-associated gene mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts.	American journal of hematology	2007	5.0	We observed increased ferritin levels in newly diagnosed MDS-RARS patients without transfusional iron-overload. Hence, we hypothesized RARS patients may harbor hemochromatosis-related mutations, which could contribute to the pathophysiology of this myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) subset. We studied a cohort of 140 MDS patients: 42 with RARS, 10 with increased ringed sideroblasts, and 96 with other forms of MDS (43 RA, 27 RAEB, 17 RAEB-T, 8 MDS/MPD, 1 CMML). Patients were genotyped using restriction fragment length polymorphism, designed to detect C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. We found significantly higher frequency of heterozygosity for C282Y mutation in RARS patients compared with a large control population of matched race individuals (21 vs. 9.8% in controls, P = 0.03); H63D genotype was not significantly increased. Frequency of HFE variation in other MDS subtypes failed to differ significantly from controls. Within this group, we included patients with a rare form of MDS, provisionally subclassified by WHO as RARS with thrombocytosis (RARSt). 10/14 RARSt patients were carriers of either C282Y or H63D allele significantly increased compared with the combined prevalence in a healthy population (71 vs. 33%, P < 0.01). We found expected distribution of mutant HFE alleles in patients with other forms of MDS (9.1 vs. 9.8%, P = 0.82). Increased prevalence of HFE gene mutations is not a generalized feature of MDS, but some subgroups of MDS, especially those characterized by excessive accumulation of ringed sideroblasts, exhibit C282Y mutations at a higher frequency than in other forms of MDS and healthy controls.	17654685

To investigate the allele frequency of HFE mutations and the associations between mutations and cases of iron overload or liver diseases in an open population of Central Italy. A total of 502 individuals over 8 years of age, comprising 203 males and 299 females, who were residents in Arsita (a small town in Central Italy), were assayed for: C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations of the HFE gene by TaqMan probes; body mass index, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, transaminases, GGT, glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, HBV and HCV serum markers. Information was obtained on alcohol intake. Liver ultrasound was performed in 334 (67%) subjects. The allele frequencies for C282Y, H63D and S65C were 2%, 15%, and 0.01%, respectively. C282Y/wt was found in 19 subjects (4%), H63D/wt in 127 (25%), H63D/H63D in 11 (2%) and S65C/wt in one (2.0 per thousand). No homozygosity for C282Y or compound mutation (C282Y/H63D) was found in the study population, but 27 subjects (5%) had TfSat >45% (including 10 subjects with high serum ferritin). Overall, 49 subjects (9.8%) were HCV-RNA-positive. Logistic regression analysis indicated that male gender (P = 0.000) and hepatic steatosis (P = 0.017) were independent variables correlating to a high serum ferritin. C282Y HFE mutation is less frequent in Central Italy than in Northern Italy.	17661761
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D and S65C) mutations in a general Chinese Han population.	Tissue antigens	2007	2.05	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is one of the most common autosomal recessive genetic disorders of iron metabolism in white populations, which leads to inappropriately high iron absorption. C282Y, H63D, and S65C are three major missense mutations of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE). In the present study, C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations in 395 normal Chinese Han populations from Zhejiang province were investigated. No C282Y, S65C mutations, and H63D homozygote was observed, while the genotype frequency of H63D heterozygote was 4.6% and the allelic frequency 2.3% in this population. This was the first report to analyze the prevalence of C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations in the HFE gene in a Chinese Han population. Low incidence of the HFE gene mutations could be a reason for the rarity of HH in the Chinese Han population studied.	17661915
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotypes in patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics	2007	7.71	The homozygous p.C282Y variant of the HFE gene is a major risk factor for hereditary hemochromatosis, a disorder of iron metabolism resulting in progressive iron accumulation in a variety of organs including the pancreas. Heterozygosity of p.C282Y and p.H63D may increase susceptibility to chronic liver and pancreatic disease. This study determines the frequencies of p.C282Y and p.H63D alterations in patients with chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In total, 958 patients (349 with alcoholic pancreatitis, 343 with idiopathic pancreatitis, 64 with familial chronic pancreatitis, 34 with acute pancreatitis, and 168 with pancreatic adenocarcinoma) were enrolled and compared with 681 healthy and 100 alcoholic controls. Furthermore, 45 parent-offspring trios were included for segregation analysis. Genotyping of p.C282Y and p.H63D was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism or melting curve analyses. No significant differences were found in heterozygosity for p.C282Y and p.H63D when patients with alcoholic (8.0/21.5%), idiopathic (7.3/24.5%), or familial (9.8/23.0%) pancreatitis, or pancreatic adenocarcinoma (5.4/28.6%) were compared with healthy (6.2/24.8%) and alcoholic (7.0/25.0%) controls. Neither genotype was associated with the presence of secondary diabetes mellitus in patients with chronic pancreatitis. Although hemochromatosis is associated with pancreatic pathology, the p.C282Y and p.H63D variants do not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	17666895
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	African Americans at risk for increased iron stores or liver disease.	The American journal of medicine	2007	0.5	We sought to determine the prevalence of elevated measures of iron status in African Americans and whether the combination of serum ferritin concentration >200 microg/L for women or >300 microg/L for men and transferrin saturation in the highest quartile represents increased likelihood of mutation of HFE, self-reported iron overload or self-reported liver disease. A cross-sectional observational study of 27,224 African Americans > or =25 years of age recruited in a primary care setting was conducted as part of the multi-center, multi-ethnic Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study. Measurements included serum ferritin concentration, transferrin saturation, testing for HFE C282Y and H63D, and self-reported iron overload and liver disease. Serum ferritin concentration >200 microg/L for women or >300 microg/L for men occurred in 5263 (19.3%) of African Americans, while serum ferritin concentration in this range with highest-quartile transferrin saturation (>29% women; >35% men) occurred in 1837 (6.7%). Adjusted odds of HFE mutation (1.76 women, 1.67 men), self-reported iron overload (1.97 women, 2.88 men), or self-reported liver disease (5.18 women, 3.73 men) were greater with elevated serum ferritin concentration and highest-quartile transferrin saturation than with nonelevated serum ferritin concentration (each P <.05). Serum ferritin concentration >200 microg/L for women or >300 microg/L for men in combination with transferrin saturation >29% for women or >35% for men occurs in approximately 7% of adult African American primary care patients. Patients with this combination of iron test results should be evaluated for increased body iron stores or liver disease.	17679134
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE C282Y mutations are associated with advanced hepatic fibrosis in Caucasians with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2007	0.5	Previous studies examining the relationship between HFE mutations and severity of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) have been limited by small sample size or ascertainment bias. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between HFE mutations and histological severity in a large North American multicenter cohort with NASH. Data from 126 NASH patients were collected from 6 North American centers. Liver biopsy and genotyping for the C282Y and H63D HFE mutations were performed in all subjects. Serum transferrin-iron saturation and ferritin levels as well as hepatic iron content were recorded whenever available. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with advanced hepatic fibrosis. The prevalence of heterozygous C282Y and H63D HFE mutations was 14.3% and 21.4%, respectively, in the overall cohort. Among Caucasians, C282Y heterozygotes were more likely to have bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis (44% versus 21% [P = 0.05]) and stainable hepatic iron (50% versus 16% [P = 0.011]) compared with patients with other genotypes. Diabetes mellitus was the only independent predictor of advanced hepatic fibrosis (OR 4.37, 95% CI 1.41-13.54 [P = 0.010]) using multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, and HFE genotype status. The HFE C282Y heterozygous mutation is associated with advanced fibrosis among Caucasians with NASH. Additional studies are warranted to examine the possible mechanisms for this relationship.	17680648
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Porphyria cutanea tarda with sclerodermatous changes and hemochromatosis].	Der Hautarzt; Zeitschrift fur Dermatologie, Venerologie, und verwandte Gebiete	2014	0.5	A 55-year-old woman presented with blistering on the back of her hands and shiny, thickened skin in her décolletage. Laboratory examination revealed increased urinary total and high carboxylated porphyrins and homozygosity for mutation C282Y in the HFE gene. Histopathology showed thickened collagen fibers in the presternal region. Based on these findings we made the diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda with pseudoscleroderma and hemochromatosis. Pseudoscleroderma is a rare complication of PCT but can also constitute the first cutaneous symptom of the disease, leading the way to diagnosis. Usually, adequate treatment of PCT with normalization of porphyrin values also results in improvement of pseudoscleroderma.	24718503
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[The prevalence of the Cys282Tyr mutation in the hemochromatosis gene in Cantabria in patients diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis].	Medicina clinica	1999	1.27	The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of Cys282Tyr mutation in patients with genetic haemochromatosis (GH) in Cantabria. The HFE Cys282Tyr mutation was determined in a cohort of 60 patients with GH and 213 controls. The frequency of the Cys282Tyr mutation in control individuals was 4.4%. Sixty-seven percent of patients with GH were homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation. Twenty-seven percent of patients were normal at Cys282Tyr loci. The prevalence of the Cys282Tyr mutation in patients with GH in Cantabria, Spain, seems to be lower than in North America and in North Europe patients.	10320958
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A Chinese patient with non-HFE-linked iron overload.	Journal of clinical gastroenterology	2001	3.16	The gene for hemochromatosis (HFE) was recently identified and contains two missense mutations: C282Y and H63D. The C282Y mutation is found homozygous in approximately 85% to 90% of patients of Northern European ancestry with hereditary hemochromatosis. There are no previous reports with results of genetic testing in Chinese patients with regard to iron overload. In this case report, we describe a Chinese woman with marked hepatic iron overload that was nonfamilial, with unusual biopsy findings, in whom neither the C282Y nor the H63D mutations in HFE were found.	11418796
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Heterozygosity for the H63D mutation in the hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE) gene may lead into severe iron overload in beta-thalassemia minor: observations in a thalassemic kindred.	Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion		0.5	Heterozygosity for beta-thalassemia (minor) by itself does not lead into iron overload; however, when it is inherited together with a homozygous state for either the H63D or the C282Y mutations of the hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE gene), iron overload may ensue. We describe here a kindred in which the propositus, being heterozygote for beta-thalassemia and the H63D mutation of the HFE gene, developed severe iron overload and in turn, chronic liver failure with portal hypertension. Other members of the family with either beta-thalassemia or heterozygous for the H63D gene mutation did not develop iron overload. The interaction between beta-thalassemia and hereditary hemochromatosis is briefly discussed and speculations about other possible genetic mutations leading into familial iron loading are done.	11421105
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Role of hemochromatosis C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE gene in development of type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy.	Diabetes care	2001	8.93	In patients with clinical hemochromatosis, the frequency of diabetes ranges from 20 to 50%, and the heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene might be associated with an increased risk for diabetes. There are also some reports that suggest that iron overload might cause diabetic nephropathy. We performed an association study to assess the role of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Altogether, 563 patients with type 2 diabetes were included in the study. In the analyzed group, 108 patients had overt proteinuria, 154 had microalbuminuria, and 301 had normoalbuminuria. Among the patients with normoalbuminuria, only those with known diabetes duration > or = 10 years were considered normoalbuminuric (n = 162). A total of 196 unrelated healthy subjects were used as a control group. All subjects were genotyped for C282Y and H63D using the polymerase chain reaction-based protocol. There was an increased frequency of 282Y allele carriers among patients with type 2 diabetes versus healthy control subjects (OR 5.3, 95% CI 1.6-17.3). We observed an increased frequency of the 63D allele carriers among patients with diabetic nephropathy (1.8, 1.2-2.8). In conclusion, our study is the first to indicate that being a carrier of the H63D hemochromatosis mutation is a risk factor for nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. We also confirmed previous observations that the frequency of the 282Y mutation was higher in patients with type 2 diabetes than it was in the general population of healthy subjects.	11423500
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis since discovery of the HFE gene.	Clinical chemistry	2001	7.46	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism that is characterized by excessive iron deposition in major organs of the body. Chronic increased iron absorption leads to multiorgan dysfunction. Since the discovery of the gene responsible for the majority of cases, research has progressed rapidly to identify the gene product, the effects of mutations, and the implications for different populations. The protein product of the HFE gene is a transmembrane glycoprotein, termed HFE, that modulates iron uptake. Mutations in the HFE protein compromise its function and produce disease symptoms. Two mutations, C282Y and H63D, have been linked to the majority of disease cases. We reviewed the recent literature for the molecular basis of hereditary hemochromatosis. Genotypic information was combined with biochemical and clinical phenotypic information to achieve a better understanding of the disease mechanism. This review provides a comprehensive discussion of known mutations in the HFE gene and their phenotypic expression. Diagnostic criteria using molecular genetic techniques in conjunction with traditional biochemical tests are provided. Current methods and limitations of molecular testing are examined in detail. A strategy for population screening and an algorithm for diagnosis that incorporates molecular testing are presented. Treatment by therapeutic phlebotomy and the use of blood obtained from hemochromatosis patients are discussed. Although the disease mechanism has not been completely elucidated, phenotypic and penetrance data are becoming available. Controversy still exists concerning the role of genetic testing in diagnosis and population screening.	11427444
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Role of the hemochromatosis gene in prophyria cutanea tarda. Prospective study of 56 cases].	Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie	2001	0.58	The cause of iron overload in prophyria cutanea tada is unknown. The aim of this work was to determine the frequency of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) in 56 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda. We analyzed the relationship between HFE mutations and biochemical abnormalities in porphyria cutanea tarda and the interaction with other triggering factors of porphyria cutanea tarda (alcohol abuse, hepatitis C, drugs). Hepatitis C, alcohol abuse, drug intake and HFE mutations were determined in 56 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (44 men and 12 women). Iron status was determined from transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum ferritin. Liver metabolism was determined from liver chemistries: alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Thirty-nine patients (69.4 p. 100) carried HFE mutations, 18 (32.1 p. 100) were H63D heterozygous, 4 (7.1 p. 100) were H63D homozygous, 9 (16 p. 100) C282Y heterozygous, 8 (14.2 p. 100) compound C282Y/H63D heterozygous and none were C282Y homozygous. Comparison between porphyria cutanea tarda with and without mutations showed that compound C282Y/H63D heterozygous status was significantly linked to iron overload: transferrin saturation=0.61 vs 0.39 (p=0.0001) and serum iron=32.9 vs 22.4 (p=0.0046). H63D homozygous status was linked to iron overload but non-significantly: transferrin sturatin=0.53 vs 0.39 (p=0.06). The class with high iron overload (transferrin saturation > 0.45) was not linked with triggering factors of porphyria cutanea tarda. Hepatatic cytolysis was linked to alcohol abuse and hepatitis C but not to HFE mutations. The frequencies of HFE mutations in Lyons France are halfway between Anglo-Saxon and Italian papers, highlighting the Celtic origin of C282Y mutation. Compound heterozygous and to a lesser degree H63D homozygous status explained the highest iron overload in our patients. This favors clinical expression of porphyria cutanea tarda. This iron overload due to HFE mutations is a new triggering factor of porphyria cutanea tarda independent of classical triggering factors: mutation of the erythrocytic uroporpyrinogen decarbocylase gene, alcohol abuse, hepatitis C, and drugs.	11427792
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis gene mutations in a clustered Italian population: evidence of high prevalence in people of Celtic ancestry.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2001	4.58	Hereditary haemochromatosis is an inherited disorder characterised by an excessive iron absorption from the diet and is associated with several HFE gene mutations. One hypothesis is that these genetic mutations originated in the Celtic populations. The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of HFE gene mutations in a clustered Italian population of Celtic ancestry (Cimbri, Asiago plateau). One hundred and forty-nine consecutive unrelated blood donors (31 females and 118 males) were enrolled in this study. A family investigation was performed in each case to identify the ethnic origin of the individuals. The analysis of HFE gene mutations was performed by PCR amplification followed by digestion with RsaI and DpnII restriction enzymes. At least one HFE gene mutation was identified in 49 individuals (32.9%) of the studied population. The allele frequencies of the C282Y and H63D were respectively 0.037 and 0.144. When we considered only the 103 individuals with relatives born in Asiago, the prevalence of the HFE mutations rose from 32.9 to 39.8%; the allele frequencies of the C282Y and H63D were respectively 0.048 and 0.174. The mean serum iron and ferritin levels were significantly higher in individuals with the HFE mutations than in normal cases. This study indicates that the prevalence of the HFE gene mutations is surprisingly high in Italians with Celtic ancestry. This could suggest the need to perform large mass studies in selected areas of the country to detect the affected patients and prevent the disease in homozygous individuals.	11436126
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	An unhappy triad: hemochromatosis, porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatocellular carcinoma-a case report.	World journal of gastroenterology	2007	2.79	Liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are predisposing factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hemosiderosis has also been described to trigger carcinogenesis. A significant iron overload, as found in hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC), is a risk factor for HCC and may also promote the symptoms of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). A 68-year old male patient presented to our clinic with a suspected HCC, elevated alpha-fetoprotein but normal liver function tests. He reported a 25 year-old history of vitiligo upon exposure to sunlight. The patient underwent an extended left hemihepatectomy, and the recovery was uneventful, with the exception of a persistent hyperbilirubinemia. Perfusion problems and extrahepatic cholestasis were ruled out by CT-scan with angiography and MR-cholangiopancreatography. However, MRI showed an iron overload. Histology confirmed the HCC (pT3, pN0, G3, R0) and revealed a portal fibrosis and hemosiderosis. Based on the skin lesions we suspected a PCT that was confirmed by laboratory tests showing elevated porphyrin, uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin and porphobilinogen. Concurrently, molecular diagnostics revealed homozygosity for the C282Y mutation within the hemochromatosis HFE gene. After phlebotomy and normalization of liver function tests the patient was discharged. This is the first case ever showing the unusual combination of HCC in a fibrotic liver with HHC and PCT. This diagnosis not only warrants oncological follow-up but also symptomatic therapy to normalize iron metabolism and thereby improve liver function and alleviate the symptoms of HHC and PCT. Thus progression of fibrosis may be prevented and liver regeneration supported.	17461505
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A novel homozygous frameshift deletion c.471del of HFE associated with hemochromatosis.	Clinical genetics	2007	3.89	A 47-year-old white male patient who manifested biochemical evidence of iron overload was found not to be a carrier of the three most common mutations, C282Y, H63D and S65C, of the HFE gene. Sequencing of the patient's entire HFE-coding region revealed a presence of a previously undescribed frameshift deletion c.471del in exon 3 resulting in a premature termination of a nonsense HFE protein. Interestingly, the patient was a homozygous carrier of this novel mutation and his hemochromatosis phenotype can be explained by the fact that he has no intact HFE protein. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of a complete loss of function of the HFE gene because of a homozygous mutation. The patient's son was found to be a heterozygous carrier of the mutation and has so far exhibited no indications of iron overload. Similarly, A*02-B*40/A*02-B*40 homozygous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype was determined in the patient and heterozygous A*02-B*40/A*03-B*35 HLA genotype in his son. Thus, the novel HFE frameshift deletion c.471del was linked to the HLA-A*02-B*40 haplotype.	17470136
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutation H63D predicts risk of iron over load in thalassemia intermedia irrespective of blood transfusions.	Indian journal of pathology & microbiology	2007	0.5	Iron overload is a well-documented complication in thalassemia intermedia. Moreover, it is seen that the number of blood transfusions received does not correlate with the degree of overload. Since, HFE gene is associated with iron overload; the present study was conducted in an attempt to evaluate its role in thalassemia intermedia. The subjects were consecutive thalassemia intermedia cases attending the Hematology outpatient clinic. Controls were healthy hospital staff with negative family history of hemolytic anemia or liver disease. The molecular analysis for HFE mutations H63D and C282Y were done with primers described earlier. ELISA was used to measure serum ferritin. Sixty-three patients of thalassemia intermedia including 48 beta-homozygous/heterozygous thalassemia intermedia and 15 HbE-beta-thalassemia were studied. Six (12.5%) of the former and two (13.3%) of the latter were heterozygous for H63D; one of which, a 51-year old male also had clinical features of hemochromatosis. In healthy controls, prevalence of H63D heterozygosity was 7.5% (6/80). An interesting feature observed was that though the age and transfusions taken were similar in both groups, the serum ferritin greater than 500 ng/dl were observed in all patients (100%) with HFE mutation whereas it was seen in 12/42 (28.6 %) of patients without the mutation (p = 0.002). Thus, it is concluded that thalassemia intermedia patients with co-existent HFE mutation have a higher likelihood of developing iron overload and may require early iron chelation.	17474269
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Compound heterozygote (C282Y/H63D) of hereditary hemochromatosis in a 16-year-old girl with hypoplastic kidney.	International journal of hematology	2007	1.85	Iron-overload diseases are associated with primary or secondary disturbances of iron metabolism. Hereditary hemochromatosis, a genetically heterogeneous disease that is characterized by increased iron absorption and progressive deposition in parenchymal cells, may lead to organ damage and failure. Molecular studies have shown that hemochromatosis type 1 is predominantly due to a mutation in the HFE gene; there are 2 major mutations (C282Y and H63D). Disease symptoms are observed mostly after 40 years of age, often in men. We report the unusual case of a 16-year-old girl with an elevated serum iron level and a hypoplastic kidney. Identification of heterozygosity for the HFE gene mutation C282Y/H63D confirmed the diagnosis of hemochromatosis type 1. The early detection of hemochromatosis in the presented case may delay organ damage and failure due to iron overload.	17483072
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	SLC40A1 Q248H allele frequencies and Q248H-associated risk of non-HFE iron overload in persons of sub-Saharan African descent.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	The ferroportin polymorphism SLC40A1 Q248H (exon 6, cDNA 744G-->T; Gln248His) occurs in persons of sub-Saharan African descent with and without iron overload, and is associated with elevated serum ferritin concentrations (SF). However, the risk of iron overload associated with Q248H has not been defined. We tabulated previously reported Q248H allele frequency estimates in African-Americans and Native Africans, and computed the risk of iron overload associated with Q248H in subjects who lacked HFE C282Y. The aggregate Q248H allele frequency in 1038 African-Americans in two cohorts from Alabama and one cohort each from Washington, DC and California was 0.0525 (95% CI: 0.0451, 0.0652); there was no significant difference in frequencies across these cohorts. The aggregate frequency in 259 Natives from southeast Africa in two cohorts was 0.0946 (95% CI: 0.0694, 0.1198); the difference between the frequencies of these cohorts was not significant. The aggregate Q248H frequencies in African-Americans and Native Africans differed significantly (0.0525 vs. 0.0946, respectively; p=0.0021). There were reports of 24 unrelated African-Americans and 15 unrelated Native Africans without HFE C282Y who had iron overload. In African-Americans, the odds ratio (OR) of Q248H-associated risk of iron overload using 610 C282Y-negative control subjects unselected for SF was 1.57 (95% CI: 0.52, 4.72; p=0.29). In Native Africans, the OR using 208 control subjects unselected for SF was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.28, 3.90; p=0.58). We conclude that the frequency of SLC40A1 Q248H is significantly lower in African-Americans than in Native Africans. Although OR estimates of iron overload in African-Americans and Native Africans with Q248H were greater than unity, the increased OR were not statistically significant.	17490902
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations in patients with type 2 diabetes and their control group in an Iranian population.	Saudi medical journal	2008	0.56	To assess the frequency of 2 different forms of hemochromatosis HFE gene mutations (C282Y and H63D mutations) in a normal population in comparison with type 2 diabetic patients. This case control study was undertaken in Zanjan Diabetic Care Center, Zanjan, western Tehran, in 2005. Two hundred and two individuals were included in this study: 101 type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, and 101 age, and gender-matched controls. The patients were examined for mutations in the HFE gene. Nucleotide 845 (C282Y) and 187 (H63D) alleles were amplified by polymerase chain reaction PCR with lymphocyte deoxy-ribonucleic acid. The PCR products were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion. Chi-square, student's t test, and Fisher's exact tests were used for comparison, and odds' ratio was calculated. Two hundred and two individuals were studied. The frequency of wild/C282Y alleles was 98/2% in T2DM patients, and 99/1% in controls p=0.6. The frequency of wild/H63D alleles was 68.3/31.7% in diabetics p=0.08, and 73.4/26.3% in control subjects p=0.08. The distribution of genotypes was not statistically different. Based on our data, HFE mutations were not found in excess in patients with T2DM, and there was no evidence that a population-based search for an excess of these alleles in type 2 diabetes was indicated.	18521456
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Involvement of ApoE E4 and H63D in sporadic Alzheimer's disease in a folate-supplemented Ontario population.	Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD	2008	0.5	Dysregulation of iron homeostasis is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this pilot study, common variants of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) and HFE genes resulting in the iron overload disorder of hereditary hemochromatosis (C282Y, H63D and S65C) were evaluated as factors in sporadic AD in an Ontario sample in which folic acid fortification has been mandatory since 1998. Laboratory studies also were done to search for genetic effects on blood markers of iron status, red cell folates and serum B12. Participants included 58 healthy volunteers (25 males, 33 females) and 54 patients with probable AD (20 males, 34 females). Statistical analyses were interpreted at the 95% confidence level. Contingency table and odds ratio analyses supported the hypothesis that in females of the given age range, E4 significantly predisposed to AD in the presence but not absence of H63D. In males, E4 significantly predisposed to AD in the absence of H63D, and H63D in the absence of E4 appeared protective against AD. Among E4+ AD patients, H63D was associated with significant lowering of red cell folate concentration, possibly as the result of excessive oxidative stress. However, folate levels in the lowest population quartile did not affect the risk of AD. A model is presented to explain the experimental findings.	18525129
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical utility and outcome of HFE-genotyping in the search for hereditary hemochromatosis.	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	2003	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), a disease involving iron accumulation in internal organs, occurs in about 1 in 200-400 Caucasians. The gene mutated in this disorder is termed HFE. The present study was designed to evaluate the diagnostic utility and outcome of genetic testing for HH in the service of public health care. 137 subjects were referred by health clinics and general hospitals for HFE genotyping from various parts of Finland during the period 1999-2001. Two major mutations (C282Y and H63D) were determined for each patient. Reasons contributing to referrals and sets of values for serum transferrin saturation (s-TS) and iron and ferritin concentrations were also determined. 16.8% of the subjects were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, together with seven C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes (5.1%). The rate of positive findings for the most typical mutations responsible for HH was found to have increased steadily during the period 1999-2001. Our data support a role for active testing for the C282Y and H63D mutations in health care. The fairly low number of genotyping requests nevertheless suggests that a large number of patients even with typical clinical signs or symptoms continue to escape detection.	12691865
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum ferritin level predicts advanced hepatic fibrosis among U.S. patients with phenotypic hemochromatosis.	Annals of internal medicine	2003	16.44	DNA-based HFE gene testing can confirm hereditary hemochromatosis in most people of Northern European descent. However, liver biopsy is important to detect cirrhosis. To develop noninvasive criteria to predict the presence or absence of advanced hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis in Americans with hemochromatosis. Cross-sectional study. Six tertiary care referral clinics. 182 patients with phenotypically defined hemochromatosis. Liver histopathology and serum ferritin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with cirrhosis (defined as bridging fibrosis or unequivocal cirrhosis on biopsy). Cirrhosis was present in 40 of 182 (22%) patients in the overall group and in 35 of 147 (24%) of C282Y homozygotes. Only 1 of 93 patients with a serum ferritin level less than 1000 microg/L had cirrhosis compared with 39 of 89 patients with serum ferritin levels greater than 1000 microg/L (P < 0.001). No C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes with serum ferritin levels less than 1000 microg/L had cirrhosis. Elevated serum aminotransferase levels (P = 0.001) and serum ferritin levels greater than 1000 microg/L (P = 0.001), but not age older than 40 years (P = 0.2), were independently associated with cirrhosis. In a multivariate model, the probability of cirrhosis was 7.4% among patients with serum ferritin levels less than 1000 microg/L compared with 72% among patients with serum ferritin levels greater than 1000 microg/L after adjustment for age and elevated serum liver enzyme levels. Patients with hemochromatosis and serum ferritin levels less than 1000 microg/L are unlikely to have cirrhosis. Liver biopsy to screen for cirrhosis may be unnecessary in such patients, regardless of age or serum liver enzyme levels.	12693884
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Porphyria cutanea tarda: the etiological importance of mutations in the HFE gene and viral infection is population-dependent.	Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)	2002	0.5	A number of factors, including increased iron stores and alcohol consumption, are known to be associated with the development of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) in susceptible individuals. Recent reports have described a significant association between inheritance of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene, associated with genetic hemochromatosis (GH) and PCT. A strong association between hepatitis C virus infection and PCT has also been demonstrated, while case reports record a link between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and PCT. We have investigated the frequency of these factors in a racially-mixed population of patients with PCT in Cape Town, South Africa. 57 patients with PCT drawn from three ethnic groups were screened for the presence of the C282Y and H63D mutations linked to GH, and the prevalences were compared with corresponding healthy control populations. The seroprevalence of markers for HCV, hepatitis B (HBV) and HIV infection were examined in 28 of these. In the control populations, we found that both the C282Y and H63D mutations are highly prevalent in South Africans of European origin. In a population of mixed or Asian origin, the C282Y mutation is very rare whereas the H63D mutation is common. Neither mutation was encountered in any African subject. Both mutations are associated with PCT, but the association is dependent on the ethnic origins of the population to which the patient belongs. In contrast to other studies, HCV infection is numerically unimportant in PCT in our patients. HIV infection is increasingly encountered in our patients with PCT, but the strength of the association cannot be determined in view of the high background prevalence of HIV infection in some sectors of the South African population. The contribution of specific risk factors may be heavily dependent on the population from which patients are drawn, and care should be taken in extrapolating from observations in one racial or geographic population to any other.	12699243
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Constitutive hepcidin expression prevents iron overload in a mouse model of hemochromatosis.	Nature genetics	2003	31.62	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a prevalent genetic disorder of iron hyperabsorption leading to hyperferremia, tissue iron deposition and complications including cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma, cardiomyopathy and diabetes. Most individuals affected with hereditary hemochromatosis are homozygous with respect to a missense mutation that disrupts the conformation of HFE, an atypical HLA class I molecule (ref. 1; OMIM 235200). Mice lacking Hfe or producing a C282Y mutant Hfe protein develop hyperferremia and have high hepatic iron levels. In both humans and mice, hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with a paucity of iron in reticuloendothelial cells. It has been suggested that HFE modulates uptake of transferrin-bound iron by undifferentiated intestinal crypt cells, thereby programming the absorptive capacity of enterocytes derived from these cells; however, this model is unproven and controversial. Hepcidin, a peptide hormone (HAMP; OMIM 606464), seems to act in the same regulatory pathway as HFE. Although expression of mouse Hamp is normally greater during iron overload, Hfe-/- mice have inappropriately low expression of Hamp. We crossed Hfe-/- mice with transgenic mice overexpressing Hamp and found that Hamp inhibited the iron accumulation normally observed in the Hfe-/- mice. This argues against the crypt programming model and suggests that failure of Hamp induction contributes to the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis, providing a rationale for the use of HAMP in the treatment of this disease.	12704388
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Regulatory defects in liver and intestine implicate abnormal hepcidin and Cybrd1 expression in mouse hemochromatosis.	Nature genetics	2003	31.62	Individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis suffer from systemic iron overload due to duodenal hyperabsorption. Most cases arise from a founder mutation in HFE (845G-->A; ref. 2) that results in the amino-acid substitution C282Y and prevents the association of HFE with beta2-microglobulin. Mice homozygous with respect to a null allele of Hfe (Hfe-/-) or homozygous with respect to the orthologous 882G-->A mutation (Hfe(845A/845A)) develop iron overload that recapitulates hereditary hemochromatosis in humans, confirming that hereditary hemochromatosis arises from loss of HFE function. Much work has focused on an exclusive role for the intestine in hereditary hemochromatosis. HFE deficiency in intestinal crypt cells is thought to cause intestinal iron deficiency and greater expression of iron transporters such as SLC11A2 (also called DMT1, DCT1 and NRAMP2) and SLC11A3 (also called IREG1, ferroportin and MTP1; ref. 3). Published data on the expression of these transporters in the duodenum of HFE-deficient mice and humans are contradictory. In this report, we used a custom microarray to assay changes in duodenal and hepatic gene expression in Hfe-deficient mice. We found unexpected alterations in the expression of Slc39a1 (mouse ortholog of SLC11A3) and Cybrd1, which encode key iron transport proteins, and Hamp (hepcidin antimicrobial peptide), a hepatic regulator of iron transport. We propose that inappropriate regulatory cues from the liver underlie greater duodenal iron absorption, possibly involving the ferric reductase Cybrd1.	12704390
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[From gene to disease; HFE-mutations in primary haemochromatosis].	Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde	2003	0.5	Primary haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with a high prevalence (1 in 200-400) among North-Europeans. Approximately 64-100% of patients with primary haemochromatosis are homozygous for a missense mutation that alters a major-histocompatibility-complex class I-like protein designated HFE (from 'haemochromatosis'). This predominant mutation is a substitution of cysteine to tyrosine at amino acid residue 282 (Cys282Tyr) in the alpha 3-domain of the HFE protein. This mutation in the HFE protein in the intestinal crypt cells is supposed to lead to up-regulation of iron transporters for dietary iron in the mucosal cells at the tip of the duodenal villi. As a consequence, an excess of absorbed iron accumulates in the major organs of the HFE-mutated patients, leading to multi-organ dysfunction. A second mutation, His63Asp, in the HFE-gene is enriched in primary haemochromatosis patients who are concomitantly heterozygous for the Cys282Tyr-mutation. However, its role in the pathophysiology of primary haemochromatosis is not yet clear. A small subgroup of patients with primary haemochromatosis do not have mutations in HFE; for some of them the genetic basis has been determined. Homozygosity for the Cys282Tyr-mutation plus biochemical and clinical evidence of iron overload renders the diagnosis of HFE-related primary haemochromatosis indisputable. In other cases, liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of primary haemochromatosis. First-degree relatives of index patients should be screened for the disease.	12712648
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Diagnosis of 5 patients with possible primary hemochromatosis].	Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde	2003	0.5	In a 49-year-old man and a 28-year-old woman, both of whom complained of fatigue, HFE-gen related respectively non-HFE-gen related primary haemochromatosis was diagnosed, based on the elevated serum transferrin saturation, the elevated serum ferritin levels, DNA studies and liver biopsy with qualitative respectively quantitative iron measurements. Their complaints diminished after bloodletting. Three women respectively 64, 61 and 46 years of age, were also suspected of primary haemochromatosis. The latter two presented with complaints of fatigue and malaise and chronic hepatitis C respectively. All three showed an elevated serum transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration. Further investigation showed the presence of secundary iron overload. Causes for it being excessive alcohol consumption, overweight and a poorly regulated diabetes mellitus type 2, and chronic hepatitis C respectively. These patients received specific therapy. Primary haemochromatosis is a common disorder of iron metabolism in individuals of Northern European descent. Diagnosis is based on an elevated serum transferrin saturation in combination with both elevated serum ferritin levels and homozygosity for the Cys282Tyr-mutation in the HFE-gen. The presence of an elevated serum transferrin saturation in combination with an elevated serum ferritin level is not always sufficient for the diagnosis, since these may be affected by other disorders. Moreover, iron overload may be caused by a form of haemochromatosis that is not HFE-related. In case of doubt as to the diagnosis, histological examination of the liver with a qualitative or quantitative iron determination is the golden standard.	12712652
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between the HFE mutations and unsuccessful ageing: a study in Alzheimer's disease patients from Northern Italy.	Mechanisms of ageing and development	2003	2.89	Mutations in the class I-like Major Histocompatibility Complex gene HFE are associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), a disorder caused by excessive iron uptake. Three common mutations have been found: C282Y, H63D, and S65C. Moreover, several studies have suggested that HFE mutations may be involved in several age-related chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and coronary heart disease, but apparently paradoxically also with longevity. In particular, in AD, patients carrying the H63D allele have been suggested to have a mean age at onset of 72 vs. 77 years for those who were homozygous for the wild-type allele. Thus, it seems that H63D mutations may anticipate sporadic AD clinical presentation in susceptible individuals. In the present study, we analysed the HFE genotype in 123 patients with sporadic AD and 152 age-matched controls from Northern Italy. Samples were typed for C282Y, H63D and S65C alleles using the polymerase chain reaction and sequence specific primers. No significant differences were observed in frequencies of the different alleles between controls and AD both for the whole group and when the data were analysed according to gender. In addition, we failed to observe any difference in the age at onset between patients carrying the mutant HFE-H63D allele and those homozygous for the wild-type allele, either in men or women. Also taking into account the presence or absence of the APOE-epsilon 4 allele, no significant differences were observed between carriers of the mutant HFE-H63D allele and those homozygous for the wild-type allele. Thus, our study does not support the suggestion that H63D mutations may anticipate sporadic AD clinical presentation in susceptible individuals.	12714262
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between the HFE mutations and longevity: a study in Sardinian population.	Mechanisms of ageing and development	2003	2.89	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an HLA-linked inherited disease characterised by inappropriately high absorption of iron by the gastrointestinal mucosa. The cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution at codon 282 of the HFE encoding gene sequence is responsible for the disease, although other variants, as H63D and S65C, may modify the affinity of the protein for transferrin receptors. We have recently reported that C282Y mutation is significantly increased in very old (>90 years) Sicilian women, suggesting a role in attainment of longevity. In addition, an increase of H63D polymorphism was also observed in these women but the difference was not significant. To validate and extend these results we investigated the distribution of these three common HFE gene mutations in Sardinian centenarians and controls. DNA samples, obtained from 61 controls and 57 Centenarians, were typed for HFE polymorphisms using sequence specific primers. Among the controls, none was heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, 15 were heterozygous for H63D mutation and one for S65C. Among the centenarians, none was heterozygous for the C282Y mutation whereas 25 were heterozygous for H63D mutation and four for the S65C mutation. No significant differences were observed in frequencies of the different alleles between young and centenarians both on the whole and when the data were analysed according to gender. However, there was a trend for an increased frequency of H63D allele in centenarian women (24 vs. 17%, i.e. 19/80 vs. 13/78). It is noteworthy that the cumulative frequency of H63D mutations in Centenarian and very old women from Sardinia and Sicily is 22 vs. 11%, i.e. 30/136 vs. 23/210, P=0.008. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that there may be a survival difference for centenarian women, among carriers and non-carriers of alleles involved in iron sparing.	12714263
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations in Greece.	Acta haematologica	2003	1.05	The frequencies of the hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations C282Y and H63D vary between different populations. There are a limited number of reports regarding the frequency of these mutations in populations of southeastern Europe. Two hundred and sixty-four adult individuals of Greek origin were examined for the C282Y and H63D mutations to determine the allele and genotype frequencies. The HFE gene region of DNA samples extracted from peripheral leukocytes was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Restriction enzyme analysis was performed using RSAI for C282Y and MBOI for H63D. None of the 264 individuals carried the mutation C282Y. Forty-three individuals (16.2%) were heterozygous carriers of the H63D allele and 2 were homozygous for this mutation (0.75%). The overall H63D allele prevalence is thus estimated at 8.9%. HFE mutation frequencies were low in the population studied and this may explain, in part, the relative rarity of clinical cases of hereditary hemochromatosis in Greece.	12714823
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Blunted increase in serum hepcidin as response to oral iron in HFE-hemochromatosis.	European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	2011	2.09	HFE hemochromatosis (HFE-H) is the most common and well-defined inherited cause for iron-related morbidity and mortality. Majority of patients with HFE-H are homozygote for C282Y mutation. Recent studies suggest that iron accumulation in most types of hemochromatosis is due to deficiency of hepcidin, a central iron regulator. However, the precise link between hepcidin levels and iron absorption in HFE-H patients has been poorly understood. To measure hepcidin response to oral iron challenge (200 mg ferrous sulphate), in HFE-H (C282Y/C282Y) patients and compare with healthy controls (HCs). Nine patients with C282Y/C282Y HFE-H along with 15 HC were recruited for the study. All HFE-H were iron depleted and studied at a time distant to phlebotomy. Hepcidin was measured using a published immunoassay method after ingestion of 65 mg oral iron challenge. Serum iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation were measured using standard methods. The area under the curve was calculated and compared between the two groups. The basal serum hepcidin levels in patients with HFE-H were significantly low as compared with HC (P=0.0002). Incremental serum hepcidin response seen in HC reached significance at 4 h post iron challenge (P=0.0085) returning to baseline only at 24 h. There was no significant hepcidin response in HFE-H at 4 h (P=0.294). The overall hepcidin response was significantly lower in HFE-H compared with HC (area under the curve: P=0.0127). Failure to mount a rapid hepcidin response to an oral iron challenge is the key mechanisms of iron accumulation despite prevailing excess body iron in patients with HFE-H with C282Y/C282Y mutation.	21654321
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron overload and HFE gene mutations in Polish patients with liver cirrhosis.	Hepatobiliary & pancreatic diseases international : HBPD INT	2011	1.72	Increased liver iron stores may contribute to the progression of liver injury and fibrosis, and are associated with a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma development. Pre-transplant symptoms of iron overload in patients with liver cirrhosis are associated with higher risk of infectious and malignant complications in liver transplant recipients. HFE gene mutations may be involved in the pathogenesis of liver iron overload and influence the progression of chronic liver diseases of different origins. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of iron overload in relation to HFE gene mutations among Polish patients with liver cirrhosis. Sixty-one patients with liver cirrhosis included in the study were compared with a control group of 42 consecutive patients subjected to liver biopsy because of chronic liver diseases. Liver function tests and serum iron markers were assessed in both groups. All patients were screened for HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D, S65C). Thirty-six of 61 patients from the study group and all controls had liver biopsy performed with semiquantitative assessment of iron deposits in hepatocytes. The biochemical markers of iron overload and iron deposits in the liver were detected with a higher frequency (70% and 47% respectively) in patients with liver cirrhosis. There were no differences in the prevalence of all HFE mutations in both groups. In patients with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, no significant associations with iron disorders and HFE gene mutations were found. Iron disorders were detected in patients with liver cirrhosis frequently but without significant association with HFE gene mutations. Only the homozygous C282Y mutation seems to occur more frequently in the selected population of patients with liver cirrhosis. As elevated biochemical iron indices accompanied liver iron deposits more frequently in liver cirrhosis compared to controls with chronic liver disease, there is a need for more extensive studies searching for the possible influence of non-HFE iron homeostasis regulators and their modulation on the course of chronic liver disease and liver cirrhosis.	21669570
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of the C282Y mutation in Brittany: penetrance of genetic hemochromatosis?	Annales de genetique	1998	0.5	Hemochromatosis (GH) is an inborn error of iron metabolism, characterized by progressive iron loading that, if untreated, causes high morbidity and death. The gene responsible for the disease (HFE), located 4.5 megabases telomeric to the HLA-A locus, encodes a protein homologous to class I MHC molecules. A main mutation, C282Y, has been identified within the gene. Although hemochromatosis is considered as the most frequent inherited disease in the populations of Northern European origin, its prevalence in Brittany had not been evaluated yet. In this issue we report the C282Y mutation frequency in a cohort of 1000 newborns from maternity hospitals of the four breton départements. The homozygote frequency was 5/1000 and heterozygote frequency was 12%; such high frequencies raise the question of the penetrance of the disease and the relevance of systematic genotypic screening for hemochromatosis.	9881181
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Patients with type 2 diabetes have a high frequency of the C282Y mutation of the hemochromatosis gene.	Clinical and investigative medicine. Medecine clinique et experimentale	1998	0.5	To determine whether a specific mutation (C282Y) associated with primary hemochromatosis (PHC) is more common in patients with type 2 diabetes than in a control group of patients with type 1 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes have a two- to threefold higher rate of PHC than the general population. Recent identification of a genetic mutation in patients with PHC raises the possibility that the mutation is related to type 2 diabetes. Cross-sectional study. One hundred and five patients with type 2 diabetes and 103 control patients with type 1 diabetes, who attended the same tertiary care diabetes clinic, who were of European origin, and in whom there was no clinical suspicion of hemochromatosis. Patients completed a brief clinical assessment and provided a blood sample. Iron studies were measured in serum, and DNA was assayed for the presence of the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. Twenty-three of 105 patients (21.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 14.0, 29.8) with type 2 diabetes (1 homozygote) and 12 of 103 patients (11.7%; 95% CI 5.5, 17.9) with type 1 diabetes (all heterozygotes) had at least 1 copy of the C282Y mutation (odds ratio [OR] = 2.1; 95% CI 1.0, 4.5; p = 0.048). Neither serum ferritin nor transferrin saturation level identified patients with a C282Y mutation. The C282Y gene mutation is a potential genetic marker for type 2 diabetes. It, or a closely linked gene, may be associated with greater than 20% of cases of type 2 diabetes.	9885759
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Kupffer cell staining by an HFE-specific monoclonal antibody: implications for hereditary haemochromatosis.	British journal of haematology	1998	5.4	Hereditary haemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of iron absorption that leads to excessive iron storage in the liver and other organs. A candidate disease gene HFE has been identified that encodes a novel MHC class I like protein. We report the development of a monoclonal antibody (HFE-JB1) specific for recombinant refolded HFE protein. The antibody immunoprecipitates a 49 kD protein from the cell line U937, a histiocytic lymphoma. It binds HFE but does not recognize other recombinant non-classic MHC class I proteins (HLA-E, F and G), nor does it react with a variety of recombinant classic class I MHC molecules. COS cells transfected with HFE in culture are stained specifically. The immunohistochemical staining pattern in human tissues is unique and can be defined as a subset of the transferrin receptor positive cells. In the liver HFE protein was shown to be present on Kupffer cells and endothelium (sinusoidal lining cells), but absent from the parenchyma. Kupffer cells from an untreated C282Y HH patient failed to stain with the antibody. In the normal gut scattered cells in the crypts are stained. HFE was also present on capillary endothelium in the brain (a site of high levels of transferrin receptor) and on scattered cells in the cerebellum and cortex. These results raise interesting questions concerning the function of HFE in the control of body iron content and distribution.	9886303
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis: pathological or beneficial.	Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift	1998	0.5	Genetic haemochromatosis (GH) is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders in northern Europe. The majority of patients (approaching 90%) are homozygous for a single mutation (C282Y) of the HFE gene. The significance of a second mutation (H63D) in causing iron accumulation is not yet clear. The studies which led to the identification of the HFE gene are described along with recent work on mutation frequencies in various populations and functional studies of the HFE protein. Genetic testing and measurement of transferrin saturation provide the means to carry out widespread testing for the prevention of iron overload and its clinical consequences. The reason why the mutation has spread throughout Europe is not yet known and questions remain about the clinical penetrance of GH.	9887470
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A PCR-SSP method for detecting the His63Asp mutation in the HFE gene associated with hereditary haemochromatosis.	Molecular pathology : MP	1998	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease in which there is defective regulation of iron absorption, causing gradual accumulation of excessive amounts of iron in certain organs. Recently, a candidate gene for hereditary haemochromatosis has been identified, located on the short arm of chromosome 6, telomeric to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and showing sequence homology to the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I genes. Two mutations have been found in this gene that are potential markers for haemochromatosis. The first, a cysteine to tyrosine substitution (Cys282Tyr) is strongly associated with the disease, whereas the second mutation, a histidine to aspartic acid substitution (His63Asp) shows a less obvious relation. To examine the importance of this second mutation in hereditary haemochromatosis it is important to study the links between this genotype and abnormalities of iron metabolism. A polymerase chain reaction method using sequence specific primers is described which might be useful for identifying those individuals carrying the mutation that encodes the His63Asp substitution, who might be at risk from a milder form of haemochromatosis.	9893753
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for hereditary haemochromatosis.	Pathology	2012	2.97	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder of iron overload in Caucasian populations. Clinical manifestations usually occur in individuals homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene product and who have developed significant iron loading. Current screening methods can detect affected individuals either prior to or early during disease evolution, enabling early introduction of phlebotomy treatment that can normalise life expectancy. Evaluation of possible iron overload, via measurement of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin level, is the most appropriate initial test for those subjects presenting clinically for evaluation. HFE genotyping, when combined with serum biochemical measurements, defines the presence of likely iron overload and the underlying genetic disorder and is the preferred initial screening modality for families of an affected individual. Definitive proof of iron overload requires measurement of hepatic iron concentration or total iron burden via therapeutic phlebotomy; elevated serum ferritin level alone is not adequate. We now recognise that the natural history of HH is not as discrete as previously believed, because genetic and environmental modifiers of disease penetrance are increasingly identified as influencing the clinical expression of HH. In fact, a minority of C282Y homozygotes develop classical 'iron overload disease', although it has recently emerged that the disorder may predispose to breast and colorectal cancer. Uncertainties as to the true clinical impact of the condition at a population level lead to current recommendations of cascade screening of families of affected patients, case-finding in high-risk groups, such as patients with clinical manifestations consistent with the diagnosis, and a high level of clinical awareness in the community to facilitate early diagnosis. Generalised population screening is not presently recommended.	22198253
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE C282Y homozygosity is associated with an increased risk of total hip replacement for osteoarthritis.	Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism	2012	3.95	The evidence for an association between mutations in the HFE (hemochromatosis) gene and the risk of hip or knee osteoarthritis is inconsistent. Total joint replacement is considered a surrogate measure for symptomatic end-stage osteoarthritis. We examined the relationship between HFE gene mutations and risk of total hip and knee replacement using a prospective cohort study. The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study recruited participants between 1990 and 1994. Participants born in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, or Ireland (n = 27,848) were genotyped for the HFE C282Y mutation. Total hip and knee replacements for osteoarthritis during 2001 to 2009 were ascertained from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry. Hazard ratios (HR)/odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) were obtained from Cox regression or logistic regression. Compared with those with no C282Y mutation, C282Y homozygotes had an increased risk of single total hip replacement (HR 1.94, 95% CI 1.04-3.62) and bilateral total hip replacement (OR 5.86, 95% CI 2.36-14.57) for osteoarthritis, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and educational level. Only 3 C282Y homozygotes had single total knee replacement; the HR was 0.51 (95% CI 0.16-1.57). C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity was not related to the risk of total hip or knee replacement. HFE C282Y homozygosity was associated with an increased risk of both single and bilateral total hip replacement for osteoarthritis.	22209421
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Factors influencing disease phenotype and penetrance in HFE haemochromatosis.	Human genetics	2010	5.14	Haemochromatosis is predominantly associated with the HFE p.C282Y homozygous genotype, which is present in approximately 1 in 200 people of Northern European origin. However, not all p.C282Y homozygotes develop clinical features of haemochromatosis, and not all p.C282Y homozygotes even present abnormal iron parameters justifying venesection therapy. This situation was not apparent from initial genotype/phenotype correlation studies as there was a selection bias of patients. Only those patients with a significant iron burden were included in these early studies. It is now largely accepted that the p.C282Y/p.C282Y genotype is necessary for the development of HFE haemochromatosis. However, this genotype provides few clues as to why certain symptoms are associated with the disease. Expression of iron overload in people with this genotype depends on the complex interplay of environmental factors and modifier genes. In this review, we restrict our discussion to work done in humans giving examples of animal models where this has helped clarify our understanding. We discuss penetrance, explaining that this concept normally does not apply to autosomal recessive disorders, and discuss the usefulness of different biochemical markers in ascertaining iron burden. Hepcidin, a peptide synthesized primarily by the liver, has been identified as the central regulator in iron homeostasis. Consequently, understanding its regulation is the key. We conclude that the main goal now is to identify important modifiers that have a significant and unambiguous effect on iron storage.	20607553
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	N-glycosylation is important for the correct intracellular localization of HFE and its ability to decrease cell surface transferrin binding.	The FEBS journal	2010	0.5	HFE is a type 1 transmembrane protein that becomes N-glycosylated during transport to the cell membrane. It influences cellular iron concentrations through multiple mechanisms, including regulation of transferrin binding to transferrin receptors. The importance of glycosylation in HFE localization and function has not yet been studied. Here we employed bioinformatics to identify putative N-glycosylation sites at residues N110, N130 and N234 of the human HFE protein, and used site-directed mutagenesis to create combinations of single, double or triple mutants. Compared with the wild-type protein, which co-localizes with the type 1 transferrin receptor in the endosomal recycling compartment and on distributed punctae, the triple mutant co-localized with BiP in the endoplasmic reticulum. This was similar to the localization pattern described previously for the misfolding HFE-C282Y mutant that causes type 1 hereditary haemachromatosis. We also observed that the triple mutant was functionally deficient in beta2-microglobulin interactions and incapable of regulating transferrin binding, once again, reminiscent of the HFE-C282Y variant. Single and double mutants that undergo limited glycosylation appeared to have a mixed phenotype, with characteristics primarily of the wild-type, but also some from the glycosylation-deficient protein. Therefore, although they displayed an endosomal recycling compartment/punctate localization like the wild-type protein, many cells simultaneously displayed additional reticular localization. Furthermore, although the majority of cells expressing these single and double mutants showed decreased surface binding of transferrin, a number appeared to have lost this ability. We conclude that glycosylation is important for the normal intracellular trafficking and functional activity of HFE.	20618438
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The iron-chelating potential of silybin in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis.	European journal of clinical nutrition	2010	2.94	Milk thistle contains silybin, which is a potential iron chelator. We aimed to determine whether silybin reduced iron absorption in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis. In this crossover study, on three separate occasions, 10 patients who were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene (and fully treated) consumed a vegetarian meal containing 13.9 mg iron with: 200 ml water; 200 ml water and 140 mg silybin (Legalon Forte); or 200 ml tea. Blood was drawn once before, then 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after the meal. Consumption of silybin with a meal resulted in a reduction in the postprandial increase in serum iron (AUC±s.e.) compared with water (silybin 1726.6±346.8 versus water 2988.8±167; P<0.05) and tea (silybin 1726.6±346.8 versus tea 2099.3±223.3; P<0.05). In conclusion, silybin has the potential to reduce iron absorption, and this deserves further investigation, as silybin could be an adjunct in the treatment of haemochromatosis.	20628405
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Molecular genetic analysis in mild hyperhomocysteinemia: a common mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene is a genetic risk factor for cardiovascular disease.	American journal of human genetics	1996	10.79	Mild hyperhomocysteinemia is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Genetic aberrations in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) genes may account for reduced enzyme activities and elevated plasma homocysteine levels. In 15 unrelated Dutch patients with homozygous CBS deficiency, we observed the 833T-->C (I278T) mutation in 50% of the alleles. Very recently, we identified a common mutation (677C-->T; A-->V) in the MTHFR gene, which, in homozygous state, is responsible for the thermolabile phenotype and which is associated with decreased specific MTHRF activity and elevated homocysteine levels. We screened 60 cardiovascular patients and 111 controls for these two mutations, to determine whether these mutations are risk factors for premature cardiovascular disease. Heterozygosity for the 833T-->C mutation in the CBS gene was observed in one individual of the control group but was absent in patients with premature cardiovascular disease. Homozygosity for the 677C-->T mutation in the MTHFR gene was found in (15%) of 60 cardiovascular patients and in only 6 (approximately 5%) of 111 control individuals (odds ratio 3.1 [95% confidence interval 1.0-9.2]). Because of both the high prevalence of the 833T-->C mutation among homozygotes for CBS deficiency and its absence in 60 cardiovascular patients, we may conclude that heterozygosity for CBS deficiency does not appear to be involved in premature cardiovascular disease. However, a frequent homozygous mutation in the MTHFR gene is associated with a threefold increase in risk for premature cardiovascular disease.	8554066
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The effect of HFE mutations on serum ferritin and transferrin saturation in the Jersey population.	British journal of haematology	1998	5.4	High frequencies of the haemochromatosis-related HFE C282Y mutation have been reported in North European populations, in which a high proportion of patients with the disease are homozygotes. However, the degree of penetrance of this genotype is unknown. We determined the HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes of 411 consenting volunteer blood donors on Jersey, and the serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels of 204 of these volunteers. The C282Y allele frequency was found to be 8.3% in 822 chromosomes, indicating a homozygote frequency of 1/145. Consistent with this, four C282Y homozygotes were detected in 411 volunteers. As there are only 18 patients presently receiving treatment for haemochromatosis on Jersey, out of a total population of about 85000, there is a large discrepancy between the number of haemochromatosis patients and the number of C282Y homozygotes in this population. In a preliminary study of 204 consenting volunteers we found a correlation between transferrin saturation and HFE H63D/ C282Y genotype (P=0.017) and between serum ferritin and genotype (P = 0.056). We also observed elevated values of transferrin saturation in the two C282Y homozygotes assayed. These results suggest that a large proportion of the many undetected C282Y homozygotes on Jersey and in similar populations could be in the preclinical stages of haemochromatosis, and warrant investigation. However, there may be a wide variation in the expression of the condition, and a more extensive study of the level of disease penetrance encompassing a large number of hitherto undetected C282Y homozygotes is therefore imperative.	9609537
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Porphyria cutanea tarda, hepatitis C, and HFE gene mutations in North America.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	1998	0.5	In some, but not all countries, porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) has been associated with chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Recently, PCT has also been associated with mutations in the HFE gene that are associated with HLA-linked hereditary hemochromatosis. Until now, few studies of these associations have been reported from North America. The aims of this study were: 1) to assess the prevalence of HCV infection and HFE mutations in North American patients with PCT; 2) to compare demographic and laboratory features between those who are HCV-positive and HCV-negative; and 3) to study urinary porphyrin excretions in American HCV-positive patients without clinically manifest PCT. Clinical and laboratory data, including tests for HCV and urinary porphyrins, were collected from 70 unselected patients with typical PCT. Urinary porphyrins were also measured in 110 non-PCT patients with chronic hepatitis C. Mutational analyses of the HFE gene were performed in 26 PCT patients. Thirty-nine of 70 (56%) of the PCT patients had evidence of HCV infection. Thirty-two of 39 PCT patients with HCV were men, all of whom used alcohol. In contrast, 22 of 31 PCT patients without HCV infection were women, 12 of whom had taken estrogens. The HCV-positive group was more likely to have used illicit intravenous drugs (45% vs. 0%; P = 0.01), to have had several (>4) sex partners (48% vs. 13%; P = 0.005), and less likely to have no known risk factors for HCV infection (33% vs. 78%; P = 0.004). Total urinary porphyrin excretion was the same in the two groups, but those with HCV infection had a significantly lower percentage of uroporphyrin and higher percentages of hepta-and hexa-carboxy porphyrins in urine. Sixteen of 110 (15%) HCV-positive subjects without PCT had increased urinary porphyrins, but, unlike PCT, these were mainly coproporphyrin. Forty-two percent of PCT patients carried the C282Y mutation of HFE (15% homozygous), and another 31% carried the H63D mutation (8% homozygous). Thus, 73% of PCT patients had one of these mutations. The prevalence of HCV infection (56%) and mutations in the HFE gene (73%) are high among North American patients with PCT. Alcohol and estrogen use are important additional risk factors. All PCT patients should be tested for HCV infection and for HFE gene mutations. Although HCV infection is a trigger for PCT, preclinical PCT is rare in chronic HCV hepatitis C in the United States.	9620340
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Heterozygosity for hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with more fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	1998	0.5	Hepatic iron has been associated with more aggressive liver disease in chronic viral hepatitis. We evaluated whether the recently described C282Y mutation of the hemochromatosis gene, designated HFE (responsible for at least 83% of hereditary hemochromatosis), was associated with more advanced liver disease in chronic hepatitis C. One hundred thirty-seven patients with biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis C were studied and liver biopsies scored for necroinflammation (grade 0-18) and fibrosis (stage 0-6). Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and the C282Y mutation identified by restriction with RsaI and electrophoretic separation of restriction fragments. Ten (7.3%) patients had the C282Y mutation. No C282Y homozygous patients were identified. Age, sex distribution, and estimated weekly alcohol consumption were not significantly different between those with and without the mutation. Serum ferritin was higher in the heterozygotes (mean, 339 microg/L) compared with homozygous wild types (153 microg/L; P = .0005). In the majority of patients, liver iron was graded 0 out of 4, but hepatocyte iron staining was more commonly present in heterozygotes compared with homozygous normals (30% compared with 4% [P = .02]). Liver disease was more advanced in those with the mutant allele (mean fibrosis stage: 3.6, compared with wild type: 1.5 [P = .01]). Cirrhosis was found more often in those with the mutation (40%) compared with those without (8.7%) (P = .01; odds ratio: 7.6 [1.9-31.2]). There was no significant difference in inflammation scores between heterozygotes and wild type (mean, 5.4 compared with 4.1). Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA titers were measured by branched DNA assay (HCV RNA 2.0-Chiron), and there was no difference between heterozygous and homozygous normal patients. Thus, despite relatively minor increases in iron stores, individuals who are heterozygous for hemochromatosis appear to develop more fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C. Venesection may be useful therapy in this subgroup.	9620344
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis in Sweden.	Journal of internal medicine	1998	7.8	To determine the frequency of mutations (C282Y and H63D) in a newly identified gene HFE in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) in Sweden. Molecular genetic analyses of the HFE gene (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by enzyme restriction) were performed in genomic DNA from unrelated patients with a clinical diagnosis of HH and in healthy subjects. Patients with HH treated with phlebotomies at Karolinska Hospital and Huddinge Hospital were analyzed. Eighty-seven unrelated patients with HH and 117 healthy controls. It was found that the HFE C282Y mutation occurs in 94.2% of chromosomes from patients with HH. Eighty patients (92.0%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation and one was heterozygous. Three patients were heterozygous for both C282Y and H63D mutations. One patient was homozygous and one was heterozygous for the H63D mutation. One patient carried normal alleles. In healthy controls, the C282Y mutation occurred in nine subjects (7.7%), all of which were heterozygous. The H63D mutation was found in 28 control subjects, one of which was homozygous. We found that the majority of patients with HH have the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. The frequency of the H63D mutation was higher in controls than in patients with HH, although in chromosomes at risk the frequency of the H63D mutation was higher in patients.	9627157
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Implications of genotyping of spouses to limit investigation of children in genetic hemochromatosis.	Clinical genetics	1998	3.89	A genetic test for hemochromatosis has allowed for the first time, genotypic identification of heterozygotes. The purpose of this study is to determine whether genotyping of spouses of homozygotes results in fewer investigations of children and subsequent cost savings. Two hundred and ninety one children of homozygotes were studied using HLA typing, transferrin saturation and serum ferritin. Ninety six percent of the probands were homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. Pedigrees were reviewed to determine cost savings incurred if the spouse had been genotyped to guide follow-up studies in the children. Paternity was confirmed by HLA studies. There were 13 homozygotes identified. All homozygous children tested (10/10) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. There were no iron loaded children identified in homozygotes negative for the C282Y mutation. Genotyping of the spouse eliminated the need for the investigation of 269 children. The cost savings of this strategy were modeled using the cost of the family studies (consultation, iron studies) minus the cost of spouse assessment (consultation, genotyping) plus the cost of assessment of children in families in which the spouse was a heterozygote. The spousal genotyping strategy resulted in a cost savings of 39%. Genotying the spouse of a homozygote is the best cost-efficient strategy in pedigree studies because it leads to more selective investigation of children for the hemochromatosis gene.	9630070
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis mutations in North-East Scotland.	British journal of haematology	1999	5.4	The HFE gene and its mutations C282Y and H63D cause hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). Among 54 affected individuals from North-East Scotland, 91% were homozygous for C282Y and 5.5% were compound heterozygotes for C282Y and H63D. The general population allele frequencies were high (8% and 15.7% for C282Y and H63D respectively). Although it is likely that HH is under diagnosed, these figures suggest that disease expression is variable, and many of those with the genetic predisposition HH will never develop the clinical consequences of iron overload. This has implications for diagnosis and predictive testing.	10460595
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Is the hemochromatosis gene a modifier locus for cystic fibrosis?	Genetic testing	1998	0.5	The variable clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) suggest the influence of modifier genes. For example, meconium ileus is present in approximately 10-15% of neonates with cystic fibrosis; however, the genetic and, or environmental factors that determine whether an individual will develop this complication have not been determined. We propose the HFE gene as a candidate modifier locus for CF based on (1) the suggestion of an association between the HLA loci and CF phenotypes; (2) the location of the HFE gene near the HLA loci and; (3) the similarity between the gastrointestinal manifestations of hereditary hemochromatosis and CF. We have determined the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations in a group of 89 CF patients who were homozygous for delta F508 and for whom meconium ileus status was known. The carrier frequency of C282Y among the CF patients with meconium ileus was significantly different from that of our unaffected control group (19.4% versus 7.7%). However, the difference between the meconium ileus and the nonmeconium ileus groups was not significant (19.4% versus 10.3%). There was no difference in the frequency of the H63D among the three groups that were studied. These data are suggestive of a relationship between the development of meconium ileus or other gastrointestinal diseases in CF and the HFE gene. Further study of a larger group of patients is warranted.	10464603
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A population-based study of the clinical expression of the hemochromatosis gene.	The New England journal of medicine	1999	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene on chromosome 6, elevated serum transferrin saturation, and excess iron deposits throughout the body. To assess the prevalence and clinical expression of the HFE gene, we conducted a population-based study in Busselton, Australia. In 1994, we obtained blood samples for the determination of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels and the presence or absence of the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation (which may contribute to increased hepatic iron levels) in 3011 unrelated white adults. We evaluated all subjects who had persistently elevated transferrin-saturation values (45 percent or higher) or were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. We recommended liver biopsy for subjects with serum ferritin levels of 300 ng per milliliter or higher. The subjects were followed for up to four years. Sixteen of the subjects (0.5 percent) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, and 424 (14.1 percent) were heterozygous. The serum transferrin saturation was 45 percent or higher in 15 of the 16 who were homozygous; in 1 subject it was 43 percent. Four of the homozygous subjects had previously been given a diagnosis of hemochromatosis, and 12 had not. Seven of these 12 patients had elevated serum ferritin levels in 1994; 6 of the 7 had further increases in 1998, and 1 had a decrease, although the value remained elevated. The serum ferritin levels in the four other homozygous patients remained in the normal range. Eleven of the 16 homozygous subjects underwent liver biopsy; 3 had hepatic fibrosis, and 1, who had a history of excessive alcohol consumption, had cirrhosis and mild microvesicular steatosis. Eight of the 16 homozygous subjects had clinical findings that were consistent with the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis, such as hepatomegaly, skin pigmentation, and arthritis. In a population of white adults of northern European ancestry, 0.5 percent were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. However, only half of those who were homozygous had clinical features of hemochromatosis, and one quarter had serum ferritin levels that remained normal over a four-year period.	10471457
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis in adults without pathogenic mutations in the hemochromatosis gene.	The New England journal of medicine	1999	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis in adults is usually characterized by mutations in the HFE gene on the short arm of chromosome 6. Most patients have a substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at position 282 (C282Y). We studied a large family from Italy that includes persons who have a hereditary iron-overload condition indistinguishable from hemochromatosis but without apparent pathogenic mutations in the HFE gene. We performed biochemical, histologic, and genetic studies of 53 living members of the family, including microsatellite analysis of chromosome 6 and direct sequencing of the HFE gene. Of the 53 family members, 15 had abnormal serum ferritin levels, values for transferrin saturation that were higher than 50 percent, or both. Thirteen of the 15 had elevated body iron levels, diagnosed on the basis of the clinical evaluation and liver biopsy, and underwent iron-removal therapy. The other two, both children, did not undergo liver biopsy or iron-removal therapy. None of the 15 members had the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene; 5 of the 15 (as well as 5 healthy relatives) had another mutation of this gene, a substitution of aspartate for histidine at position 63, but none were homozygous for it. No other mutations were found after sequencing of the entire HFE gene for all family members. Microsatellite analysis showed no linkage of the hemochromatosis phenotype with the short arm of chromosome 6, the site of the HFE gene. Hereditary hemochromatosis can occur in adults who do not have pathogenic mutations in the hemochromatosis gene.	10471458
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The influence of hemochromatosis mutations on iron overload of thalassemia major.	Haematologica	1999	6.67	Hemochromatosis is a genetic form of iron overload due to a defective HFE gene. Secondary iron overload is the main complication in transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients. In this work we have examined the prevalence of HFE mutations in thalassemia major and evaluated the degree of iron overload of patients with and without HFE mutations. HFE mutations were studied in 71 Italian thalassemic patients and in 189 normal controls, using PCR and restriction enzyme analysis. The degree of iron overload, assessed by serum ferritin and liver iron concentration (LIC), was compared in 17 patients with mutations in the HFE gene, and in 17 subjects with wild type HFE genotype. The two groups of patients had comparable globin gene mutations, were matched for age and were homogeneous for transfusion and chelation history. In all cases the iron balance calculated on the basis of transfusion regimen and iron excreted by chelation was available. The allele frequencies of C282Y and H63D were respectively 1.4% and 12.7% in patients and 1.1% and 11.4% in controls. No case of C282Y homozygosity was recorded among patients. No significant difference was found in terms of serum ferritin, LIC, or the age at chelation start between patients with and without HFE mutations. The single patient with H63D homozygosity was severely iron-loaded. Our data suggest that the presence of a single mutation in the HFE gene does not influence the severity of iron loading in thalassemia patients following a regular transfusion and chelation program.	10477452
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genotyping of the hemochromatosis HFE p.H63D and p.C282Y mutations by high-resolution melting with the Rotor-Gene 6000® instrument.	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	2011	3.02	The genotyping of HFE p.C282Y and p.H63D mutations is one of the most requested molecular analyses in the laboratorial routine. In this scenario, the main aim was to develop a genotyping assay that has advantages compared to other methods. Genotypes for the HFE p.C282Y (c.G845A; rs1800562) and p.H63D (c.C187G, rs1799945) mutations were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by high resolution melting (HRM) analysis with the Rotor-Gene 6000(®) instrument. Validation studies were conducted in samples bi-directionally sequenced. The melting assay was developed in a unique procedure and to ensure the result in approximately 112 min (31 min for sample preparation and 81 min for the PCR-HRM step). Genotypes for the HFE p.C282Y mutation were easily distinguished in the region of 80-86°C. For the HFE p.H63D, genotypes were also easily distinguished in the region of 76-82°C, but using the addition of known wild-type genotype DNA in all unknown samples plus a reaction without addition. In validation, genotypes were 100% concordant between methods. Our genotyping assay with the Rotor-Gene 6000(®) instrument applies to the laboratorial routine with several advantages, especially in large-scale demand. The main advantages were the non-dependence on gel electrophoresis and on mutagenic reagents for visualization of fragments, reduction of the chances for contamination due to sample preparation, the lack of use of probe-based methods and cost-effectiveness.	21679129
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The use of a reverse hybridization strip assay for the study of hemochromatosis-associated gene mutations in Lebanon.	Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers	2011	1.3	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is the most commonly identified autosomal recessive genetic disorder in the Caucasian population and HFE gene mutations are highly concentrated among European populations. This is the first study that screens for HHC-related gene mutations in a healthy Lebanese sample population. Using the reverse hybridization Hemochromatosis StripAssay A from ViennaLab, the DNA extracted from a total of 116 healthy volunteers (59 males and 57 females) was analyzed, looking for 18 different mutations in the HFE, ferroportin, and transferrin genes. For the HFE gene, the C282Y mutation was not detected, but the H63D mutation was found with an overall carrier frequency of 25.8% (24.1% heterozygous and 1.7% homozygous). None of the mutations in the transferrin and ferroportin genes was identified. The Hemochromatosis StripAssay A from ViennaLab provides an easy and reliable technique for simultaneous screening of the different HFE gene mutations. This first study in Lebanon represents a baseline report for further future studies in the field using this easy technique with a reasonable turnaround time for diagnosis. We also note that ferroportin and transferrin gene mutations have not been detected in this population sample and larger clinical studies will be needed to better estimate their prevalence.	21689013
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between HFE polymorphisms and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis of 22 studies including 4,365 cases and 8,652 controls.	Molecular biology reports	2012	1.7	Whether the variations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene increase Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk is still undetermined. We performed a meta-analysis in order to systematically summarize the possible association. Studies were identified by searching PUBMED, Web of Science and EMBASE databases complemented with screening the references of the retrieved studies. The association was measured using random-effect or fixed-effect odds ratio (OR) combined with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to the studies' heterogeneity. For C282Y polymorphism, we did not find any association using data from 22 studies including 4,365 cases and 8,652 controls. For H63D polymorphism, on the basis of 2,795 cases and 7,424 controls from 17 studies, we observed a significant association (allele contrast: OR = 0.902, 95% CI = 0.819-0.994, P = 0.037; minor-allele-dominant model: OR = 0.887, 95% CI = 0.790-0.996, P = 0.043). No publication bias was detected in this meta-analysis. The synthesis of available evidence supports mutant of HFE H63D polymorphism plays a protective role for AD risk.	21701828
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Porphyria cutanea tarda, C282Y, H63D and S65C HFE gene mutations and hepatitis C infection: a study from southern France.	Dermatology (Basel, Switzerland)	2003	0.5	To evaluate the role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) and their association with chronic hepatitis C. To investigate the relations between hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations and PCT in the south of France and their links with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The genotype for the C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations of HFE was determined in 33 patients with PCT, 46 patients with HCV infection but without PCT and 58 controls. Iron status and HCV, HBV and HIV serologies were studied in all patients. A statistically significant increase in the C282Y mutation was found in PCT patients. No difference was found for H63D or S65C mutations. The prevalence of HCV infection was higher in PCT patients than controls. C282Y mutations and HCV infection but not H63D or S65C mutations are PCT-triggering or associated factors in the south of France.	12673077
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A population-based study of the effect of the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations on iron metabolism.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2003	4.58	The C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene are important causes of hemochromatosis. In the elderly, these mutations might be associated with increased morbidity because of the lifelong accumulation of iron. In a population-based sample of the elderly, we determined the value of genotyping for HFE mutations to screen for subclinical hemochromatosis. HFE genotype frequencies were determined in a random group of 2095 subjects (55 years and over). In this random group, we selected within the six genotype groups a total of 342 individuals and measured their serum transferrin saturation, iron and ferritin levels. We also estimated the heritability and parameters needed to evaluate screening, including the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) of HFE genotypes. Iron parameters were significantly increased in subjects homozygous, heterozygous or compound heterozygous. The effect of the mutations was more pronounced in men than in women. For the H63D mutation, an allele dose effect was observed. The HFE gene explained about 5% of the variability in serum iron indices. The PPV for hemochromatosis for the C282Y homozygous was 100% in men and 67% in women. The NPV of the wild-type allele was 97% for both men and women. The sensitivity of both mutations was 70% for men and 52% for women and the specificity was 62% for men and 64% for women. Our study shows that the HFE C282Y and H63D are determinants of iron parameters in the elderly and will be effective in detecting individuals at high risk of hemochromatosis. However, when screening based on these two mutations, some individuals with subclinical hemochromatosis will be missed.	12673276
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Health implications of iron overload: the role of diet and genotype.	Nutrition reviews	2003	5.59	The relationship between high dietary iron intake, mutations of the HFE gene, and iron status, and their effects on human health are reviewed. Prolonged high dietary intakes of iron are unlikely to result in iron overload in the general population. Homozygotes for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene have elevated body iron levels. Heterozygotes have normal iron stores but some may be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. There is no convincing evidence that elevated iron status increases the risk of coronary heart disease or type 2 diabetes, but high iron intakes may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. The dietary levels of iron associated with health risks in different HFE genotypes must be determined.	12674437
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hereditary hemochromatosis].	Der Internist	2003	0.5	Four types of hereditary haemochromatosis have been identified. Type 1 is due to a point mutation in the HFE gene (C282Y) and leads via an increase in intestinal iron absorption to iron overload and organ damage. Type 2 is a juvenile form with manifestation before age 30; it affects both gender and is associated with severe cardiomyopathy and hypogonadism. The genetic defect of type 3 is located on chromosome 7q22 and affects the transferrin receptor 2. The consequences of type 3 are similar to those of type 1. The autosomal-dominant type 4 is located on chromosome 2q32 and affects the basolateral iron carrier ferroportin 1. In contrast to types 1 and 3 iron deposits in type 4 are seen predominantly in macrophages; in type 4 serum ferritin is significantly increased although transferrin saturation is only slightly abnormal. The prognosis of haemochromatosis is normal when phlebotomy therapy is started prior to manifestation of cirrhosis or diabetes. Screening strategies should be implemented to improve early detection.	12674739
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Penetrance of hemochromatosis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	We undertook a three-year screening program for mutations of the HFE gene among 41,000 subjects attending the Kaiser Permanente Health Appraisal Center in San Diego, California. Our results show that the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene associated with hemochromatosis have measurable and consistent effects on iron indicators and are associated with liver disorders, but have no measurable effect on other iron overload-related symptoms and life-expectancy. The very low clinical penetrance of the HFE mutations must be taken into account in calculating cost/benefit and risk/benefit ratios in screening for hemochromatosis.	12678056
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of HFE and TFR2 mutations in selected blood donors with biochemical parameters of iron overload.	Haematologica	2003	6.67	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a recessive condition characterized by iron accumulation in several organs, followed by organ damage and failure. The disorder is prevalently due to C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene, but additional HFE and TFR2 mutations have been reported. Early iron overload may be assessed by biochemical parameters such as increased transferrin saturation and serum ferritin. Taking advantage of the collection of 178 DNA samples selected for increased transferrin saturation (>50% in males and >45% in females) from a previous large scale screening of Italian blood donors, we simultaneously assessed the presence of 14 hemochromatosis-associated molecular defects (11 of HFE and 3 of TFR2) by a reverse hybridization-based strip assay. In the series studied the overall C282Y allele frequency was 9% and that of the H63D and S65C was 22.2% and 1.4%, respectively. One rare HFE allele (E168Q), but no TFR2 mutation was detected. When checked at a second examination, transferrin saturation was significantly higher in C282Y homozygotes, H63D/ C282Y compound heterozygotes and H63D homozygotes as compared to wild-type subjects (p<0.05). Our results confirm previous findings on C282Y and H63D mutations in Italy, show that the C282Y allele frequency is enriched in samples selected for altered iron parameters, and that a few rare genotypes are present in Northern Italy. None of the known TFR2 mutations was identified in this series confirming the preliminary indication of their rare occurrence. Subjects with hemochromatosis-associated genotypes show a persistently higher mean transferrin saturation than do those with wild type genotypes.	12681966
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Primary haemochromatosis: a missed cause of chronic fatigue syndrome?	The Netherlands journal of medicine	2002	0.5	To determine whether patients previously diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) actually have primary haemochomatosis (PH). The setting was a Dutch referral centre. Transferrin saturation (TS) was retrospectively evaluated in banked blood samples of 88 patients diagnosed as CFS. Patients with elevated TS values were asked to provide a new overnight fasting blood sample for a second determination of TS and measurement of serum ferritin. The DNA was investigated for mutations in the HFE gene when one of these iron parameters was elevated. For 19 out of 88 patients with CFS an elevated TS was found. A new blood sample was obtained from 11 of these 19: six had increased TS and two had elevated serum ferritin values. These eight patients were neither C282Y homozygotes nor compound C282Y-H63D heterozygotes. In the eight cases where no new blood samples could be obtained, the TS was > 50% for two of the five men and < 45% for the three female patients. In a group of 88 CFS patients we could exclude PH in all but two of them (prevalence 2.3%; 95% confidence interval 0-5.5%). In our population of CFS patients PH is not more common than in a control population of northern European descent (prevalence 0.25-0.50%).	12685490
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Role of hemochromatosis genes in chronic hepatitis C.	La Clinica terapeutica		0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is commonly associated with iron overload and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Association between hemochromatosis C282Y or H63D mutation has been observed, although not uniformly, and iron overload is also commonly found in chronic HCV hepatitis. This study explored the contribution of genetic hemochromatosis to iron accumulation in hepatitis C. Review of current literature. The prevalence of increased serum iron stores in patients with HCV infection is 28% (patients having an elevated ferritin or transferrin saturation). Patients with elevated serum iron markers have more active chronic hepatitis with more liver fibrosis. In the opinion of the experts HFE mutations are not associated with a high hepatic iron content. No relation was detected between hepatic iron stores and HFE gene mutation. Significant iron deposition in the liver was uncommon and overall the quantity of iron that was detectable histologically and biochemically was unrelated to the grade and stage of HCV related liver injury. The mechanism by which liver iron accumulates in patients is unclear. Carriage of HFE mutations does not have a role in the accumulation of iron or the liver disease in HCV. These findings do not support a role for iron depletion in patients with chronic HCV infection, including these with elevated serum studies.	16669553
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of common HFE variants in the Saudi population: a high throughput molecular beacon-based study.	BMC medical genetics	2006	2.09	Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder highlighted by iron-overload. Two popular mutations in HFE, p.C282Y and p.H63D, have been discovered and found to associate with HH in different ethnic backgrounds. p.C282Y and p.H63D diagnosis is usually made by restriction enzyme analysis. However, the use of this technique is largely limited to research laboratories because they are relatively expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to transform into a high throughput format. Single nucleotide variations in target DNA sequences can be readily identified using molecular beacon fluorescent probes. These are quenched probes with loop and hairpin structure, and they become fluorescent upon specific target recognition. We developed high throughput homogeneous real-time PCR assays using molecular beacon technology, to genotype p.C282Y and p.H63D variants. Representative samples of different genotypes for these variants were assayed by restriction enzyme analysis and direct sequencing as bench mark methods for comparison with the newly developed molecular beacon-based real-time PCR assay. Complete concordance was achieved by all three assay formats. Homozygotes (mutant and wildtype) and heterozygotes were readily differentiated by the allele specific molecular beacons as reported by the associated fluorophore in the real-time assay developed in this study. Additionally, these assays were used in a high throughput format to establish the allele frequency of C282Y and H63D in Saudis for the first time. These assays may be reliably applied as a diagnostic test or large scale method for population screening.	16672055
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The overlapping of local iron overload and HFE mutation in venous leg ulcer pathogenesis.	Free radical biology & medicine	2006	0.5	Chronic venous stasis determines red blood cell extravasation and either dermal hemosiderin deposits or iron-laden phagocytes. Several authors have suspected that iron could play a role in the pathogenesis of venous leg ulcers. They hypothesized that local iron overload could generate free radicals or activate a proteolytic hyperactivity on the part of metalloproteinases (MMPs) or else down-regulate tissue inhibitors of MMPs. However, they were unable to explain why iron deposits, visible in the legs of patients with chronic venous disease (CVD), cause lesions in only some individuals, whereas in others they do not. We hypothesized that such individual differences could be genetically determined and investigated the role of the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. C282Y mutation significantly increases the risk of ulcer in primary CVD more than six times (OR = 6.69; 1.45-30.8; p = 0.01). Patients carrying the H63D variant have an earlier age of ulcer onset, by almost 10 years (p > 0.004). The increased risk of skin lesion and the early age of onset of the disease in HFE carriers confirm in a clinical setting that intracellular iron deposits of mutated macrophages have less stability than those of the wild type. We hypothesize that the physiologic iron protective mechanisms are affected by the HFE mutations and should be investigated in all diseases characterized by the combination of iron overload and inflammation.	16678024
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	External quality assurance of molecular analysis of haemochromatosis gene mutations.	Journal of clinical pathology	2006	2.91	The Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia Quality Assurance Programs has conducted an external quality assurance programme for the testing of the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations C282Y and H63D. A total of 10 surveys have been undertaken over a period of 6 years from 2000 to 2005. Of the 3016 responses received, the overall success rate was found to be 99.47% (3000/3016). A total of 16 errors were found, 6 for C282Y and 10 for H63D. Only one sample was associated with more than one error, in which 2 of 23 respondents classified a normal sample as heterozygotic for H63D. Overall performance was observed to vary minimally between surveys, from a low of 91.3% correct (21/23 responses) for a normal sample to 100% correct in most (85/100) samples. Of the 10 complete surveys, four returned a 0% error rate. In one survey in 2004, seven incorrect responses were returned by one laboratory, all of which were secondary to transcriptional errors. Overall success rates per assay were 99.61% (1532/1538) for C282Y and 99.32% (1468/1478) for H63D. Over a period of 6 years from 2000 to 2005, the proportion of respondents using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme analysis fell from 85% to around 30%, whereas the proportion of laboratories using real-time PCR rose from 5% to around 55%, as indicated by the questionnaire surveys of methods used by participants. Encouraging levels of testing proficiency for two common genetic mutations are indicated by these data, but they also confirm the need for participation of molecular diagnostic laboratories in external quality assurance programmes to ensure the ongoing provision of high-quality genetic testing services.	16679356
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotyping in patients with elevated serum iron indices and liver diseases.	BioMed research international	2015	2.13	Iron abnormalities in chronic liver disease may be the result of genetic diseases or secondary factors. The present study aimed to identify subjects with HFE-HH in order to describe the frequency of clinical manifestations, identify risk factors for iron elevation, and compare the iron profile of HFE-HH to other genotypes in liver disease patients. A total of 108 individuals with hepatic disease, transferrin saturation (TS) > 45%, and serum ferritin (SF) > 350 ng/mL were tested for HFE mutations. Two groups were characterized: C282Y/C282Y or C282Y/H63D genotypes (n = 16) were the HFE hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE-HH) group; and C282Y and H63D single heterozygotes, the H63D/H63D genotype, and wild-type were considered group 2 (n = 92). Nonalcoholic liver disease, alcoholism, and chronic hepatitis C were detected more frequently in group 2, whereas arthropathy, hepatocarcinoma, diabetes, and osteoporosis rates were significantly higher in the HFE-HH group. TS > 82%, SF > 2685 ng/mL, and serum iron > 178 μg/dL were the cutoffs for diagnosis of HFE-HH in patients with liver disease. Thus, in non-Caucasian populations with chronic liver disease, HFE-HH diagnosis is more predictable in those with iron levels higher than those proposed in current guidelines for the general population.	25654085
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	An unusual case of hemochromatosis due to a new compound heterozygosity in HFE (p.[Gly43Asp;His63Asp]+[Cys282Tyr]): structural implications with respect to binding with transferrin receptor 1.	Human mutation	2008	5.09	Most adults affected with HFE hereditary hemochromatosis (HH type 1, MIMmusical sharp 235200) are homozygous for the p.Cys282Tyr mutation in HFE (NC_000006.10, region 26195427 to 26205038). The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular basis of iron overload in a patient presenting with severe clinical HH with one c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) allele only. Molecular and pedigree studies demonstrated the presence of the c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) mutation in one allele whereas the other carried the c.187C>G (p.His63Asp) mutation plus a new c.128G>A (p.Gly43Asp) substitution in cis. A molecular modeling study of the p.[Gly43Asp;His63Asp] and p.His63Asp variants versus the wild type was carried out using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in presence of implicit solvent. We found that the c.187C>G (p.His63Asp) mutation does not introduce any major change in the 1- domains of HFE whereas the c.128G>A (p.Gly43Asp) substitution is responsible for a modification of the dynamics and the structure of the Gln40-Ser45 loop, a critical region for HFE-TfR1 interaction thus impairing HFE-TfR1 normal contact. We conclude that the occurrence of complex alleles may be an alternative explanation for the variability of the phenotype in individuals who are compound heterozygous for c.[187C>G]+[845G>A] (p.[His63Asp]+[Cys282Tyr]).	18157833
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of common HFE and SERPINA1 mutations in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in a Moroccan population.	Archives of medical research	2008	2.22	Hereditary hemochromatosis and SERPINA1 mutation were reported to affect liver functions. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of HFE and SERPINA1 (formerly known as alpha1-antitrypsin, AAT) mutations and assess their influence on hepatocellular carcinoma development. This study included 222 controls and 96 cases with hepatocellular carcinoma. PCR-RFLP was used to characterize S and Z alleles in SERPINA1, as well as C282Y/H63D alleles of HFE. In healthy subjects and hepatocellular carcinoma patients as well, no homozygotes for the C282Y mutation were found. In controls, heterozygosity and homozygosity for the H63D mutation were 27 and 0.9%, respectively. Among patients, homozygosity for the H63D mutation was 3.1%, whereas heterozygosity for C282Y and H63D was 2.1 and 35.4%, respectively. Interestingly, albeit it does not reach significance (p=0.062), H63D was more prevalent in hepatocellular carcinoma patients than in controls (38.5 vs. 27.9%, respectively). The association was stronger when considering only male patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (47.1 vs. 23.6, p=0.001). Allele frequencies of S and Z in controls were 0.45% (95% CI=0.2-1.07) and 0.22% (95% CI=0.2-0.6), respectively, and 1 for S and 0% for Z in HCC. No significant difference was found between cases and controls. We provide a novel appraisal of HFE and SERPINA1 mutations prevalence in the Moroccan population. Results are consistent with the worldwide spread of the H63D and S mutation and the north European restriction of the C282Y and Z. Our results show that H63D carriage is increased among hepatocellular carcinoma patients, suggesting that it may confer an increased susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma even in a heterozygous state. On the contrary, HFE C282Y and SERPINA1 mutations do not contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma development.	18164971
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association of familial pernicious anaemia and hereditary haemochromatosis.	Acta haematologica	2008	1.05	We report the case of a 54-year-old patient presenting with a typical pernicious anaemia. His mother was diagnosed with unquestionable pernicious anaemia 5 years previously. Serum ferritin was strongly increased (1,160 microg/l, normal range 29-380), with a transferrin saturation of 95%. We found a homozygous C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in our patient, his mother being heterozygous. The son of our patient was compound C282Y/H63D heterozygous without detectable pernicious anaemia. This seems to be the first report of an association between familial pernicious anaemia and hereditary haemochromatosis. The simultaneous occurrence of the 2 diseases in the same patient helps to delineate the relative contribution of each of them to iron metabolism and erythropoiesis: iron overload was only moderately increased and responded rapidly to phlebotomies, whereas haemochromatosis did not modify the cytologic presentation of pernicious anaemia.	18176074
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haplotype analysis of the H63D, IVS2+4t/c, and C282Y polymorphisms of the HFE gene reveals rare events of intragenic recombination.	European journal of haematology	2008	2.54	Two missense mutations of the HFE gene, one (C282Y) being a major gene for hereditary hemochromatosis and the other (H63D) playing a minor role in this disease, are carried by different haplotypes. Among other sequence variants of HFE, IVS2+4t/c polymorphism has been reported as a possible splicing mutation or risk modifier. Our aims were to identify sequence variants possibly associated with iron overload in our population, to study the intragenic haplotypes of the HFE gene, and to evaluate the role of IVS2+4t/c in hyperferritinemia. We screened by direct sequencing the coding sequence and intron-exon boundaries of HFE in 265 patients with hyperferritinemia and 185 subjects from the general population. Linkage disequilibrium between the three pairs of polymorphic sites was complete between H63D and C282Y, whereas all four gametic types were present for both the H63D-IVS2+4t/c and the IVS2+4t/c-C282Y site pairs. The data supported a model in which the IVS2+4t/c polymorphism was ancestral, the D(63) mutation occurred on the t chromosome, and the Y(282) mutation occurred on the c chromosome; after the population spread of both mutations, intragenic recombination occurred on both sides of the t/c polymorphism, generating the rare haplotypes D(63)-c(IVS2+4)-C(282) and H(63)-t(IVS2+4)-Y(282). The IVS2+4c/t is a neutral polymorphism with regard to risk of iron overload. The presence of recombinant haplotypes on both its sides suggests a considerable evolutionary age of the two main risk alleles.	18182079
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene variants, iron, and lipids: a novel connection in Alzheimer's disease.	Frontiers in pharmacology	2014	4.42	Iron accumulation and associated oxidative stress in the brain have been consistently found in several neurodegenerative diseases. Multiple genetic studies have been undertaken to try to identify a cause of neurodegenerative diseases but direct connections have been rare. In the iron field, variants in the HFE gene that give rise to a protein involved in cellular iron regulation, are associated with iron accumulation in multiple organs including the brain. There is also substantial epidemiological, genetic, and molecular evidence of disruption of cholesterol homeostasis in several neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the efforts that have been made to identify factors that can trigger the pathological events associated with neurodegenerative diseases they remain mostly unknown. Because molecular phenotypes such as oxidative stress, synaptic failure, neuronal loss, and cognitive decline, characteristics associated with AD, have been shown to result from disruption of a number of pathways, one can easily argue that the phenotype seen may not arise from a linear sequence of events. Therefore, a multi-targeted approach is needed to understand a complex disorder like AD. This can be achieved only when knowledge about interactions between the different pathways and the potential influence of environmental factors on them becomes available. Toward this end, this review discusses what is known about the roles and interactions of iron and cholesterol in neurodegenerative diseases. It highlights the effects of gene variants of HFE (H63D- and C282Y-HFE) on iron and cholesterol metabolism and how they may contribute to understanding the etiology of complex neurodegenerative diseases.	25071582
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Results communication and patient education after screening for possible hemochromatosis and iron overload: experience from the HEIRS Study of a large ethnically and linguistically diverse group.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics	2007	7.71	We assessed the effectiveness of educational interventions for conveying clinical findings and information about hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and iron overload (IO) to individuals evaluated clinically after initial screening for HH/IO with serum ferritin (SF) concentration, transferrin saturation (TS), and HFE genotyping. A questionnaire mailed to 2300 cases and controls 1 month after a letter summarizing clinical findings measured understanding of results and recommendations, knowledge of HH/IO, and satisfaction with information received. Of 1622 (70.5%) participants completing relevant items, 83.6% were satisfied with receiving initial screening results by mail, 93.4% found information clear and easy to understand, 89.2% generally felt they got enough information, but 47.5% still had questions. C282Y/C282Y homozygosity with normal TS/SF predicted the best understanding of genetic results. Many with no mutations thought relatives were at risk. Iron levels created most confusion, and a third incorrectly recalled treatment recommendations. Having any abnormal result, lower education, older age, and being non-white, and/or non-English speaking predicted lower understanding. Combining genotypic and phenotypic screening for HH/IO creates additional difficulties in communicating results-particularly to those with low health literacy. Explaining aberrant iron TS and SF levels and low-risk genotypes, follow-up recommendations, and risk to relatives will need creative, culturally appropriate strategies.	18007147
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotype influences erythropoiesis support requirement in hemodialysis patients: a prospective study.	American journal of nephrology	2008	2.6	HFE protein controls iron absorption and cycling, and HFE mutations influence iron status. The aim was to evaluate the effect of the HFE genotype on the need for iron and erythropoietin in Italian hemodialysis patients. Ninety-six prevalent patients were evaluated at the time of enrolment and prospectively followed for 3 years. Patients were given r-HuEPO and Fe3+-gluconate according to guidelines. The HFE genotype was determined by restriction analysis. Three patients (3%) carried the C282Y mutation, 4 (4%) were homozygous and 18 (19%) heterozygous for the H63D mutation, and 71 (74%) were negative for both. At enrolment, subjects positive for HFE mutations had higher iron stores (ferritin 617 +/- 663 vs. 423 +/- 386 ng/ml, p = 0.05), were receiving less iron (82.5 +/- 66 vs. 110 +/- 154 mg/month, p = 0.05) and a lower r-HuEPO dosage (98 +/- 83 vs. 142 +/- 138 U/kg/week, p = 0.03). Consistently during the study period, patients positive for HFE mutations received a lower amount of r-HuEPO (94.5 +/- 63 vs. 186 +/- 344 U/kg/week, p = 0.01) and iron (97 +/- 63 vs. 121 +/- 68 mg/month, p = 0.07). Upon Cox regression analysis, after adjustment for confounding variables, the presence of HFE mutations was associated with a reduced risk of death (HR 0.6, 95% CI 0.34-1.03, p = 0.06). HFE mutations reduce the amount of r-HuEPO and iron necessary to support erythropoiesis in hemodialysis.	18025780
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Evidence for the high importance of co-morbid factors in HFE C282Y/H63D patients cared by phlebotomies: results from an observational prospective study.	PloS one	2013	3.06	Despite type I haemochromatosis (HC) is mainly associated with the HFE C282Y/C282Y genotype, a second genotype -C282Y/H63D- has mostly been described in other patients. Its association with HC, apart from any associated co-morbid factors, remains unclear and complex to interpret for physicians. This study assesses the weight of this genotype and the role of co-morbid factors in the occurrence of iron overload. This prospective study included the C282Y/C282Y (n = 172) and C282Y/H63D (n = 58) patients enrolled in a phlebotomy program between 2004 and 2007 in a blood centre of western Brittany (Brest, France), where HC is frequent. We compared prevalence of these two genotypes, as well as patients' profile regarding degree of iron overload and prevalence of co-morbid factors. First, we confirmed the obvious deficit of C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes among patients cared by phlebotomies. This genotype was 3.0 times less frequent than the C282Y/C282Y genotype among those patients (18.9% vs. 56.0%) whereas it was 4.9 times more frequent in the general population (4.3% vs. 0.9%; p<0.0001). Despite a similar level of hyperferritinaemia, the C282Y/H63D patients who came to medical attention had a milder plasma iron overload, reflected by a lower transferrin saturation median (52.0% vs. 84.0%; p<0.0001). They also exhibited more frequently co-morbid factors, as heavy drinking (26.0% vs. 13.9%; p = 0.0454), overweight (66.7% vs. 39.4%; p = 0.0005) or both (21.3% vs. 2.6%; p<0.0001). Ultimately, they required a lower amount of iron removed to reach depletion (2.1 vs. 3.4 g; p<0.0001), clearly reflecting their lower tissue iron. This study confirms that H63D is a discrete genetic susceptibility factor whose expression is most visible in association with other co-factors. It highlights the importance of searching for co-morbidities in these diagnostic situations and of providing lifestyle and dietary advice.	24339903
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	High prevalence of the His63Asp HFE mutation in Italian patients with porphyria cutanea tarda.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	1998	0.5	Sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is caused by a reduced activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) in the liver. Mild to moderate iron overload is common in PCT, as iron is one of the factors which trigger the clinical manifestations of the disease through the inactivation of URO-D. A role for genetic hemochromatosis in the development of iron overload in sporadic PCT has been hypothesized in the past. The aim of this work was to investigate whether mutations of HFE, which is a candidate gene for hemochromatosis, play the role of genetic susceptibility factors for PCT in Italian patients, who have a high prevalence of acquired triggering factors, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic infection and alcohol. We determined HFE genotypes of 68 male patients with PCT. Our data do not confirm an association of PCT with the Cys282Tyr HFE mutation, strongly associated with hemochromatosis in Northern European countries. A second mutation of HFE, His63Asp, however, had a significantly increased frequency as it was present in half of the patients. Surprisingly, the presence of the His63Asp mutation was not related to the iron status of patients, suggesting that a subtle abnormality of iron metabolism induced by this mutation could escape detection by the standard parameters of iron status. In PCT patients with liver disease, the presence of the mutation could contribute to the inactivation of URO-D, either directly or through a synergistic action with other factors that cause liver damage.	9425935

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of the H63D mutation of the HFE in north India: its presence does not cause iron overload in beta thalassemia trait.	European journal of haematology	2005	2.54	To determine the allele frequency in the north Indian population of the two mutations in the HFE gene, the C282Y and H63D, which are responsible for causing hereditary haemochromatosis particularly in Caucasians of north European descent. We also wanted to correlate these mutations with the iron status in beta thalassemia traits. Sixty normal subjects and 215 individuals with beta thalassemia trait from north India were screened for the C282Y and H63D by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). We studied the iron status in these subjects and correlated the same with the HFE gene mutations. On screening for the C282Y gene mutation, all individuals were detected to be of the wild-type. The overall allele frequency of H63D was 9.09% with three individuals being homozygous for 63D. No statistically significant difference in the iron status was detected between the individuals of the wild-type and mutant for H63D. Haplotyping of the homozygous 63D alleles revealed the pattern to be identical to the Europeans. Our study shows that H63D is prevalent and C282Y is rare in north Indians and the presence of 63D mutation does not increase body iron as measured by serum ferritin in beta thalassemia traits. Haplotype of H63D gene mutation is of an European haplotype, indicating a common origin.	15777346
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence and clinical implications of HFE gene mutations (C282Y and H63D) in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C in Taiwan.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2005	4.47	The implication of hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations in chronic viral hepatitis remains controversial. We therefore studied the prevalence of HFE mutations and their impact on the progression of chronic viral hepatitis in Taiwan. H63D and C282Y mutations were screened by using polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism in 152 chronic hepatitis B patients with various stages of liver disease, 87 chronic hepatitis C patients with various stages of liver disease, and 49 healthy controls. The distribution of each allele frequency was then compared among different groups of patients and in various stages of liver disease. All three groups of patients were C282Y wild type and the majority of H63D mutations were heterozygotes. Although statistically not significant, allele frequencies of H63D mutation in hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis (6%) and hepatitis C-related liver cirrhosis (9.1%) were higher than those in healthy control (2%). After adjustment for age and sex, hepatitis B patients with H63D heterozygosity had a higher likelihood of cirrhosis than those with H63D wild type (odds ratios (OR): 3.2, confidence interval (CI): 0.49-20.5, P = 0.22). Similarly, hepatitis C patients with H63D homozygosity had a higher likelihood of cirrhosis compared with those with H63D wild type (OR: 2.35, CI : 0.19-28.5, P = 0.52). Almost all Taiwanese are C282Y wild type. H63D heterozygote and homozygote, occurring in less than 5% of the subjects, tended to be associated with the development of liver cirrhosis, irrespective of viral etiology. Screening for H63D mutation might be considered in patients with chronic viral hepatitis in Taiwan.	15780041
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genome-wide association study identifies TF as a significant modifier gene of iron metabolism in HFE hemochromatosis.	Journal of hepatology	2015	10.59	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is the most common form of genetic iron loading disease. It is mainly related to the homozygous C282Y/C282Y mutation in the HFE gene that is, however, a necessary but not a sufficient condition to develop clinical and even biochemical HH. This suggests that modifier genes are likely involved in the expressivity of the disease. Our aim was to identify such modifier genes. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using DNA collected from 474 unrelated C282Y homozygotes. Associations were examined for both quantitative iron burden indices and clinical outcomes with 534,213 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) genotypes, with replication analyses in an independent sample of 748 C282Y homozygotes from four different European centres. One SNP met genome-wide statistical significance for association with transferrin concentration (rs3811647, GWAS p value of 7×10(-9) and replication p value of 5×10(-13)). This SNP, located within intron 11 of the TF gene, had a pleiotropic effect on serum iron (GWAS p value of 4.9×10(-6) and replication p value of 3.2×10(-6)). Both serum transferrin and iron levels were associated with serum ferritin levels, amount of iron removed and global clinical stage (p<0.01). Serum iron levels were also associated with fibrosis stage (p<0.0001). This GWAS, the largest one performed so far in unselected HFE-associated HH (HFE-HH) patients, identified the rs3811647 polymorphism in the TF gene as the only SNP significantly associated with iron metabolism through serum transferrin and iron levels. Because these two outcomes were clearly associated with the biochemical and clinical expression of the disease, an indirect link between the rs3811647 polymorphism and the phenotypic presentation of HFE-HH is likely.	25457201
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Meta analysis on relationship between distributions of C282Y and H63D alleles and genotypes and hepatocellular carcinoma.	Minerva medica	2016	1.24	According to the results of retrieving PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, this study summarized distributions of two commonly mutated alleles (C282Y and H63D) and genotypes in HFE gene, and considered odds ratios (ORs) as well as its 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) as effective variables of the included study itself and after summarizing. In terms of allele, compared with individual carrying wild type (WT) allele, individual carrying C282Y allele was more likely to suffer from liver cancer, with OR and P value of 1.58 (95% CI 1.10-2.27) and 0.01, respectively; no significantly increased risk of liver cancer was found in individual carrying H63D allele, with OR and P value of 1.12 (95% CI 0.89-1.47) and 0.35, respectively. From a perspective of genotype, in comparison with individual carrying WT/WT genotype, risk of individual carried with C282Y/C282Y homozygote genotype suffering from liver cancer increased significantly, with OR and P value of 5.10 (95% CI 2.58-10.09) and less than 0.00001, respectively. Furthermore, OR and P value of individual carrying C282Y/WT heterozygous genotype were 1.28 (95% CI 1.01-1.63) and 0.04 severally; and individual carried with H63D/H63D homozygote genotype was found without obviously increased liver cancer risk, with OR and P value of 1.04 (95% CI 0.63-1.71) and 0.89. Moreover, OR and P value of individual carrying H63D/H63D homozygote genotype or H63D/WT heterozygous genotype were 1.19 (95% CI 0.99-1.37) and 0.07, respectively. Meta analysis revealed that individual carrying C282Y/C282Y homozygote genotype had 5.10 times of liver cancer risk than individual carrying WT/WT genotype, while no significantly increased liver cancer risk was found in individual carrying H63D/H63D homozygote genotype or carrying C282Y/WT and H63D/WT heterozygous genotype.	26765307
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Predictors of haemoconcentration at delivery: association with low birth weight.	European journal of nutrition	2013	3.24	[corrected] To assess the factors associated with risk of haemoconcentration at delivery, such as initial haemoglobin levels and alterations in the HFE gene, and its effect on low birth weight in pregnant women supplemented with moderate doses of iron. Case-control study nested in a longitudinal study conducted on 217 healthy pregnant women taking moderate iron supplementation and their newborns. Women were classified according to the risk of haemoconcentration at delivery, defined as Hb > 130 g/L. Each subject's obstetric and clinical history, smoking habit, and iron biochemical parameters (haemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin and transferrin saturation) were recorded at 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester and at delivery. Polymorphisms of the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D and S65C) were also measured. The average of iron supplementation of all the women was 43.9 mg/dia (geometric mean, 95 % CI: 43.6-44.1). Higher levels of Hb at early gestation and the presence of HFE mutations were associated with greater risk of haemoconcentration at delivery, adjusted odds ratios of 1.14 (95 % CI: 1.05-1.25) and 5.35 (95 % CI: 1.6-17.8). Haemoconcentration at delivery was associated with a greater risk of low birth weight, adjusted odd ratio of 11.48 (95 % CI: 1.13-116.6). Moderate daily doses of supplementary iron may be harmful for foetal growth in women with alterations in HFE gene and who started pregnancy with good haemoglobin levels. Overall, this suggests the importance of determining a woman's iron status early in her pregnancy in order to establish a more appropriate pattern of supplementation.	23247927
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis (HFE) genotype and atherosclerosis: Increased susceptibility to iron-induced vascular damage in C282Y carriers?	Atherosclerosis	2010	3.94	The C282Y mutation of the hemochromatosis (HFE)-gene increases body iron status. Among Caucasians, the carrier frequency of this mutation is 8-9%. C282Y carriers may be more susceptible to iron-induced atherosclerosis due to higher iron levels. It has also been postulated that the C282Y mutation could alter aspects of iron metabolism. We examined the relationship between the C282Y mutation, iron status, and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) as a marker of atherosclerosis. The present study comprised 764 Dutch men and post-menopausal women aged 50-70 years. Mean and maximum carotid IMT were assessed by B-mode ultrasonography. Blood was sampled for assessment of the C282Y mutation and body iron status. Parameters of iron status (e.g. ferritin and non-transferrin bound iron) were significantly higher in C282Y carriers (n=80; 10%) compared to non-carriers (P-values <0.001), however, there was no difference in the carotid IMT measures. Among non-smokers (n=222), carotid IMT was 0.051 mm (95% CI: 0.005; 0.096) lower in carriers compared to non-carriers (P=0.03), which remained after adjustment for iron parameters. Within the subgroup of carriers, higher carotid IMT values were observed across sex-specific quartiles of ferritin (mean IMT: 0.789, 0.787, 0.814, and 0.865 mm; P-trend=0.08), whereas this association was absent in non-carriers. Overall, we found no association of HFE genotype with carotid IMT, despite higher iron status. Interestingly, C282Y carriers may be hyper responsive to vascular damage which needs to be confirmed in prospective cohort studies.	20400082
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Associations among behavior-related susceptibility factors in porphyria cutanea tarda.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2010	7.68	Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common of the human porphyrias and results from an acquired deficiency of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD). Some susceptibility factors have been identified; we examined associations among multiple factors in a large cohort of patients. Multiple known or suspected susceptibility factors and demographic and clinical features of 143 patients (mean age 52 years, 66% male, 88% Caucasian) with documented PCT (mean onset at 41 +/- 8.8 years) were tabulated; associations were examined by contingency tables, classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, and logistic regression. The most common susceptibility factors for PCT were ethanol use (87%), smoking (81%), chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (69%), and HFE mutations (53%; 6% C282Y/C282Y and 8% C282Y/H63D). Of those who underwent hepatic biopsy or ultrasound, 56% had evidence of hepatic steatosis. Of those with PCT, 66% of females took estrogen, 8% were diabetic, 13% had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and 17% had inherited uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) deficiency (determined by low erythrocyte UROD activity). Three or more susceptibility factors were identified in 70% of patients. HCV infection in patients with PCT was significantly associated with other behavior-related factors such as ethanol use (odds ratio [OR], 6.3) and smoking (OR, 11.9). Susceptibility factors for PCT were similar to previous studies; most patients had 3 or more susceptibility factors. Associations between PCT and HCV, ethanol or smoking could be accounted for by a history of multiple substance abuse; other factors are distributed more randomly among patients.	19948245

Netherlands heart journal : monthly journal of the Netherlands Society of Cardiology and the Netherlands Heart Foundation	2009	2.06	Haemochromatosis is a disturbance in the iron metabolism leading to excessive accumulation of iron in various organs such as the liver, pancreas, joints, skin, pituitary, testes and heart, with the last mentioned leading to heart failure. In this report we describe a patient with serious heart failure, attributed to homozygosity for C282Y in the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene, in whom repetitive phlebotomies led to normalisation of left ventricular function.

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	DNA-array of gene variants in venous leg ulcers: detection of prognostic indicators.	Journal of vascular surgery	2009	3.45	Wound healing in venous leg ulcer (VLU) is a multi-step process involving complex pathways. Scanty knowledge at molecular level hinders clinical assessment and treatment. Anomalous handling of local iron overload, as well as unbalancing in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and transglutaminase, has a recognized role in VLU establishment. We selected a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes (HFE, FPN1, MMP12, and FXIII) involved in VLU to identify potentially prognostic markers by means of DNA-array technology. The DNA-array-genotyping was assessed in 638 subjects for the following SNPs: HFE (C282Y, H63D), FPN1 (-8CG), MMP12 (-82AG) and FXIII (V34L). Of the subjects, 221 were affected by VLU (171 primary and 50 post-thrombosis), 112 by severe chronic venous disease (CVD) (CEAP, C3-C4), while 305 were matched healthy controls. The HFE and FXIII SNPs had been previously genotyped by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-methods on the same group of subjects (J Vasc Surg 2005;42:309; J Vasc Surg 2006;44:554; J Vasc Surg 2006;44:815). For the purpose of DNA-array, they were re-genotyped by means of array-techniques resulting in a 100% matching. Intergroup statistical comparisons were performed. In the risk computation, the FPN1 -8GG genotype had an overall CVD risk of 4.3 (95% CI, 1.6-12) and a VLU risk of 5.2 (95% CI, 1.9-15) virtually the same among primary VLU (4.98; 95% CI, 1.82-14.9). The MMP12-82AA genotype had a VLU risk of 1.96 (95% CI, 1.18-3.2) only in primary VLU (P = .01). In the genotype-ulcer size association studies, from a subgroup of 167 cases, we observed a smaller mean ulcer size in the MMP12 GG-genotype compared with the other genotypes (P = .001). Combining the present results with our previous published data on the same population, we suggest them to apply as tentative prognostic indicators in primary CVD. By analyzing simultaneously selected SNPs, it might be possible to glean precious information in predicting VLU onset or in stratifying patients according to their potential to heal. Although significant, our findings must be considered preliminary and the proposed prognostic indicators considered with caution, before ulterior more extensive studies in different populations can eventually confirm the present findings.	19958990
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE-Related Hemochromatosis: The Haptoglobin 2-2 Type Has a Significant but Limited Influence on Phenotypic Expression of the Predominant p.C282Y Homozygous Genotype.	Advances in hematology	2009	0.5	Phenotypic expression of the common p.C282Y/p.C282Y HFE-related hemochromatosis genotype is heterogeneous and depends on a complex interplay of genetic and non-genetic factors. Haptoglobin has a crucial role in free hemoglobin iron recovery, and exists as three major types: Hp1-1, Hp2-1 and Hp2-2. Hp2-2 favors endocytosis of hemoglobin iron in monocytes/macrophages, resulting in partial iron retention and increased intracellular ferritin levels. This situation is generally not expected to severely affect iron homeostasis, but was found to correlate with elevated serum iron indices in healthy men. Whether the Hp2-2 genotype acts as a modifier in HFE-related hemochromatosis is unclear. In this study we investigated influence of Hp2-2 and of potential confounders on the iron indices of 351 p.C282Y homozygous patients. We conclude that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the Hp2-2 genotype and increased iron indices in p.C282Y homozygous patients. The Hp2-2 effect is, however, limited and only apparent in males.	19960042
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Examining the clinical use of hemochromatosis genetic testing.	Canadian journal of gastroenterology & hepatology		0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis leads to an increased lifetime risk for end-organ damage due to excess iron deposition. Guidelines recommend that genetic testing be performed in patients with clinical suspicion of iron overload accompanied by elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels. To evaluate guideline adherence and the clinical and economic impact of HFE genetic testing. The electronic charts of patients submitted for HFE testing in 2012 were reviewed for genetic testing results, biochemical markers of iron overload and clinical history of phlebotomy. A total of 664 samples were sent for testing, with clinical, biochemical and phlebotomy data available for 160 patients. A positive C282Y homozygote or C282Y⁄H63D compound heterozygote test result was observed in 18% of patients. Patients with an at-risk HFE genotype had significantly higher iron saturation, serum iron and hemoglobin (P<0.001), without higher ferritin or liver enzyme levels. Fifty percent of patients referred for testing did not have biochemical evidence of iron overload (transferrin saturation >45% and ferritin level >300 μg⁄L). Patients were four times more likely to undergo phlebotomy if they were gene test positive (RR 4.29 [95% CI 2.35 to 7.83]; P<0.00001). One-half of patients referred for testing did not exhibit biochemical evidence of iron overload. Many patients with biochemical evidence of iron overload, but with negative genetic test results, did not undergo phlebotomy. A requisition to determine clinical indication for testing may reduce the use of the HFE genetic test. Finally, improvement of current genetic test characteristics would improve rationale for the test. A significant proportion of hemochromatosis genetic testing does not adhere to current guidelines and would not alter patient management.	25706573
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	An extensive analysis of the hereditary hemochromatosis gene HFE and neighboring histone genes: associations with childhood leukemia.	Annals of hematology	2010	3.02	The most common mutation of the HFE gene C282Y has shown a risk association with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Welsh and Scottish case-control studies. This finding has not been replicated outside Britain. Here, we present a thorough analysis of the HFE gene in a panel of HLA homozygous reference cell lines and in the original population sample from South Wales (117 childhood ALL cases and 414 newborn controls). The 21 of 24 variants analyzed were from the HFE gene region extending 52 kb from the histone gene HIST1H1C to HIST1H1T. We identified the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs807212 as a tagging SNP for the most common HFE region haplotype, which contains wild-type alleles of all HFE variants examined. This intergenic SNP rs807212 yielded a strong male-specific protective association (per allele OR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.22-0.64, P (trend) = 0.0002; P = 0.48 in females), which accounted for the original C282Y risk association. In the HapMap project data, rs807212 was in strong linkage disequilibrium with 25 other SNPs spanning 151 kb around HFE. Minor alleles of these 26 SNPs characterized the most common haplotype for the HFE region, which lacked all disease-associated HFE variants. The HapMap data suggested positive selection in this region even in populations where the HFE C282Y mutation is absent. These results have implications for the sex-specific associations observed in this region and suggest the inclusion of rs807212 in future studies of the HFE gene and the extended HLA class I region.	19806355
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Toll-like receptor 4 gene polymorphism modulates phenotypic expression in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis.	European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	2010	2.09	Clinical penetrance of hereditary hemochromatosis is highly variable. We hypothesized that it might be modified by factors involved in the cellular immune response, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) or nucleotide oligomerization domain proteins (NODs). Clinical expression of hemochromatosis was assessed as a function of TLR4, TLR9, and NOD2 polymorphisms in 99 homozygous carriers of the HFE C282Y mutation with mild-to-severe iron overload. Thirteen (13%) of the 99 hemochromatosis patients were heterozygous for a TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism and 86 (87%) were TLR4 wild-type-only carriers. Clinical expression of hemochromatosis was observed more frequently in carriers of the TLR4 polymorphism (100%) than in TLR4 wild-type carriers (56%, P = 0.002). This was based on higher prevalences of liver disease (92 vs. 45%, P = 0.002) and arthropathy of metacarpophalangeal joints (69 vs. 35%, P = 0.018) in TLR4 polymorphism carriers. The finding was strengthened by the strong association of TLR4 polymorphism with liver fibrosis in the subgroup of 52 patients who underwent a liver biopsy (P = 0.011). The TLR4 polymorphism did, however, not correlate with body iron overload. The study results remained significant in multiple regression analyses after excluding possible confounding effects, such as age, sex, alcohol, or meat intake, and in the subgroup of 84 patients presenting as the first members of their families. TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism modulates clinical expression in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. The polymorphism does not correlate with iron overload suggesting that TLR4 plays a role in an inflammatory process arising from toxic effects of iron accumulation.	19809335
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations in HFE causing hemochromatosis are associated with primary hypertriglyceridemia.	The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism	2009	0.5	Most cases of primary hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) are caused by the interaction of unknown polygenes and environmental factors. Elevated iron storage is associated with metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and obesity, and all of them are associated with HTG. The aim of the study was to analyze whether HFE mutations causing hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are associated with primary HTG. Genetic predisposition to HH was analyzed in a case-control study. The study was conducted at University Hospital Lipid Clinic. We studied two groups: 1) the HTG group, composed of 208 patients; and 2) the control group, composed of 215 normolipemic subjects and 161 familial hypercholesterolemia patients. Two HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) were analyzed. We measured HH genetic predisposition difference between groups. HH genetic predisposition was 5.9 and 4.4 times higher in the HTG group than in the normolipemic (P = 0.02) and FH (P = 0.05) subjects, respectively. There were 35 cases (16.8%) of iron overload in the primary HTG group, 14 (6.5%) and nine (5.6%) in the normolipidemic and FH groups, respectively. A higher HH genetic predisposition and a different prevalence of iron overload in subjects with HH genetic predisposition among groups contributed to this higher prevalence. None of the four cases with the HFE genotype associated with high risk of HH in the control groups presented iron overload; however, in eight of 11 subjects (72.7%) with primary HTG and HH genetic predisposition, the iron overload was present. Mutations in HFE gene, favoring iron overload and causing HH, could play an important role in the development of several phenotypes of primary HTG.	19820015
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) variants in a Jordanian Arab population and in diabetics from the same region.	Disease markers	2009	2.14	Hereditary HFE-linked hemochromatosis is a frequent recessive disorder among individuals of northern European ancestry. The clinical characteristic of this disease is the gradual accumulation of iron in internal organs, which ultimately may lead to organ damage and death. Three allelic variants of HFE gene have been correlated with hereditary hemochromatosis: C282Y is significantly associated with hereditary hemochromatosis in populations of Celtic origin, H63D and S65C are associated with milder form of iron overload. In this study we performed mutation analysis to identify allele frequency of the three variants of HFE gene in Jordanian Arab population, to assess deviations of these frequencies from those detected elsewhere, and to determine if there is an increased frequency of these variants in a diabetic population (Type 2 diabetes) from the same area. DNA was extracted from blood samples of 440 individuals attending King Abdullah University Hospital for ambulatory services. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify exons 2 and 4 of the HFE gene then restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method to detect the variants. There were neither homozygous nor heterozygous for C282Y variant. For the H63D variant, 0.68% were homozygous and 21.1% were heterozygous. For the S65C variant, there were no homozygous and 0.23% were heterozygous. Allelic frequencies were, 0%, 11.25%, and 0.11% for C282Y, H63D, and S65C, respectively. Our samples were subdivided into two categories of type 2 diabetic (89 cases) and controls (blood donors, 204 cases) and compared with regard to the H63D variant. Both groups did not have homozygous H63D variant. H63D heterozygous in diabetics were 23.60% and in blood donor controls 22.55%. Allelic frequency of the mutant H63D allele was 11.80% in diabetics and 11.27% for the blood donor controls. This is the first study to show the frequency of the three hemochromatosis gene variants in Jordan with the interesting finding of no C282Y allele detected in 440 samples. Additionally, no significant difference was observed in H63D variant frequency in type 2 diabetics as compared to controls.	19822954
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A novel association between a SNP in CYBRD1 and serum ferritin levels in a cohort study of HFE hereditary haemochromatosis.	British journal of haematology	2009	5.4	There is emerging evidence that there are genetic modifiers of iron indices for HFE gene mutation carriers at risk of hereditary hemochromatosis. A random sample, stratified by HFE genotype, of 863 from a cohort of 31 192 people of northern European descent provided blood samples for genotyping of 476 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 44 genes involved in iron metabolism. Single SNP association testing, using linear regression models adjusted for sex, menopause and HFE genotype, was conducted for four continuously distributed outcomes: serum ferritin (log transformed), transferrin saturation, serum transferrin, and serum iron. The SNP rs884409 in CYBRD1 is a novel modifier specific to HFE C282Y homozygotes. Median unadjusted serum ferritin concentration decreased from 1194 microg/l (N = 27) to 387 microg/l (N = 16) for male C282Y homozygotes and from 357 microg/l (N = 42) to 69 microg/l (N = 12) for females, comparing those with no copies to those with one copy of rs884409. Functional testing of this CYBRD1 promoter polymorphism using a heterologous expression assay resulted in a 30% decrease in basal promoter activity relative to the common genotype (P = 0.004). This putative genetic modifier of iron overload expression accounts for 11% (95% CI 0.4%, 22.6%) of the variance in serum ferritin levels of C282Y homozygotes.	19673882
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Simultaneous detection of HFE C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations associated with type 1 haemochromatosis using a multiplex luminex bead assay.	Tissue antigens	2011	2.05	Type 1 hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a common genetic disorder in Caucasoids resulting from mutations in the HFE gene. Routine diagnostic testing for type 1 HH involves genotyping for two of these described HFE mutations, C282Y and H63D. In some cases typing of a third mutation, S65C is also performed. Several techniques have been reported for HFE genotyping and these include polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-sequence-specific primers (SSP), PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), PCR-sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe (SSOP), real-time PCR followed by melting curve analysis and TaqMan assay. The aim of this study was to develop an alternative method to both conventional PCR and real-time PCR/TaqMan assay to detect all three HFE mutations in a single assay using Luminex technology. DNA controls of known genotypes (n = 109) were used to evaluate this approach. These controls were selected to represent the three possible genotypes (wild type, mutant, heterozygous) for each mutation. Subsequently, blind DNA samples (n = 100) were used to validate this method. This new assay was then compared with current techniques (in-house PCR-SSP and TaqMan assay). Comparison of genotypes obtained with the Luminex method with those previously reported by both in-house PCR-SSP and TaqMan assay showed 100% concordance for both DNA controls and blind DNA samples and no discrepancies were observed. Allelic frequency for C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations were 22%, 16% and 2%, respectively. We report here a high-throughput, accurate and robust multiplex luminex bead assay for routine clinical testing of C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in the HFE gene.	21736562

Transfusion medicine (Oxford, England)	2009	0.5	Limited data are available about iron deficiency (ID) in Brazilian blood donors. This study evaluated the frequencies of ID and iron-deficiency anaemia (IDA) separately and according to frequency of blood donations. The protective effect of the heterozygous genotype for HFE C282Y mutation against ID and IDA in female blood donors was also determined. Five hundred and eight blood donors were recruited at the Blood Bank of Santa Casa in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Haemoglobin and serum ferritin concentrations were measured. The genotype for HFE C282Y mutation was determined by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The ID was found in 21.1% of the women and 2.6% of the men whereas the IDA was found in 6.8 and 0.3%, respectively. The ID was found in 11.9% of the women in group 1 (first-time blood donors) and the frequency increased to 38.9% in women of the group 3 (blood donors donating once or more times in the last 12 months). No ID was found in men from group 1; however the ID frequency increased to 0.9% in group 2 (who had donated blood before but not in the last 12 months) and 5.0% in group 3. In summary, the heterozygous genotype was not associated with reduction of ID or IDA frequencies in both genders, but in male blood donors it was associated with a trend to elevated ferritin levels (P = 0.060). ID is most frequent in Brazilian women but was also found in men of group 3.	19747287
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of HFE and non-HFE gene mutations in Brazilian patients with hemochromatosis.	Clinics (Sao Paulo, Brazil)	2009	0.5	Approximately one-half of Brazilian patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are neither homozygous for the C282Y mutation nor compound heterozygous for the H63D and C282Y mutations that are associated with HH in Caucasians. Other mutations have been described in the HFE gene as well as in genes involved in iron metabolism, such as transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) and ferroportin 1 (SCL40A1). To evaluate the role of HFE, TfR2 and SCL40A1 mutations in Brazilian subjects with HH. Nineteen male subjects (median age 42 [range: 20-72] years) with HH were evaluated using the Haemochromatosis StripAssay A. This assay is capable of detecting twelve HFE mutations, which are V53M, V59M, H63D, H63H, S65C, Q127H, P160delC, E168Q, E168X, W169X, C282Y and Q283, four TfR2 mutations, which are E60X, M172K, Y250X, AVAQ594-597del, and two SCL40A1 mutations, which are N144H and V162del. In our cohort, nine (47%) patients were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, two (11%) were heterozygous for the H63D mutation, and one each (5%) was either heterozygous for C282Y or compound heterozygous for C282Y and H63D. No other mutations in the HFE, TfR2 or SCL40A1 genes were observed in the studied patients. One-third of Brazilian subjects with the classical phenotype of HH do not carry HFE or other mutations that are currently associated with the disease in Caucasians. This observation suggests a role for other yet unknown mutations in the aforementioned genes or in other genes involved in iron homeostasis in the pathogenesis of HH in Brazil.	19759876
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of H63D, S65C, and C282Y hereditary hemochromatosis gene variants in Madeira Island (Portugal).	Annals of hematology	2011	3.02	Hereditary HFE Hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism that results from mutations in the HFE gene. Almost all patients with hereditary hemochromatosis show a C282Y mutation in homozygosity or in compound heterozygosity with H63D. Also, the mutation S65C has been shown to be associated to a milder iron overload. Since allele and genotype frequencies of these three variants of the HFE gene vary between populations, the determination of their prevalence in Madeira Island will clarify the population susceptibility to hereditary hemochromatosis. One hundred and fifty-four samples from Madeira Island were genotyped for the three most common HFE gene mutations, H63D, C282Y, and S65C, by polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Results have shown a prevalence of 20.5%, 0.33%, and 1% for H63D, C282Y, and S65C, respectively. Accordingly to our estimates, both genotypes associated to hereditary hemochromatosis, C282Y homozygotes and C282/H63D compound heterozygotes, could be present in Madeira Island population in 1,648 individuals, which represents 0.65% of the total population.	20714725
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Longer survival associated with HLA-A*03, B*14 among 212 hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity and HLA-A and -B typing and haplotyping.	European journal of haematology	2010	2.54	Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes may influence iron phenotypes in patients with HFE hemochromatosis and could affect survival. We tabulated general characteristics of HLA-A and -B types and haplotypes of HFE C282Y/C282Y probands diagnosed in medical care and analyzed these data to identify HLA survival modifiers. There were 212 probands (130 men, 82 women). Mean follow-up was 12.0 ± 6.4 yr (0.1-41.2 yr; 34 deaths). HLA-A*03 was more prevalent in men (76.9% vs. 61.0% women; P = 0.0129); 35.4% of men and 29.3% of women had A*03, B*07; and 7.7% of men and 8.5% of women had A*03, B*14. Twenty-three probands had cirrhosis; none had A*03, B*14. Positivity for A*03 or A*03, B*07 was not a significant predictor or modifier of survival. In multiple regression analyses, A*03, B*14 predicted longer survival (P = 0.0004). Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed longer survival in probands with A*03, B*14 (P = 0.0199, log-rank test). After excluding the 23 non-A*03, B*14 probands with cirrhosis, survival of probands with A*03, B*14 was still greater than that of probands without A*03, B*14 (P = 0.0254; log-rank test). Twenty-four years after diagnosis, cumulative survival of probands with and without A*03, B*14 was 100% and 58%, respectively. The percentage of deaths due to iron overload was lower in probands with A*03, B*14 (0% vs. 21.9%; P = 0.0392). In hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y/C282Y, survival was longer in those with HLA-A*03, B*14. Earlier age at diagnosis and less severe iron overload in probands with A*03, B*14 could explain this difference.	20722701
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HLA haplotypes associated with hemochromatosis mutations in the Spanish population.	BMC medical genetics	2004	2.09	The present study is an analysis of the frequencies of HLA-A and -B antigens and HLA haplotypes in two groups of individuals homozygous for the two main HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) and a group heterozygous for the S65C mutation. The study population includes: 1123 healthy individuals, 100 homozygous for the C282Y mutation, 138 homozygous for the H63D mutation and 17 heterozygous for the S65C mutation. HFE and HLA alleles were detected using DNA-based and microlymphocytotoxicity techniques respectively. An expected significant association between C282Y and the HLA-A3/B7 haplotype was found, but other HLA haplotypes carrying the -A3 antigen were found: HLA-A3/B62 and HLA-A3/B44. Also, a significant association between H63D mutation and HLA-A29/B44 haplotype was found, and again other HLA haplotypes carrying the HLA-A29 antigen were also found: HLA-A29/B14 and HLA-A29/B62. In addition, the S65C mutation seems to be associated with a HLA haplotype carrying the HLA-A26 antigen. These findings clearly suggest that HLA-A3/B7 and HLA-A29/B44 are the ancestral haplotypes from which the C282Y and H63D mutations originated, respectively. The frequencies of these mutations in different populations, their geographical distribution, and the degree of the statistical association to the ancestral haplotypes, suggest that the H63D mutation must have occurred earlier than the C282Y mutation.	15498100
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Distribution of the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in hereditary hemochromatosis patients from the French Basque Country.	Annals of hematology	2005	3.02	The distribution of HFE mutations was studied in patients from the French Basque Country with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). The C282Y mutation was underrepresented but H63D seemed to demonstrate the highest prevalence when compared with other European countries. In addition, symptomatic HH was rarer in autochthonous Basques. This profile is interesting to consider in view of population genetics and should be associated with the search for non-HFE mutations.	15503019
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Liver dysfunction and steatosis in familial hypobetalipoproteinemia.	Clinical chemistry	2005	7.46	A 32-year-old man presented with increases in serum alanine aminotransferase activity, iron concentration, and transferrin saturation, suggestive of hepatic dysfunction and iron overload. In addition, he had unusually low plasma concentrations of LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein (apo) B. Hepatic ultrasonography was consistent with fatty liver. On liver biopsy, marked steatosis and moderate to marked iron deposition were observed. The patient was found to carry the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations, which are associated with hereditary hemochromatosis, and the alpha(1)-antitrypsin PiZ variant. An immunoblot of plasma for apoB showed the presence of a truncated apoB species, indicative of familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the patient was heterozygous for the apoB-80.5 (c.11040T>G) mutation. This unique case shows an unusual combination of underlying disorders that could all be contributing to liver dysfunction and fatty liver.	15514099
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of HFE gene mutations (C282Y, H63D, and S65C) in the Ecuadorian population.	Annals of hematology	2005	3.02	Type 1 hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron metabolism mostly related to the HFE gene mutations. In the present study, we performed a mutation analysis to determine the frequencies of the HFE gene mutations (C282Y, H63D, and S65C) in DNA samples of 100 healthy Ecuadorian individuals. We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify exons 2 and 4 of the HFE gene and then the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method to detect the mutations. The results revealed that the mutations in the normal Ecuadorian population have frequencies of 0.0, 0.035, and 0.04 for C282Y, H63D, and S65C, respectively. We also searched for these mutations in 12 hemochromatosis patients, and the frequencies that we found were 0.0 for C282Y, 0.167 for H63D, and 0.042 for S65C. We found differences [using the chi-square (chi2) test] in the frequency of the H63D mutation between the control group and the group of hemochromatosis patients (p<0.01). This suggests that in Ecuador, type 1 hemochromatosis is more influenced by the H63D mutation than the other two mutations that we analyzed. Given that in a Caucasian population hereditary hemochromatosis is mostly related to the C282Y mutation, it is possible that the findings for the Ecuadorian population are due to geographical differences between the populations.	15517265
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Predicting iron overload in hyperferritinemia.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2009	7.68	Hyperferritinemia is a common abnormality. This study determined the prevalence of hepatic iron overload in subjects of northern European origin with hyperferritinemia. Fifty-two consecutive subjects referred for evaluation of suspected iron overload (serum ferritin level >350 microg/L) were divided into 3 groups: group 1, increased transferrin saturation and no significant hemochromatosis gene product (HFE) mutations (N = 17); group 2, increased transferrin saturation and C282Y homozygosity or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity (N = 22); and group 3, normal transferrin saturation and no significant HFE mutations (N = 13). All subjects underwent magnetic resonance R2 relaxometry for quantitation of hepatic iron concentration (HIC). The HIC was significantly higher in group 2 subjects (123 +/- 22 micromol/g) compared with groups 1 and 3 subjects (39 +/- 4 and 36 +/- 5 micromol/g, respectively) (P < .01). Nine of 22 subjects in group 2 had an increase of their HIC to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal compared with none in the other 2 groups (P < .01). An increase of HIC to greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal is highly unlikely in hyperferritinemic subjects who do not have HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis or causes of secondary iron overload.	19095082
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron homeostasis and H63D mutations in alcoholics with and without liver disease.	World journal of gastroenterology	2009	2.79	To evaluate the prevalence of HFE gene mutation and indices of disturbed iron homeostasis in alcoholics with and without liver disease. One hundred and fifty-three heavy drinkers (defined as alcohol consumption > 80 g/d for at least 5 years) were included in the study. These comprised 78 patients with liver disease [liver disease alcoholics (LDA)] in whom the presence of liver disease was confirmed by liver biopsy or clinical evidence of hepatic decompensation, and 75 subjects with no evidence of liver disease, determined by normal liver tests on two occasions [non-liver disease alcoholics (NLDA)], were consecutively enrolled. Serum markers of iron status and HFE C282Y and H63D mutations were determined. HFE genotyping was compared with data obtained in healthy blood donors from the same geographical area. Gender ratio was similar in both study groups. LDA patients were older than NLDA patients (52 +/- 10 years vs 48 +/- 11 years, P = 0.03). One third and one fifth of the study population had serum transferrin saturation (TS) greater than 45% and 60% respectively. Serum iron levels were similar in both groups. However, LDA patients had higher TS (51 +/- 27 vs 36 +/- 13, P < 0.001) and ferritin levels (559 +/- 607 ng/mL vs 159 +/- 122 ng/mL, P < 0.001), and lower total iron binding capacity (TIBC) (241 +/- 88 microg/dL vs 279 +/- 40 microg/dL, P = 0.001). The odds ratio for having liver disease with TS greater than 45% was 2.20 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37-3.54). There was no difference in C282Y allelic frequency between the two groups. However, H63D was more frequent in LDA patients (0.25 vs 0.16, P = 0.03). LDA patients had a greater probability of carrying at least one HFE mutation than NLDA patients (49.5% vs 31.6%, P = 0.02). The odds ratio for LDA in patients with H63D mutation was 1.57 (95% CI: 1.02-2.40). The present study confirms the presence of iron overload in alcoholics, which was more severe in the subset of subjects with liver disease, in parallel with an increased frequency of H63D HFE mutation.	19115475
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Diagnosis of hepatic iron overload: a family study illustrating pitfalls in diagnosing hemochromatosis.	Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B	2009	1.47	Recent identification of genetic variants in iron storage disease has changed the classification system and diagnostic algorithms for hemochromatosis. Clinical diagnosis of the disease requires phenotypic evidence of iron overload because the commonly disease-associated HFE genotypes have an incomplete penetrance. Furthermore, approximately 20% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of hemochromatosis have no disease-associated genotype, which underlines the importance of clear phenotypic criteria of hemochromatosis. A diagnosis of hemochromatosis cannot be made even in patients with liver cirrhosis simply on the basis of genetic testing that indicates that iron overload is the cause of the disease and not its consequence. Proper diagnosis requires integration of clinical presentation, family history, and the results of biochemical and histopathologic tests. Here we propose a rational diagnostic algorithm for hepatic iron overload syndromes and illustrate potential pitfalls by presenting a family study in a pedigree with rare HFE variants (H63D and E168Q), in cis on the same chromosome. Although the clinical suspicion of hemochromatosis was confirmed by histology, chemical analysis of liver tissue revealed a normal hepatic iron concentration, which is compatible with the genetic finding of 1 normal and 1 doubly mutated allele. In conclusion, clinical suspicion of hemochromatosis and elevated serum iron parameters should prompt HFE genotyping for C282Y and H63D. Should they be uninformative, further genetic tests should be recommended only if iron overload in liver tissue has been confirmed chemically.	19214108
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha -308G>A allelic variant modulates iron accumulation in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis.	Clinical chemistry	2006	7.46	In vitro and animal studies suggest that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) modulates intestinal iron transport. We hypothesized that the effect of TNF-alpha might be particularly relevant if iron absorption is not effectively controlled by the HFE gene. In patients with homozygous C282Y hemochromatosis, we investigated the influence of TNF-alpha -308G>A allelic variant on total body iron overload, determined in all patients by measuring iron removed during depletion therapy, and hepatic iron index and need for phlebotomy to prevent iron reaccumulation, measured in patient subgroups. Of 86 patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, 16 (19%) were heterozygous carriers and 1 (1%) was a homozygous carrier of the TNF-alpha promoter -308A allele. Mean (SD) total body iron overload was increased 2-fold in TNF-alpha -308A allele carriers [10.9 (7.6) g] compared with homozygous carriers of the G allele [5.6 (5.0) g, P<0.001]. Hepatic iron index differed markedly between TNF-alpha -308A allele carriers [5.6 (3.5) micromol/g/year] and homozygous G allele carriers [3.1 (2.2) micromol/g/year, P=0.040, n=30]. After iron depletion, the need for phlebotomy to prevent iron reaccumulation (maintenance therapy) was substantially higher in TNF-alpha -308A allele carriers than in homozygous G allele carriers (P=0.014, n=73). We used multiple regression analyses to exclude possible confounding effects of sex, age, family screening, body-mass index, and meat or alcohol intake. TNF-alpha -308G>A allelic variant modulates iron accumulation in patients with hereditary (homozygous C282Y) hemochromatosis, but the effect of the TNF-alpha -308A allele on clinical manifestations of hemochromatosis was less accentuated than expected from the increased iron load associated with this allele.	16793930
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Liver diseases in the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening study.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2006	7.68	The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study screened 101,168 primary care participants for iron overload with serum transferrin saturation (TS), ferritin, and C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. All C282Y homozygotes and participants with an increased TS (>45% women, >50% men) and serum ferritin level (> 200 microg/L women, >300 microg/L men) were recalled for a clinical history and physical examination, and blood tests including alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase levels. Hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus were measured if the ALT level was increased (>31 IU/L in women, >40 IU/L in men). In the group of participants selected to return for clinical examination because of increased TS and ferritin levels, ALT increases and anti-hepatitis C virus were found in 95 of 284 (33%) African Americans, 50 of 466 (11%) Asian and Pacific Islanders, 21 of 120 (18%) Hispanics, and 40 of 477 (8.4%) Caucasians. ALT increases and hepatitis B surface antigen were detected in 24 of 466 (5%) Asian and Pacific Islanders, 10 of 284 (3.5%) African Americans, 3 of 120 (2.5%) Hispanics, and 2 of 477 (.42%) Caucasians. Of 86 liver biopsy specimens obtained for clinical purposes, 53 were reviewed by a single study pathologist. Liver fibrosis (stage 3 or 4) was present in 2 of 11 (18.2%) C282Y homozygotes that underwent central review and 2 of 302 (.66%) C282Y homozygotes attending the clinical examination. Screening for iron overload with ferritin and TS detects persons with viral hepatitis and other types of liver disease. A minimum of .66% C282Y homozygotes have liver fibrosis.	16797244
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Molecular analysis of A1AT (S and Z) and HFE (C282Y and H63D) gene mutations in Egyptian cases with HCV liver cirrhosis.	Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD	2006	1.89	Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) S and Z deficiency alleles and hemochromatosis (HFE) mutant C282Y, H63D alleles were reported to potentially affect the liver even if present in a heterozygous state. This is a cross-sectional, randomized, case controlled study for evaluation of the frequency of these alleles in Egyptian patients with HCV liver cirrhosis and of their association with the disease. This study included 48 cases with viral C cirrhosis recruited from the Hepatology Unit, Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt, and 70 unrelated healthy controls. PCR amplification of relevant gene segment followed by restriction enzyme digestion Taq1 for detection of A1AT gene S and Z alleles, digestion with Rsa I and Bcl I for HFE gene C282Y and H63D alleles. These alleles were then characterized through analysis of resulting restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Both heterozygous (MS) and homozygous (SS) genotypes were significantly more frequent in cases than in controls ( P<0.05, RR= 2.23 and 2.17 respectively). Gene frequency of S allele was higher in cases than controls (P<0.05, RR=2.17). Homozygosity (ZZ) genotype, present only in cases (6.3% vs 0.0% in controls,) did not reach statistical significance. HFE gene heterozygosity for H63D allele was detected in 20.0% of cases and 21.4% of controls, whereas C282Y allele was detected neither among cases nor in controls. The presence of the relatively high frequency of A1AT S and HFE H63D allele carriers in Egyptian cases of HCV liver cirrhosis suggest the necessity to implement routine molecular analysis of these genes for detection of risk genotypes among affected families.	16802007
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.	Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)	2006	0.5	Dilated cardiomyopathy is a typical complication of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). The present study investigated, whether mutations of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene might be etiologic and disease-modifying factors in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy Clinical and biochemical assessment and HFE gene analysis were perfomed in 46 patients with IDCM and 350 healthy controls. Cardiomyopathy was angiographically defined according to the criteria of the Collaborative Research Group of the European Human and Capital Mobility Project of Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy. A higher prevalence of C282Y homozygosity was found among patients with IDCM compared to healthy subjects (4.3% vs. 0.6%; p < 0.02). A total of 6.5% of the patients with IDCM were either C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes. The C282Y allele frequency was somewhat higher among patients with IDCM (8.7%) compared to healthy controls (5.4%; p < 0.2), whereas the H63D allele frequency was not increased. No significant differences of serum iron, ferritin or transferrin saturation, cardiac iron loading, NYHA classification, Lown's classification, the history of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, LVEDD (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter), EF (ejection fraction), LADD (left atrial end-diastolic diameter) and CI (cardiac index) were seen between HFE carriers and noncarriers. The present study indicates that it is worth screening patients with IDCM for iron parameters given the increased prevalence of disease-predisposing HFE constellations. It remains unclear, to what extent iron or immune-mediated processes contribute to the pathomechanism of IDCM.	16802538
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Recent advances in hemochromatosis: a 2015 update : a summary of proceedings of the 2014 conference held under the auspices of Hemochromatosis Australia.	Hepatology international	2015	1.12	This review focuses on iron metabolism, the genetics of hemochromatosis, current treatment protocols and various screening methods. Even though the most common form of hereditary hemochromatosis, C282Y gene mutations in the HFE gene, has been extensively studied, novel mutations in both HFE and non-HFE genes have been implicated in this disease. These have important implications for the Asia-Pacific region. In overload, deposition of iron in various body tissues leads to toxic damage. Patients commonly present with non-specific symptoms of malaise and lethargy. Biochemical, imaging and genetic testing can be carried out to confirm diagnosis. Venesection forms the mainstay of treatment and at present cascade screening of affected families is recommended over population-level screening.	25788196
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Sudden sensorineural hearing loss and polymorphisms in iron homeostasis genes: new insights from a case-control study.	BioMed research international	2015	2.13	Background. Even if various pathophysiological events have been proposed as explanations, the putative cause of sudden hearing loss remains unclear. Objectives. To investigate and to reveal associations (if any) between the main iron-related gene variants and idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Study Design. Case-control study. Materials and Methods. A total of 200 sudden sensorineural hearing loss patients (median age 63.65 years; range 10-92) were compared with 400 healthy control subjects. The following genetic variants were investigated: the polymorphism c.-8CG in the promoter of the ferroportin gene (FPN1; SLC40A1), the two isoforms C1 and C2 (p.P570S) of the transferrin protein (TF), the amino acidic substitutions p.H63D and p.C282Y in the hereditary hemochromatosis protein (HFE), and the polymorphism c.-582AG in the promoter of the HEPC gene, which encodes the protein hepcidin (HAMP). Results. The homozygous genotype c.-8GG of the SLC40A1 gene revealed an OR for ISSNHL risk of 4.27 (CI 95%, 2.65-6.89; P = 0.001), being overrepresented among cases. Conclusions. Our study indicates that the homozygous genotype FPN1 -8GG was significantly associated with increased risk of developing sudden hearing loss. These findings suggest new research should be conducted in the field of iron homeostasis in the inner ear.	25789325
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Wilson's disease and hemochromatosis.	Adolescent medicine clinics	2004	0.5	Wilson's disease (WD) and hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are two inherited disorders with potentially devastating and life-threatening complications. Their eminent treatability makes diagnosis in adolescence or young adulthood critical. WD is the result of abnormal copper homeostasis, causing copper overload and end-organ damage. Chelation therapy can be highly efficacious in preventing manifestations of WD. HH is caused by inappropriate absorption of dietary iron, typically as the result of a specific mutation, C282Y, in the HFE gene. End-organ disease from iron accumulation is protean and includes progressive damage of the liver, pancreas, skin, heart, and pituitary. It is important to permit therapeutic phlebotomy to commence before the onset of complications.	15272264
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations in the hereditary haemochromatosis gene HFE in professional endurance athletes.	British journal of sports medicine	2004	6.72	Hereditary haemochromatosis, a disease that affects iron metabolism, progresses with a greater or lesser tendency to induce iron overload, possibly leading to severe organ dysfunction. Most elite endurance athletes take iron supplements during their active sporting life, which could aggravate this condition. To determine the prevalence and discuss potential clinical implications of mutations of HFE (the gene responsible for hereditary haemochromatosis) in endurance athletes. Basal concentrations of iron, ferritin, and transferrin and transferrin saturation were determined in the period before competition in 65 highly trained athletes. Possible mutations in the HFE gene were evaluated in each subject by extracting genomic DNA from peripheral blood. The restriction enzymes SnaBI and BclI were used to detect the mutations 845G-->A (C282Y) and 187C-->G (H63D). Our findings indicate a high prevalence of HFE gene mutations in this population (49.2%) compared with sedentary controls (33.5%). No association was detected in the athletes between mutations and blood iron markers. The findings support the need to assess regularly iron stores in elite endurance athletes.	15273174

Polymerase chain reaction analysis of peripheral blood for hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations is available for clinical use. Early detection and treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis limit disease progression and improve life expectancy. We present 8 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda subsequently found to have hereditary hemochromatosis or mutations in the HFE gene. Retrospective review of patients in whom both porphyria cutanea tarda and hereditary hemochromatosis or HFE gene mutations were diagnosed between 1976 and 2000. Eight patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (6 males, 2 females; age range, 4-60 years; mean age at diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda, 42 years) were subsequently found to have hepatic iron overload or HFE gene mutations. Two patients had liver biopsy findings compatible with homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis. In the other 6 patients, HFE gene analysis revealed 3 homozygous C282Y, 1 compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D, and 2 heterozygous C282Y mutations. Seven patients (88%) had no specific signs or symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis at diagnosis. In 5 patients (63%), the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis or HFE gene mutation was initially suspected by the dermatologist. Porphyria cutanea tarda can be an important cutaneous marker for patients with mutations of the HFE gene. HFE gene analysis should be done in patients who present with porphyria cutanea tarda. The dermatologist may play a key role in the early diagnosis of subclinical hereditary hemochromatosis in patients who present with porphyria cutanea tarda.	15280838
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Common heterozygous hemochromatosis gene mutations are risk factors for inflammation and fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2004	4.47	Chronic hepatitis C is frequently associated with increased hepatic iron stores. It remains controversial whether heterozygous mutations of hemochromatosis genes affect fibrosis progression. Therefore our aim was to assess associations between HFE mutations and hepatic inflammation and stage of fibrosis in German hepatitis C patients. Liver biopsies from 166 patients were scored for inflammatory activity (A0-4) and hepatic fibrosis (F0-4). Gene mutations were determined by LightCycler, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, or direct sequencing. The frequencies of common HFE mutations C282Y and H63D are 4.2% and 21.3%, whereas the recently described S65C substitution and the Y250X mutation in the transferrin receptor 2 gene are very rare. In regression analysis, heterozygous carriers of C282Y or H63D mutations display significantly (P < 0.05) higher inflammatory activities and more advanced fibrosis than patients without mutations. For C282Y heterozygous patients, the odds ratios for marked inflammatory activity (A2-4) and advanced liver fibrosis or cirrhosis (F2-4) are 4.9 and 4.6, respectively, compared with patients carrying homozygous wild-type alleles. C282Y mutations are associated with significantly (P < 0.05) increased serum iron and aminotransferase levels, whereas H63D heterozygotes display higher transferrin saturation, serum iron, and ferritin concentrations compared to wild-type (P < 0.01). Common heterozygous hemochromatosis mutations are associated with higher grades of inflammation and more severe hepatic fibrosis. Our findings support a role of HFE mutations as primary risk factors for fibrogenesis and disease progression in chronic hepatitis C.	15287851
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The origin and spread of the HFE-C282Y haemochromatosis mutation.	Human genetics	2004	5.14	"""The mutation responsible for most cases of genetic haemochromatosis in Europe (HFE C282Y) appears to have been originated as a unique event on a chromosome carrying HLA-A3 and -B7. It is often described as a """"Celtic mutation""""--originating in a Celtic population in central Europe and spreading west and north by population movement. It has also been suggested that Viking migrations were largely responsible for the distribution of this mutation. Two, initial estimates of the age of the mutation are compatible with either of these suggestions. Here we examine the evidence about HFE C282Y frequencies, extended haplotypes involving HLA-A and -B alleles, the validity of calculations of mutation age, selective advantage and current views on the relative importance of """"demic-diffusion"""" (population migration) and """"adoption-diffusion"""" (cultural change) in the neolithic transition in Europe and since then. We conclude that the HFE C282Y mutation occurred in mainland Europe before 4,000 BC."""	15290237
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Typical type 2 diabetes mellitus and HFE gene mutations: a population-based case - control study.	Human molecular genetics	2003	5.99	Diabetes mellitus is a recognized consequence of hereditary haemochromatosis. Whether the common HFE mutations, that associate with this condition and pre-dispose to increases in serum iron indices, are over-represented in diabetic populations remains controversial. We present data from the largest case-control study of the C282Y and H63D HFE allele frequencies in typical type 2 diabetes mellitus, as defined by an age of onset greater than 30 years and no requirement for insulin in the first year post-diagnosis. We also present a meta-analysis of all similar studies to date. We see no evidence for over-representation of iron loading HFE alleles in type 2 diabetes mellitus, suggesting that screening for HFE mutations in this population is of no value.	12783844
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Evidence that the Cys282Tyr mutation of the HFE gene originated from a population in Southern Scandinavia and spread with the Vikings.	Clinical genetics	2003	3.89	Hereditary hemochromatosis has been recognized as a clinical disorder for more than 100 years. The common form of the disorder is caused by the Cys282Tyr mutation (C282Y) of the HFE gene. Hereditary hemochromatosis affects predominantly people of Northern European origin. The C282Y mutation probably occurred on a single chromosome carrying the ancestral hemochromatosis haplotype, which subsequently was spread by emigration and the founder effect. It has been estimated that the C282Y mutation appeared 60-70 generations ago. It was initially suggested that the ancestral C282Y mutation occurred within the Celtic group of peoples. However, we hypothesize that the distribution of the C282Y mutation in Europe is more consistent with an origin among the Germanic Iron Age population in Southern Scandinavia. From this area, the mutation could later be spread by the migratory activities of the Vikings. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the validity of these two hypotheses. Several arguments are in favor of the 'Viking hypothesis': first, the highest frequencies (5.1-9.7%) of the C282Y mutation are observed in populations in the Northern part of Europe, i.e. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Faeroe Islands, Iceland, Eastern part of England (Danelaw) and the Dublin area, all Viking homelands and settlements. Second, the highest allele frequencies are reported among populations living along the coastlines. Third, the frequencies of the C282Y mutation decline from Northern to Southern Europe. Intermediate allele frequencies (3.1-4.8%) are seen in the populations in Central Europe, which is the original Celtic homeland. Low allele frequencies (0-3.1%) are recognized in populations in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean.	12791037
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Expression of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene modulates the cellular uptake of 67Ga.	Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine	2003	5.85	Recent studies have revealed that the wild-type hemochromatosis protein (HFE) interacts with the transferrin receptor (TfR) and modulates TfR-mediated iron uptake by cells. Because of similarities in the transport of gallium and iron and the use of (67)Ga scanning in lymphoid malignancies, we examined the effect of HFE expression on (67)Ga uptake. (67)Ga and (59)Fe uptakes were measured in HeLa cells transfected with a FLAG-tagged wild-type HFE (fHFE) gene under control of a tetracycline-repressible promoter. fHFE and TfR protein levels were measured by Western blotting; cellular transferrin (Tf) binding sites were measured by (125)I-Tf binding assay. Induction of fHFE expression produced an increase in TfR protein that was accompanied by a decrease, rather than an increase, in cellular (67)Ga and (59)Fe uptake. The difference in (67)Ga uptake between fHFE-expressing and fHFE-nonexpressing cells was markedly increased in the presence of Tf. Although fHFE expression produced an increase in cellular TfR protein, cell surface and intracellular Tf binding sites were actually decreased in these cells. Our studies suggest that expression of wild-type HFE in cells produces a decrease in (67)Ga uptake due to a reduction in available Tf binding sites for (67)Ga-Tf on the TfR. These results imply that (67)Ga uptake by cells with wild-type HFE may differ from cells with the HFE C282Y mutation.	12791823
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Lack of evidence for the pathogenic role of iron and HFE gene mutations in Brazilian patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.	Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas	2003	0.5	The hypothesis of the role of iron overload associated with HFE gene mutations in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been raised in recent years. In the present study, biochemical and histopathological evidence of iron overload and HFE mutations was investigated in NASH patients. Thirty-two NASH patients, 19 females (59%), average 49.2 years, 72% Caucasians, 12% Mulattoes and 12% Asians, were submitted to serum aminotransferase and iron profile determinations. Liver biopsies were analyzed for necroinflammatory activity, architectural damage and iron deposition. In 31 of the patients, C282Y and H63D mutations were tested by PCR-RFLP. Alanine aminotransferase levels were increased in 30 patients, 2.42 1.12 times the upper normal limit on average. Serum iron concentration, transferrin saturation and ferritin averages were 99.4 31.3 g/dl, 33.1 12.7% and 219.8 163.8 g/dl, respectively, corresponding to normal values in 93.5, 68.7 and 78.1% of the patients. Hepatic siderosis was observed in three patients and was not associated with architectural damage (P = 0.53) or with necroinflammatory activity (P = 0.27). The allelic frequencies (N = 31) found were 1.6 and 14.1% for C282Y and H63D, respectively, which were compatible with those described for the local population. In conclusion, no evidence of an association of hepatic iron overload and HFE mutations with NASH was found. Brazilian NASH patients comprise a heterogeneous group with many associated conditions such as hyperinsulinism, environmental hepatotoxin exposure and drugs, but not hepatic iron overload, and their disease susceptibility could be related to genetic and environmental features other than HFE mutations.	12792703
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Duodenal expression of iron transport molecules in untreated haemochromatosis subjects.	Gut	2003	14.92	In HFE associated hereditary haemochromatosis, the duodenal enterocyte behaves as if iron deficient and previous reports have shown increased duodenal expression of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and iron regulated gene 1 (Ireg1) in affected subjects. In those studies, many patients had undergone venesection, which is a potent stimulus of iron absorption. Our study investigated duodenal expression of DMT1 (IRE and non-IRE), Ireg1, hephaestin, and duodenal cytochrome-b (Dyctb) in untreated C282Y homozygous haemochromatosis patients, iron deficient patients, and iron replete subjects. Total RNA was extracted from duodenal biopsies and expression of the iron transport genes was assessed by ribonuclease protection assay. Expression of DMT1 (IRE) and Ireg1 was increased 3-5-fold in iron deficient subjects compared with iron replete subjects. Duodenal expression of DMT1 (IRE) and Ireg1 was similar in haemochromatosis patients and iron replete subjects but in haemochromatosis patients with elevated serum ferritin concentrations, both DMT1 (IRE) and Ireg1 expression were inappropriately increased relative to serum ferritin concentration. Hephaestin and Dcytb levels were not upregulated in haemochromatosis. DMT1 (IRE) and Ireg1 levels showed significant inverse correlations with serum ferritin concentration in each group of patients. These findings are consistent with DMT1 (IRE) and Ireg1 playing primary roles in the adaptive response to iron deficiency. Untreated haemochromatosis patients showed inappropriate increases in DMT1 (IRE) and Ireg1 expression for a given level of serum ferritin concentration, although the actual level of expression of these iron transport genes was not significantly different from that of normal subjects.	12801950
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	AVAQ 594-597 deletion of the TfR2 gene in a Japanese family with hemochromatosis.	Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology	2003	2.21	The majority of Caucasian patients with hemochromatosis are homozygous for C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. In contrast to its high prevalence in Caucasians, hemochromatosis is a rare disorder in Japan. This may be due to the low prevalence of the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in Japanese. Recent reports suggest that the mutations of transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) gene may be involved in non-HFE hemochromatosis. Therefore, we investigated the TfR2 gene of 6 sporadic and 5 familiar cases of Japanese hemochromatosis. Three siblings in one family were found to be homozygous for an AVAQ 594-597 deletion. All three had severe iron deposits in the hepatocytes and bile ducts, but none was affected by diabetes mellitus. This mutation was not detected in 100 control individuals. Further study was undertaken to investigate whether the large deletion of the TfR2 gene is the mutation responsible for some of the Japanese hemochromatosis cases.	12809944
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A prospective study of coronary heart disease and the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) C282Y mutation: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.	Atherosclerosis	2001	3.94	Increased iron stores may play a role in the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) by increasing lipoprotein oxidation. Recently, mutations have been discovered in the gene (HFE) for hereditary hemochromatosis, an autosomal recessive condition of disordered iron metabolism, absorption, and storage. It is possible that people who carry HFE mutations have increased risk of CHD. We used a prospective case-cohort design (243 CHD cases and 535 non-cases) to determine whether the HFE C282Y mutation was associated with incident CHD in a population-based sample of middle-aged men and women. The frequencies of homozygosity and heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the ARIC study population were 0.2% (one homozygous person) and 6%, respectively. The C282Y mutation was associated with nonsignificantly increased risk of CHD (relative risk=1.60, 95% CI 0.9-2.9). After adjusting for other confounding risk factors (age, race, gender, ARIC community, smoking status, diabetes status, hypertension status, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides), the association became stronger (relative risk=2.70, 95% CI 1.2-6.1). However, a sensitivity analysis showed that this estimate of relative risk was somewhat unstable due to few subjects in some strata. Our prospective findings suggest that individuals carrying the HFE C282Y mutation may be at increased risk of CHD.	11257277
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetics of iron storage and hemochromatosis.	Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals	2001	3.21	The regulation of total body iron is important to all organisms. In mammals, the iron content of the body is controlled almost entirely through regulation of absorption. The precise mechanism by which iron is absorbed and the manner in which the absorption is regulated is unknown, but a number of different proteins that are involved either in the transport process itself or its regulation have been identified. These include HFE, a class 1 HLA molecule involved in hereditary hemochromatosis, the divalent metal transporter (DMT-1), hephaestin, the transferrin receptor, and mobilferrin. Iron overload occurs in a number of hereditary disorders including atransferrinemia, aceruloplasminemia, X-linked hereditary sideroblastic anemia, thalassemia major, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia, and various red cell enzyme deficiencies. In Europeans, most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis are due to mutations of the HFE gene. There are two major mutations of this gene c.845G-->A (C282Y) and c.187C-->G (H63D). These mutations have extraordinarily high prevalence in northern Europe and approximately five in a thousand Europeans are homozygous for the 845A mutation. The penetrance of even the homozygous state for the 845A mutation is very low and that for the compound heterozygote 845A/187G, which is also associated with hemochromatosis, is even lower. The reason for the markedly variable penetrance that exists in this disorder remains unknown.	11259339
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations and transferrin receptor polymorphism analysis in porphyria cutanea tarda: a prospective study of 36 cases from southern France.	The British journal of dermatology	2001	0.5	Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is associated in most cases with iron overload, which may participate in decreased activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase in the liver. The aetiology of this iron overload remains unknown; however, it has been demonstrated that mutations of HFE, the genetic haemochromatosis gene, might be present in a significant proportion of Anglo-Saxon and Italian patients. Furthermore, transferrin receptor polymorphism may influence the affinity of this receptor to its ligand with a subsequent increase of cellular iron absorption and storage. To evaluate the incidence and spectrum of HFE mutations and the relative frequency of the two main alleles of transferrin receptor in patients with PCT originating from southern France, and to evaluate the relationship of these genetic data with iron status, and with hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Thirty-six consecutive patients with either sporadic or familial PCT were prospectively included between 1997 and 2000. Search for the presence of the three main mutations of the HFE gene and identification of the transferrin receptor alleles were performed using polymerase chain reaction followed by enzymatic digestion. Iron parameters and viral status for hepatitis B and C viruses and HIV were determined. Seven patients (19%) showed heterozygous C282Y mutation, but no C282Y homozygote was present; five patients (14%) carried homozygous H63D mutation, while eight (22%) were heterozygous for this mutation. One patient was heterozygous for the S65C mutation (3%). Iron parameters demonstrated overload in all patients, without a clear difference between patients with and without deleterious mutations of the HFE gene. Infection by hepatitis C virus was documented in 20 patients (56%), and was significantly less frequent in patients with deleterious HFE mutations. The profile of transferrin receptor alleles in PCT patients did not show significant variation compared with the general population. This study confirms the high frequency of HFE mutations in patients with PCT and supports the hypothesis that HFE gene abnormalities might play a significant part in the PCT pathomechanism, probably through iron overload; by contrast, transferrin receptor polymorphisms do not appear to play a significant part in iron overload in PCT.	11260010
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Compound heterozygosity for haemochromatosis gene mutations and hepatic iron overload in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients.	Pathology	2001	2.97	Iron overload has been proposed as a cause of liver dysfunction after BMT Factors which could be relevant to iron overload include the number of red cell transfusions and mutations within the haemochromatosis gene (HFE). Two point mutations, Cys282Tyr and His63Asp, have been described within HFE. Cys282Tyr homozygosity is associated with haemochromatosis; the effect of compound heterozygosity, Cys282Tyr/His63Asp, on iron status is variable. We analysed HFE status in 52 allograft patients surviving more than 6 months. Compound heterozygosity was identified in three patients (Cases 1-3). Iron status and liver function were evaluated and, in Cases 1 and 2, liver histology and iron content as well. Case 3 who received 12 units of red cells had a normal ferritin and liver function. Cases 1 and 2 received 29 and 59 units, respectively, and had high serum ferritins and transferrin saturations, abnormal liver function and significant hepatic iron overload on biopsy. Iron overload in Case 1 patient progressed in the context of GVHD and in the absence of further transfusion, suggesting that liver GVHD may increase hepatic iron accumulation. These cases demonstrate the variable phenotypic expression of HFE compound heterozygosity in BMT recipients, which may be only partly explained by transfusional iron loading. Venesection or chelation therapy should be considered in patients with coexistent hepatic GVHD and iron overload.	11280607
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association of mutations in the hemochromatosis gene with shorter life expectancy.	Archives of internal medicine	2001	0.5	To investigate whether the frequency of carriers of mutations in the HFE gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis diminishes with age as an indication that HFE mutations are associated with increased mortality. It is of value in the debate concerning screening for hereditary hemochromatosis to determine the significance of heterozygosity. Genotyping for mutations in exons 2 and 4 of the HFE gene using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in 1784 participants aged 45 to 100 years from 4 population-based studies: all 183 centenarians from the Danish Centenarian Study, 601 people aged 92 to 93 years from the Danish 1905 Cohort, 400 aged 70 to 94 years from the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins, and 600 aged 45 to 67 years from a study of middle-aged Danish twins. All participants (N=1784) were screened for mutations in exon 4, and a trend toward fewer heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation-the mutation most often associated with hereditary hemochromatosis-was found. This was significant for the whole population (P=.005) and for women (P=.004) but not for men (P=.26). A group of 599 participants was screened for mutations in exon 2, and there was no variation in the distribution of mutations in exon 2 in the different age groups. In a high-carrier frequency population like Denmark, mutations in HFE show an age-related reduction in the frequency of heterozygotes for C282Y, which suggests that carrier status is associated with shorter life expectancy.	11700156
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary haemochromatosis: detection and management.	The Medical journal of Australia	2001	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis is common, affecting one in 200 Australians of Anglo-Celtic descent; it results in iron overload affecting many organs, including the liver, heart, endocrine and musculoskeletal system. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, as presenting symptoms and signs may be non-specific. Once suspected, hereditary haemochromatosis can be readily diagnosed by measurement of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin level, followed by genetic assessment. Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene accounts for most cases in people of Anglo-Celtic descent in Australia; a genetic test for this mutation is widely available. Liver biopsy is advocated only in selected individuals at risk of cirrhosis or with an unclear diagnosis. Therapeutic phlebotomy remains the treatment and, if instituted early, will prevent many of the organ-specific complications.	11700835
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical and genetic heterogeneity in hereditary haemochromatosis: association between lymphocyte counts and expression of iron overload.	European journal of haematology	2001	2.54	To identify a new marker of expression of disease, independent of HFE genotype in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HHC), the total peripheral blood lymphocyte counts were analysed according to iron status in two groups of subjects with HFE mutations. The groups consisted of 38 homozygotes for C282Y, and 107 heterozygotes for the C282Y or compound heterozygotes for C282Y and H63D. For control purposes, total lymphocyte counts and iron status were also examined in 20 index patients with African dietary iron overload, a condition not associated with HFE mutations, and in 144 members of their families and communities. Mean lymphocyte numbers were lower in C282Y homozygous HHC index subjects with cirrhosis and higher iron stores than in those without cirrhosis and with lower iron burdens [(1.65 +/- 0.43) x 10(6)/mL vs. (2.27 +/- 0.49) x 10(6)/mL; p = 0.008]. Similarly, mean lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in C282Y heterozygotes and C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes with iron overload and increased serum ferritin concentrations compared to those with normal serum ferritin concentrations (p < 0.05). Statistically significant negative correlations were found, in males, between lymphocyte counts and the total body iron stores, either in C282Y homozygous HHC patients (p = 0.031 in a multiple regression model dependent on age) and in C282Y heterozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes with iron overload (p = 0.029 in a simple linear model). In contrast, lymphocyte counts increased with increasing serum ferritin concentrations among the index subjects with African iron overload (r = 0.324, not statistically significant) and among the members of their families and communities (r = 0.170, p = 0.042). These results suggest that a lower peripheral blood lymphocyte count is associated with a greater degree of iron loading in HFE haemochromatosis but not in African iron overload, and they support the notion that the lymphocyte count may serve as a marker of a non-HFE gene that influences the clinical expression of HFE haemochromatosis.	11722599
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Blood donors with hereditary hemochromatosis.	Transfusion	2010	3.04	The distribution of C282Y and H63D variants of the HFE gene was determined in donors with evidence of phenotypical hemochromatosis. The ferritin level and the effect of a donation on iron status in the different HFE genotypes were studied. Forty women and 107 men with hemochromatosis were compared to HFE wild-type donors. The influence of a blood donation was assessed by the change in ferritin between two consecutive donations. In women and men, 85 and 59%, respectively, were C282Y homozygote. None of the women had H63D alleles. There was no significant difference in the donation history or the ferritin level between the HFE genotypes. Donation frequencies were, respectively, 3.3 and 3.7 per year for women and men. The ferritin level was significantly higher in women with hemochromatosis, while in men it was similar compared to the respective wild types. The negative influence of a donation on iron status was similar in hemochromatotic and wild-type women, while men with hemochromatosis were significantly less vulnerable to a blood donation than genetically wild-type men. Subjects with hemochromatosis are valuable as blood donors independent of their HFE genotype. In general, the ferritin level tended to be higher in those with hemochromatosis than in wild types. The negative influence of a blood donation on iron status was less in male donors with hemochromatosis than in wild types.	20345568
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HLA haplotype map of river valley populations with hemochromatosis traced through five centuries in Central Sweden.	European journal of haematology	2008	2.54	The hemochromatosis mutation, C282Y of the HFE gene, seems to have originated from a single event which once occurred in a person living in the north west of Europe carrying human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A3-B7. In descendants of this ancestor also other haplotypes appear probably caused by local recombinations and founder effects. The background of these associations is unknown. Isolated river valley populations may be fruitful for the mapping of genetic disorders such as hemochromatosis. In this study, we try to test this hypothesis in a study from central Sweden where the haplotyope A1-B8 was common. HLA haplotypes and HFE mutations were studied in hemochromatosis patients with present or past parental origin in a sparsely populated (1/km(2)) rural district (n = 8366 in the year of 2005), in central Sweden. Pedigrees were constructed from the Swedish church book registry. Extended haplotypes were studied to evaluate origin of recombinations. There were 87 original probands, 36 females and 51 males identified during 30 yr, of whom 86% carried C282Y/C282Y and 14% C282Y/H63D. Of 32 different HLA haplotypes A1-B8 was the most common (34%), followed by A3-B7 (16%), both in strong linkage disequilibrium with controls, (P < 0.001). Twenty-nine different families with A1-B8 had a common founder origin 15 generations ago in small bottleneck populations of the late 16th century. A second A1-B8 founder born 1655 was of Norwegian origin. Most of the A3 carriers (n = 26) had a common founder origin 16 generations ago in an even smaller nearby river valley. A fourth founder family carrying HLA-A2 seems to have originated from a recombination along the descendant lines from the A3 ancestor supported by extended haplotype studies. A1-haplotypes with alleles at the B locus different from B8 had a similar recombination origin as HLA-A2 alleles and a common founder origin 11 generations ago. The intergenerational time interval averaged 35.5 +/- 7.9 yr in men and 31.9 +/- 5.9 in females. River valley populations may contain HLA haplotypes reflecting their demographic history. This study has demonstrated that the resistance against recombinations between HLA-A and HFE make HLA haplotypes excellent markers for population movements. Founder effects and genetic drift from bottleneck populations (surviving the plague?) may explain the commonness of the mutation in central Scandinavia. The intergenerational time difference >30 yr was greater than expected and means that the age of the original mutation may be underestimated.	18363869
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE p.C282Y heterozygosity is associated with earlier disease onset in Friedreich ataxia.	Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society	2014	6.01	Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) generally results from reduced frataxin, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism. We assessed whether HFE p.C282Y and/or p.H63D heterozygosity modifies age at disease onset or disease severity in individuals with FRDA. One hundred seventy individuals with FRDA were assessed for the association of HFE p.C282Y and p.H63D with (1) age at disease onset and (2) Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) score. After adjusting for the smaller FXN GAA repeat size and sex, individuals with FRDA and heterozygous for p.C282Y had disease onset on average 3.72 years earlier than those homozygous for the wild-type amino acid (P = 0.02). Neither mutation affected disease severity as measured by FARS. It is hypothesized that the association between p.C282Y heterozygosity and an earlier age at FRDA onset relates to exacerbation of the already dysregulated iron metabolism that plays a major role in the pathogenesis of FRDA.	24390816
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	[Stroke and iridodonesis revealing a homocystinuria caused by a compound heterozygous mutation of cystathionine beta-synthase].	Revue neurologique		0.96	Iridodonesis or tremulous iris is a clinical sign of ectopia lentis which is frequently associated with homocystinuria. We present a forty-two-year-old woman victim of a left middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke. The clinical examination found bilateral iridodonesis and laboratory tests showed an increased level of serum homocysteine and homocystinuria. Homocystinuria was caused by a compound heterozygous I278T and D444N mutation of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene and also a C667T heterozygous polymorphism of methylene-tetrahydrofolate-reductase gene. This case was atypical because of the incomplete phenotype, development of complications in adulthood and the association of a rare compound heterozygous mutation of the CBS gene.	18805305
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Down-regulation of hepcidin in porphyria cutanea tarda.	Blood	2008	11.84	Hepatic siderosis is common in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). Mutations in the hereditary hemochromatosis (hh) gene (HFE) explain the siderosis in approximately 20% patients, suggesting that the remaining occurrences result from additional genetic and environmental factors. Two genes known to modify iron loading in hh are hepcidin (HAMP) and hemojuvelin (HJV). To determine if mutations in or expression of these genes influenced iron overload in PCT, we compared sequences of HAMP and HJV in 96 patients with PCT and 88 HFE C282Y homozygotes with marked hepatic iron overload. We also compared hepatic expression of these and other iron-related genes in a group of patients with PCT and hh. Two intronic polymorphisms in HJV were associated with elevated serum ferritin in HFE C282Y homozygotes. No exonic polymorphisms were identified. Sequencing of HAMP revealed exonic polymorphisms in 2 patients with PCT: heterozygosity for a G-->A transition (G71D substitution) in one and heterozygosity for an A-->G transition (K83R substitution) in the other. Hepatic HAMP expression in patients with PCT was significantly reduced, regardless of HFE genotype, when compared with patients with hh but without PCT with comparable iron overload. These data indicate that the hepatic siderosis associated with PCT likely results from dysregulated HAMP.	18809758
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Homozygous deletion of HFE produces a phenotype similar to the HFE p.C282Y/p.C282Y genotype.	Blood	2008	11.84	Hemochromatosis is predominantly associated with the HFE p.C282Y homozygous genotype, which is carried by approximately 1 person in 200 in Northern European populations. However, p.C282Y homozygosity is often characterized by incomplete penetrance. Here, we describe the case of a woman who had a major structural alteration in the HFE gene. Molecular characterization revealed an Alu-mediated recombination leading to the loss of the entire HFE gene sequence. Although homozygous for the HFE deleted allele, the woman had a phenotype similar to that seen in most women homozygous for the common p.C282Y mutation. Contrasting with previously reported results in Hfe knockout and Hfe knockin mice, our report gives further evidence that progression of the disease depends on modifying factors.	18809761
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations in heart disease.	Heart and vessels	2008	2.29	Given the reported association of cardiac complications with hereditary hemochromatosis and the high carrier frequency of HFE gene mutations in the natural population, it seems reasonable that such mutations might appear more frequently than expected among symptomatic cardiac patients. Thus, H63D, C282Y, and S65C mutations and their possible associations were examined in 477 Caucasian males undergoing coronary angiography. Genotypes were analyzed for differences between ferritin and transferrin levels, coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiomyopathy (CM), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. No significant differences were found in ferritin levels between those with or without HFE mutations (C282Y P = 0.632, H63D P = 0.765, S65C P = 0.568, and HFE mutation P = 0.568); however, there was a significant difference (P = 0.005) in mean transferrin levels between those with (252 microg/l) and without (275 microg/l) C282Y. No relationship between HFE mutations and CAD (C282Y, P = 0.402; H63D, P = 0.112; S65C, P = 0.170) or CVD death (C282Y, P = 0.560; H63D, P = 0.682; S65C, P = 0.664) was demonstrated using logistic regression. However, an association between S65C and CM was found (odds ratio 4.4; 95% confidence interval 1.3-13.3, P = 0.018). This suggests that the S65C allele may contribute to the development of CM, but that these three HFE mutations do not appear to play a significant role in development of ischemic heart disease.	18810584
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Does the SLC40A1 gene modify HFE-related haemochromatosis phenotypes?	Annals of hematology	2009	3.02	Most hereditary haemochromatosis patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. However, the phenotypic expression and clinical aggressiveness of the disease differs considerably from patient to patient. The main objective of this work was to study the role of variants in the SLC40A1 gene in the severity of iron overload and his clinical consequences in 100 Spanish probands homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. We performed automated sequencing of the coding regions, including intron-exon junctions of the SLC40A1 gene. We studied the association between polymorphisms in the SLC40A1 gene and median values of iron removed, taking into account statistical corrections for multiple comparisons. No pathogenic mutations in the SLC40A1 were detected. Five known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, and two of them were associated with phenotypic characteristics. IVS1-24 C>G was associated with the amount of iron removed and presence of liver disease: Of the 83 patients finally studied for this SNP, the amount of iron removed was above the median in 36 of 56 (64.3%) for C/C, in nine of 23(39.1%) for C/G and in zero of four (0%) for G/G patients (P=0.01). Liver damage was observed in 34 of 56 patients (60.7%) for C/C, in eight of 23 (34.8%) for C/G and in zero of four (0%) for G/G (P=0.01). Both associations remained significant at multivariate analysis (P=0.011 and P=0.023, respectively). IVS1-24 C>G on the ferroportin gene seems to be a genetic modifier for clinical aggressiveness of HFE1 haemochromatosis.	18820912
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased risk of death from iron overload among 422 treated probands with HFE hemochromatosis and serum levels of ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L at diagnosis.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2012	7.68	We investigated the risk of death from iron overload among treated hemochromatosis probands who were homozygous for HFE C282Y and had serum levels of ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L at diagnosis. We compared serum levels of ferritin at diagnosis and other conditions with the rate of iron overload-associated death using data from 2 cohorts of probands with hemochromatosis who were homozygous for HFE C282Y (an Alabama cohort, n = 294, 63.9% men and an Ontario cohort, n = 128, 68.8% men). We defined iron overload-associated causes of death as cirrhosis (including hepatic failure and primary liver cancer) caused by iron deposition and cardiomyopathy caused by myocardial siderosis. All probands received phlebotomy and other appropriate therapy. The mean survival times after diagnosis were 13.2 ± 7.3 y and 12.5 ± 8.3 y in Alabama and Ontario probands, respectively. Serum levels of ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L at diagnosis were observed in 30.1% and 47.7% of Alabama and Ontario probands, respectively. In logistic regressions of serum ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L, there were significant positive associations with male sex and cirrhosis in Alabama probands and with age, male sex, increased levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, and cirrhosis in Ontario probands. Of probands with serum levels of ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L at diagnosis, 17.9% of those from Alabama and 14.8% of those from Ontario died of iron overload. Among probands with serum levels of ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L, the relative risk of iron overload-associated death was 5.4 for the Alabama group (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2-13.1; P = .0002) and 4.9 for the Ontario group (95% CI, 1.1-22.0; P = .0359). In hemochromatosis probands homozygous for HFE C282Y, serum levels of ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L at diagnosis were positively associated with male sex and cirrhosis. Even with treatment, the relative risk of death from iron overload was 5-fold greater in probands with serum levels of ferritin greater than 1000 μg/L.	22265917
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Distribution of C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene in healthy Asian Indians and patients with thalassaemia major.	The National medical journal of India		0.5	Mutations in the HFE gene have been shown to be strongly associated with hereditary haemochromatosis, an autosomal recessive disease of iron overloading. The majority of patients with hereditary haemochromatosis possess a homozygous mutation C282Y that disrupts the binding of the HFE gene with beta2 microglobulin and prevents its surface expression. Another HFE mutation H63D is known to increase the relative risk of developing hereditary haemochromatosis. This disease is rare in India although secondary haemochromatosis is commonly seen among children suffering from thalassaemia major. The status of HFE mutations has not been explored among Indians, particularly in patients with thalassaemia major. It is also possible that in India clinical haemochromatosis could be masked by iron deficiency. We examined a cohort of 59 unrelated, healthy individuals from north India, 57 from south India and 75 thalassaemia major patients from north India for HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) in cis/trans by the polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer method. The C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene were rare among Indians. Although the HFE mutations were increased among patients of thalassaemia their effect on iron burden or disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Hereditary haemochromatosis is rarely observed among Indians and so are the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene. Long-term follow up studies would be required to determine whether the relatively higher frequency of these mutations among patients of thalassaemia has any influence on iron accumulation.	14765621
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Diagnostic utility of HFE variants in Spanish patients: association with HLA alleles and role in susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia.	Gene	2013	2.32	Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Human Hemochromatosis (HFE) gene, C282Y and H63D, are the major variants associated to altered iron status and it is well known that these mutations are in linkage disequilibrium with certain Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-A alleles. In addition, the C282Y SNP has been previously suggested to confer susceptibility to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We have aimed to assess the diagnosis utility of these polymorphisms in a population of Spanish subjects with suspicion of hereditary iron overload and to evaluate the effect of their associations with HLA-A alleles on the susceptibility to ALL. Both the 63DD [OR=4.31 (1.7-11.2)] and 282YY (p for trend=0.02) genotypes were more frequently found among subjects with suspicion of iron overload than among controls. 282YY carriers displayed significantly higher transferrin saturation index (TSI) values (p<0.001) as well as serum iron (p=0.01) and ferritin (p=0.01) levels. In addition, transferrin levels were lower in these subjects (p=0.01). Likewise, patients who were carriers of the compound heterozygous diplotype (282CY/63HD) showed significantly higher TSI and serum iron and ferritin concentrations. The H63D SNP did not significantly affect the analytical parameters measured. All 282YY carriers and 69.2% of compound heterozygotes showed an altered biochemical index. The frequencies of the HFE SNPs in ALL pediatric patients were lower than those found in controls, whereas the HLA-A*24 allele was significantly overrepresented in the patients group [OR=3.76 (1.9-7.3)]. No HFE-HLA-A associations were found to modulate the ALL risk. These results suggest that it may be useful to test for both HFE H63D and C282Y polymorphisms in patients with iron overload, as opposed to just genotyping for the C282Y SNP, which is customary in some healthcare centers. These HFE variants and their associations with HLA-A alleles were not observed to be relevant for the susceptibility to ALL in our population.	23178241
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening selected blood donors with biochemical iron overload for hemochromatosis: a regional experience.	Haematologica	2004	6.67	Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive iron overload which leads to early abnormalities of iron parameters (increased transferrin saturation =TS and serum ferritin=SF) and late clinical complications. The disease is prevalently due to C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene, but additional molecular defects are present in a minority of patients. From January to December 2002 we screened first time blood donors of Piedmont, a region of North-western Italy, for TS>45%. Individuals with TS>45% underwent a second fasting check, SF assessment and molecular tests, investigating 12 hemochromatosis-associated molecular defects. A total of 13,998 subjects were screened; 868 (6.2%) had TS>45% and were recalled. Four hundred and eight-six underwent molecular testing. In this selected population allele frequencies of C282Y, H63D and S65C were 6.8%, 22.4% and 1.0%, respectively. No rare mutations were detected, except E168Q in HFE. When measured during fasting, TS was significantly higher in C282Y homozygotes and H63D/C282Y heterozygotes (p<0.05) than in wild type subjects, but not in H63D homozygotes. Hyperferritinemia was documented in 32 cases, 9 with wild type genotype. Mean age, body mass index (BMI) and alcohol intake were higher in this group than in individuals with normal SF. This study is an example of a large, two-step hemochromatosis screening with moderate effort and low cost, that enriches basal C282Y allele frequency by about three-fold. Screening based on genotyping only subjects found to have a TS>45% is feasible but, in order to be cost effective should be based on the identification of the two prevalent mutations even in an area where several forms of hemochromatosis have been reported.	15477198
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genotype-based screening for hereditary haemochromatosis. I: Technical performance, costs and clinical relevance of a German pilot study.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2005	4.58	In 2001, we initiated a pilot study on DNA-based screening of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) in Germany. A total of 5882 insurants of the German sickness fund Kaufmannische Krankenkasse-KKH requested information on this project, and 3961 of these individuals provided blood samples for testing of the HFE mutation C282Y. Of these, 3930 samples were successfully tested with two independent test methods, and the results were communicated to the referring doctors. In all, 67 of the tested individuals were homozygous for C282Y. Partially, this high rate (1.7%) can be explained by the fact that 42.6% of the homozygotes already knew their clinical diagnosis HH before sending the blood sample. Iron accumulation with further signs or symptoms of HH was present in eight of 34 newly diagnosed C282Y homozygous individuals. Two major aspects of our study were the analytic validity and the direct laboratory costs of different test methods. Of 7860 tests performed, 7841 (99.6%) gave correct results. The overall error rate was 0.24% (95% CI: 0.15-0.38%). The analytic specificity of the tests methods with respect to the detection of homozygosity for C282Y was 100% (7726 of 7726 nonhomozygous test challenges, 95% CI: 99.95-100%), while the analytic sensitivity was 97% (130 of 134 homozygous test challenges, 95% CI: 92.5-99.2%). The direct costs ranged from 11.20-16.35 [euro] per test method. We conclude that the test methods for C282Y are robust, highly sensitive and specific, and that a DNA-based HH-screening program can be performed at reasonable laboratory costs.	15483651
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepcidin is decreased in TFR2 hemochromatosis.	Blood	2005	11.84	The hepatic peptide hepcidin is the key regulator of iron metabolism in mammals. Recent evidence indicates that certain forms of hereditary hemochromatosis are caused by hepcidin deficiency. Juvenile hemochromatosis is associated with hepcidin or hemojuvelin mutations, and these patients have low or absent urinary hepcidin. Patients with C282Y HFE hemochromatosis also have inappropriately low hepcidin levels for the degree of iron loading. The relationship between the hemochromatosis due to transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) mutations and hepcidin was unknown. We measured urinary hepcidin levels in 10 patients homozygous for TFR2 mutations, all with increased transferrin saturation. Urinary hepcidin was low or undetectable in 8 of 10 cases irrespective of the previous phlebotomy treatments. The only 2 cases with normal hepcidin values had concomitant inflammatory conditions. Our data indicate that TFR2 is a modulator of hepcidin production in response to iron.	15486069
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE polymorphisms affect survival of brain tumor patients.	Journal of neuro-oncology	2015	2.75	The HFE (high iron) protein plays a key role in the regulation of body iron. HFE polymorphisms (H63D and C282Y) are the common genetic variants in Caucasians. Based on frequency data, both HFE polymorphisms have been associated with increased risk in a number of cancers. The prevalence of the two major HFE polymorphisms in a human brain tumor patient populations and the impact of HFE polymorphisms on survival have not been studied. In the present study, there is no overall difference in survival by HFE genotype. However, male GBM patients with H63D HFE (H63D) have poorer overall survival than wild type HFE (WT) male GBM (p = 0.03). In GBM patients with the C282Y HFE polymorphism (C282Y), female patients have poorer survival than male patients (p = 0.05). In addition, female metastatic brain tumor patients with C282Y have shorter survival times post diagnosis than WT patients (p = 0.02) or male metastatic brain tumor patients with C282Y (p = 0.02). There is a tendency toward a lower proportion of H63D genotype in GBM patients than a non-tumor control group (p = 0.09) or other subtypes of brain tumors. In conclusion, our study suggests that HFE genotype impacts survival of brain tumor patients in a gender specific manner. We previously reported that glioma and neuroblastoma cell lines with HFE polymorphisms show greater resistance to chemo and radiotherapy. Taken together, these data suggest HFE genotype is an important consideration for evaluating and planning therapeutic strategies in brain tumor patients.	25491948
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis in C282Y homozygous HFE hemochromatosis.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2015	4.47	C282Y homozygotes with serum ferritin (SF) levels >1000 μg/L and/or increased serum transaminase levels are at risk of severe F3/F4 fibrosis. Current practical guidelines recommend liver biopsy in such individuals. This prospective observational cohort study aimed to evaluate non-invasive alternative means such as hyaluronic acid (HA) and transient elastography (TE) for the assessment of severe fibrosis in patients with SF >1000 μg/L or elevated transaminases. Between September 2005 and April 2013, 77 patients diagnosed C282Y homozygotes underwent a liver biopsy because of SF >1000 μg/L and/or increased transaminases according to current guidelines, with concomitant TE. All of them had clinical and biological evaluation, including HA measurement in 52 cases. A total of 19.5% of patients had F3-F4 severe fibrosis. HA was higher in patients with severe fibrosis, but did not accurately predict severe fibrosis. TE was significantly higher in patients with severe fibrosis (17.2 vs. 4.9 kPa; P < 0.05) and was able to accurately predict fibrosis stage in 47/61 (77%) patients with valid measurement using a lower threshold of 6.4 kPa and an upper threshold of 13.9 kPa. Efficient assessment of severe fibrosis was not possible in patients with intermediate TE values. An algorithm that successively employed SF and TE can accurately classify severe fibrosis in 61% of patients, restricting the need for liver biopsy to the 39% of patients with intermediate or unvalid TE values. This algorithm should be validated in independent cohorts before extended use.	25495562
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene variants and iron-induced oxygen radical generation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.	The European respiratory journal	2015	0.5	In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), lung accumulation of excessive extracellular iron and macrophage haemosiderin may suggest disordered iron homeostasis leading to recurring microscopic injury and fibrosing damage. The current study population comprised 89 consistent IPF patients and 107 controls. 54 patients and 11 controls underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Haemosiderin was assessed by Perls' stain, BAL fluid malondialdehyde (MDA) by high-performance liquid chromatography, BAL cell iron-dependent oxygen radical generation by fluorimetry and the frequency of hereditary haemochromatosis HFE gene variants by reverse dot blot hybridisation. Macrophage haemosiderin, BAL fluid MDA and BAL cell unstimulated iron-dependent oxygen radical generation were all significantly increased above controls (p<0.05). The frequency of C282Y, S65C and H63D HFE allelic variants was markedly higher in IPF compared with controls (40.4% versus 22.4%, OR 2.35, p=0.008) and was associated with higher iron-dependent oxygen radical generation (HFE variant 107.4±56.0, HFE wild type (wt) 59.4±36.4 and controls 16.7±11.8 fluorescence units per 10(5) BAL cells; p=0.028 HFE variant versus HFE wt, p=0.006 HFE wt versus controls). The data suggest iron dysregulation associated with HFE allelic variants may play an important role in increasing susceptibility to environmental exposures, leading to recurring injury and fibrosis in IPF.	25504993
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Development of a multiplex ARMS test for mutations in the HFE gene associated with hereditary haemochromatosis.	Journal of clinical pathology	1998	2.91	Genetic testing for hereditary haemochromatosis is likely to be a significant workload for diagnostic laboratories. The C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene associated with hereditary haemochromatosis have previously been detected using a number of methods including alterations in the restriction digest pattern of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified products. An amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) has been developed that will simultaneously detect both hereditary haemochromatosis mutations. Comparison of the results obtained from the analysis of 46 samples referred for hereditary haemochromatosis testing showed no discrepancies between ARMS and restriction enzyme digestion. Furthermore, consistent results were obtained by ARMS from both blood and buccal mouthwash samples. The ARMS test is quicker and less expensive in terms of consumables and scientist time than restriction enzyme analysis, and is therefore suited to the routine diagnostic analysis of hereditary haemochromatosis.	9577377
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The hemochromatosis 845 G-->A and 187 C-->G mutations: prevalence in non-Caucasian populations.	American journal of human genetics	1998	10.79	Hemochromatosis, the inherited disorder of iron metabolism, leads, if untreated, to progressive iron overload and premature death. The hemochromatosis gene, HFE, recently has been identified, and characterization of this gene has shown that it contains two mutations that result in amino acid substitutions-cDNA nucleotides 845 G-->A (C282Y) and 187 C-->G (H63D). Although hemochromatosis is common in Caucasians, affecting >=1/300 individuals of northern European origin, it has not been recognized in other populations. The present study used PCR and restriction-enzyme digestion to analyze the frequency of the 845 G-->A and 187 C-->G mutations in HLA-typed samples from non-Caucasian populations, comprising Australian Aboriginal, Chinese, and Pacific Islanders. Results showed that the 845 G-->A mutation was present in these populations (allele frequency 0.32%), and, furthermore, it was always seen in conjunction with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that 845 G-->A may have been introduced into these populations by Caucasian admixture. 187 C-->G was present at an allele frequency of 2.68% in the two populations analyzed (Australian Aboriginal and Chinese). In the Australian Aboriginal samples, 187 C-->G was found to be associated with HLA haplotypes common in Caucasians, suggesting that it was introduced by recent admixture. In the Chinese samples analyzed, 187 C-->G was present in association with a wide variety of HLA haplotypes, showing this mutation to be widespread and likely to predate the more genetically restricted 845 G-->A mutation.	9585606
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Biochemistry and molecular genetics of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency.	European journal of pediatrics	1998	1.79	"""Homocysteine is an independent risk factor for arteriosclerotic disease. Deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is the major cause of inherited homocysteinemia. The CBS gene is 25-30 kbp long and encodes a subunit of 63 kDa. The active form of the enzyme is a homotetramer that contains one heme and one pyridoxal 5'-phosphate per each subunit. It can also bind 1 mol of S-adenosylmethionine per mol of subunit. To date, an analysis of 205 homocystinuric alleles has been performed and 64 mutations found. The best studied, relatively """"homogeneous"""" patient populations are those of Ireland, Holland, and Italy. While the overall frequency of the two most frequent mutations is 24% for I278T and 31% for G307S, the breakdown between the countries varies greatly. For instance, the B6-nonresponsive G307S mutation accounts for > 70% alleles in Ireland and B6-responsive I278T mutation on the continent approaches 45%. In conclusion, further research is needed to define the mutations in individual countries to facilitate screening and genotype/phenotype correlations. Future biochemical studies will likely elucidate the role of heme in the enzyme and the tertiary structure of CBS."""	9587026
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE, hepcidin and ferroportin gene mutations are not present in Indian patients with primary haemochromatosis.	The National medical journal of India		0.5	Primary haemochromatosis is characterized by iron overload in the body tissues. It is common in populations of northern European descent. In such populations, 85%-90% of patients with this disease have a C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. In India, the disease is uncommon and the genetic defects associated with it are unknown. We therefore looked for mutations in the HFE and other genes involved in iron metabolism in Indian patients with primary haemochromatosis. Five patients (including a brother-sister pair) with primary haemochromatosis diagnosed on clinical, biochemical and histological findings were studied. Genomic DNA was analysed by sequencing for the presence of mutations in all the 6 exons of the HFE gene and for previously described mutations in genes encoding hepcidin antimicrobial peptide and ferroportin. No patient had the C282Y mutation. One had homozygous H63D mutation. No other mutation was found in any HFE exon. Two previously reported splice site mutations in the HFE gene (IVS3 + 1 G/T and IVS5+1 G/A) were not detected. Four of the 5 patients had an HFE splice site mutation (IVS2 + 4 T/C; homozygous 2, heterozygous 2); however, this change was as frequent in 29 healthy subjects (homozygous 9, heterozygous 7), and was present in only 1 of the sibling pair patients, indicating that this represented a polymorphism. No patient had any of the previously described mutations in the genes for hepcidin and ferroportin. Our patients with primary haemochromatosis lacked mutations in the HFE, hepcidin and ferroportin genes. Further genetic analysis may help identify novel mutations responsible for primary haemochromatosis in these patients.	16570681
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations are associated with osteoarthritis in the index or middle finger metacarpophalangeal joints.	The Journal of rheumatology	2006	0.5	. To test the hypothesis that possession of either C282Y or H63D mutations in the HFE gene is associated with primary osteoarthritis (OA) in joints commonly affected in hemochromatotic arthropathy. HFE genotyping was performed in 87 patients with radiologically proven OA in 3 joint regions: index or middle finger metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP2,3; n = 52), elbow joints (n = 8), ankle, intertarsal or tarsometatarsal joints (ankle/IT/TMT; n = 27); and in 56 patients with radiologically proven OA in finger interphalangeal (IP) joints, but not MCP2,3 joints (IP OA control group). HFE mutation frequencies in these groups were also compared to those in a similar population (Busselton population control group). A statistically significant association between HFE mutations and OA was observed for the MCP2,3 joints (p = 0.0001) and the ankle/IT/TMT joint group (p = 0.002) as well as for the 3 joint regions collectively (p = 0.0001), but not for the elbow joints (p = 0.062). Comparison with the Busselton population controls showed similar statistically significant associations, except for the elbow and ankle/IT/TMT groups, where similar trends were observed. HFE gene mutations are associated with OA in the MCP2,3 joints. These mutations may be markers for a polyarticular OA phenotype.	16583477

Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2006	4.47	The variability in phenotypic expression of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is not fully understood. We sought to examine whether the metabolic syndrome, hepatic steatosis or steatohepatitis influenced hepatic fibrosis among patients with HH and iron overload. We identified 86 patients with C282Y/C282Y or C282Y/H63D HH and iron overload (hepatic iron concentration (HIC) >2,200 microg/g for males, >1,600 microg/g for females). Features of the metabolic syndrome were assessed at the time of liver biopsy. Biopsies were scored by a blinded pathologist. Significant fibrosis was defined as peri-portal fibrosis or greater. The mean (+/-SD) age of the study population was 53+/-12 years and 68 (79%) were male. The median (range) values of ferritin and HIC were 1,125 (253-9,530) microg/l and 9963 (1926-50 887) microg/g, respectively. The metabolic syndrome was present in 23 (27%), hepatic steatosis in 43 (50%), steatohepatitis in 18 (21%) and significant fibrosis in 38 (44%). Overall, neither the metabolic syndrome nor any of its components were associated with significant fibrosis or a higher mean fibrosis stage. Hepatic steatosis but not steatohepatitis was associated with a lower fibrosis stage. C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous individuals who had glucose intolerance had more severe fibrosis compared with those without glucose intolerance (1.0+/-1.0 vs. 0.1+/-0.3, P=0.01). Overall, the metabolic syndrome and fatty liver were not associated with hepatic fibrosis among individuals with HH and iron overload. However, glucose intolerance may be important risk factor for the development of hepatic fibrosis in subjects with the C282Y/H63D HFE genotype.	16584391
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Fatty liver in H63D homozygotes with hyperferritinemia.	World journal of gastroenterology	2006	2.79	To study the clinical correlates of the H63D mutation we have analysed the phenotype of H63D homo-zygotes identified through mutation analysis in a referral laboratory. A total of 366 blood samples referred for HFE analysis were screened for C282Y and H63D mutations. Four H63D homozygotes were identified. All had raised serum ferritin but normal transferrin saturation. They were negative for hepatitis B and C and only one patient consumed excess alcohol. In all 4 cases ultrasonography revealed fatty liver. In two patients a liver biopsy was done and showed mild siderosis with an unusual distribution and macrovesicular steatosis. These data confirm the association between fatty liver, hyperferritinaemia and increased hepatic iron, but do not clarify whether siderosis was related to steatosis rather than homozygosity for the H63D mutation. Patients with fatty liver may complicate the interpretation of data in population studies of the expression of H63D homozygosity.	16586555
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The role of iron and haemochromatosis gene mutations in the progression of liver disease in chronic hepatitis C.	Gut	2002	14.92	Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is frequently associated with elevated markers of iron stores. Recessively inherited mutations in the HFE gene are responsible for iron accumulation in most cases of hereditary haemochromatosis and may have a role in HCV infection. They may also be associated with progressive liver fibrosis although this remains controversial. To assess the prevalence of HFE mutations in Scottish HCV infected patients and to explore the effect of the carrier state on serum and liver iron stores, and the severity of liver disease. A total of 164 patients with antibodies to HCV who underwent liver biopsy were assessed prospectively. Each patient was screened for HFE mutations (Cys282Tyr and His63Asp). Iron markers were assessed in serum (ferritin, transferrin saturation) and on liver biopsy (stainable iron, liver iron concentration (LIC) and hepatic iron index). There were 67 (41%, 26 Cys282Tyr, 33 His63Asp, eight compound) heterozygotes. Forty four (28%) patients had elevated serum iron markers, 24 (15%) had stainable liver iron, and five (3%) had elevated LICs. Carriage of HFE mutations was not associated with any clinical, biochemical, virological, or pathological features, including accumulation of liver iron. Elevated serum iron markers were associated with male sex, increased alcohol consumption, and increased liver inflammation and fibrosis. Patients with elevated LICs were older, acquired HCV infection earlier, and had more liver inflammation. Patients with chronic HCV infection frequently have elevated serum iron markers although elevated LICs are uncommon. Elevated serum iron studies and LICs occur in patients with more severe liver disease. Carriage of HFE mutations, although frequently observed in these HCV infected patients, does not have a role in the accumulation of iron or the progression of liver disease in HCV infection.	11788568
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum ceruloplasmin and ferroxidase activity are decreased in HFE C282Y homozygote male iron-overloaded patients.	Journal of hepatology	2002	10.59	A body of evidence suggests that ceruloplasmin (Cp), the major serum copper-containing protein, acts in iron metabolism due to its ferroxidase activity which appears essential for iron movements and exchanges. The present study investigated the serum levels of Cp and its ferroxidase activity in 53 C282Y homozygote genetic hemochromatosis (38 iron overloaded, 15 iron depleted) patients as compared to age and sex-matched healthy volunteers. Serum levels of Cp were significantly decreased in iron-overloaded male hemochromatotic patients vs. the control group (P=0.02). Furthermore, serum ferroxidase activity was strongly and significantly lower in iron-overloaded male hemochromatotic patients (P<0.001). In contrast, in iron-depleted male hemochromatotic patients, who were under maintenance therapy by regular phlebotomies, serum levels of Cp and ferroxidase activity were not statistically different from those observed in controls. These data: (i) show that serum Cp and ferroxidase activity are decreased when C282Y homozygote men are iron overloaded and normal when iron depleted; (ii) suggest that iron may modulate the Cp gene expression; and (iii) raise the issue of the putative role of decreased serum ferroxidase activity in the phenotypic expression of HFE-1 hereditary hemochromatosis.	11804665
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of HFE gene C282Y and H63D mutations in a French-Canadian population of neonates and in referred patients.	Human molecular genetics	2002	5.99	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disease characterized by exaggerated absorption of intestinal iron leading to its accumulation in some organs over the years. Its prevalence is estimated to be 3-5/1000 in Caucasians. A single mutation, C282Y in the HFE gene explains 80-90% of all diagnosed cases in populations of northwestern European ancestry. The importance of another frequent mutation in this gene, H63D, as well as of C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes, is still a matter of debate. We estimated the prevalence of these mutations in newborns from a genetically well defined French-Canadian population, in Quebec City. We compared genotype and allele frequencies between neonates and referred patients for HFE molecular analysis. We genotyped anonymous-unlinked cord blood samples for C282Y (n = 881) and H63D (n = 870) mutations from neonates. Referred patients (n = 1084) were genotyped in two different laboratories and pooled after verifying the similarity of both groups. No C282Y homozygote was found in neonates (allele frequency = 0.043). However, we identified 163 C282Y homozygotes (15%) among 1084 referred patients leading to a, not surprising, 97-fold enrichment of this genotype. We found a similar proportion of genotypes homozygous for H63D in both groups suggesting a weak association with the disease. However, we found a 5-fold enrichment of compound heterozygotes in the referred group. Fewer C282Y homozygotes were observed in the French-Canadian population than in northwest Europe populations. However, the strong enrichment of homozygotes between the neonates and the referred patients is an argument in favour of screening for this lethal disease.	11809727
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Penetrance of 845G--> A (C282Y) HFE hereditary haemochromatosis mutation in the USA.	Lancet (London, England)	2002	0.5	"""There has been much interest in screening populations for disease-associated mutations. A favoured candidate has been the HFE gene, mutations of which are the most common cause of haemochromatosis in the European population. About five people in 1000 are homozygotes for the 845G-->A mutation, but little is known of how many have mutation-caused clinical manifestations. We screened 41038 individuals attending a health appraisal clinic in the USA for the 845G--> A and 187C-->G HFE mutations, and analysed laboratory data and data on signs and symptoms of haemochromatosis as elicited by questionnaire. The most common symptoms of haemochromatosis, including poor general health, diabetes, arthropathies, arrhythmias, impotence, and skin pigmentation were no more prevalent among the 152 identified homozygotes than among the controls. The age distribution of homozygotes and compound heterozygotes did not differ significantly from that of controls: there was no measurable loss of such individuals from the population during ageing. However, there was a significantly increased prevalence of a history of hepatitis or """"liver trouble"""" among homozygotes and in the proportion of homozygotes with increased concentrations of serum aspartate aminotransferase and collagen IV; these changes were not related to iron burden or to age. Only one of the 152 homozygotes had signs and symptoms that would suggest a diagnosis of haemochromatosis. The normal age distribution of people with the haemochromatosis genotype, and the lack of symptoms in patients of all ages, indicate that the penetrance of hereditary haemochromatosis is much lower than generally thought. The clinical penetrance of a disorder is an essential consideration in screening for genetic disease; disorders with low penetrance are more expensive candidates for screening than disorders with high penetrance. Our best estimate is that less than 1% of homozygotes develop frank clinical haemochromatosis."""	11812557
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Variation in the HFE gene is associated with the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity in testicular cancer patients.	European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)	2016	0.5	Bleomycin and cisplatin are of key importance in testicular cancer treatment. Known potential serious adverse effects are bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity (BIP) and cisplatin-induced renal toxicity. Iron handling may play a role in development of this toxicity. Carriage of allelic variants of the HFE gene induces altered iron metabolism and may contribute to toxicity. We investigated the association between two common allelic variants of the HFE gene, H63D and C282Y, with development of pulmonary and renal toxicity during and after treatment with bleomycin- and cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. In 369 testicular cancer patients treated with bleomycin and cisplatin at the University Medical Center Groningen between 1978 and 2006, H63D and/or C282Y genotypes were determined with an allelic discrimination assay. Data were collected on development of BIP, pulmonary function parameters, renal function, and survival. BIP developed more frequently in patients who were heterozygote (16 in 75, 21%) and homozygote (2 in 4, 50%) for the H63D variant, compared with those who had the HFE wild-type gene (31 in 278, 11%) (p = 0.012). Overall survival, testicular cancer-related survival, and change in renal function were not associated with the H63D variant. We observed an association between presence of one or both H63D alleles and development of BIP in testicular cancer patients treated with bleomycin combination chemotherapy. In patients heterozygote and homozygote for the H63D variant, BIP occurred more frequently compared with wild-type patients. When validated and confirmed, HFE H63D genotyping may be used to identify patients with increased risk for pulmonary bleomycin toxicity.	27033261
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hyperferritinemia and iron overload in type 1 Gaucher disease.	American journal of hematology	2010	5.0	Hyperferritinemia occurs in Gaucher disease but its clinical spectrum or its association with systemic iron overload and HFE mutations are not known. In 114 patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease, we determined serum ferritin, transferrin saturation and HFE genotype. The results were correlated with the extent of hepatosplenomegaly, overall Gaucher disease severity score index, and response to enzyme replacement therapy. In a subset of patients with radiological and/or laboratory evidence of systemic iron overload, liver biopsy was performed. There was a mean 3.7-fold elevation of serum ferritin over the upper limit of normal (ULN). Prior splenectomy was associated with most severe hyperferritinemia compared to patients with intact spleen (6.53 x ULN vs. 2.69 x ULN, P = 0.003). HFE genotyping revealed two patients homozygous for H63D mutation and 30% of patients heterozygote carriers of H63D mutation; no patients harbored C282Y mutation; there was no correlation of ferritin with HFE genotype. Ferritin level correlated with liver volume (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.254, P = 0.035) and it was negatively correlated with hemoglobin (r = -0.315, P = 0.004); there was no relationship with other indicators of Gaucher disease activity. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) resulted in amelioration of hyperferritinemia: 707 +/- 898 ng/ml vs. 301 +/- 310 ng/ml (P = 0.001), transferrin saturation remained normal. Three patients were suspected of clinical iron overload, confirmed on liver biopsy. Iron accumulation was variably noted in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. There is a high prevalence of hyperferritinemia in Type 1 Gaucher disease that is associated with indicators of disease severity, reversed by ERT and is not related to HFE mutations.	20575041
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE Cys282Tyr homozygotes with serum ferritin concentrations below 1000 microg/L are at low risk of hemochromatosis.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2010	0.5	Hemochromatosis gene (HFE)-associated hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic predisposition to iron overload and subsequent signs and symptoms of disease that potentially affects approximately 80,000 persons in Australia and almost 1 million persons in the United States. Most clinical cases are homozygous for the Cys282Tyr (C282Y) mutation in the HFE gene, with serum ferritin (SF) concentration >1000 microg/L as the strongest predictor of cirrhosis. The optimal treatment regimen for those with SF concentrations above the normal range but <1000 microg/L is unknown. We assessed HFE mutations in a prospective cohort of 31,192 participants of northern European descent, aged 40-69 years. An HFE-stratified random sample of 1438 participants including all C282Y homozygotes with iron studies 12 years apart were examined by physicians blinded to participants' HFE genotype. All previously undiagnosed C282Y homozygotes (35 male, 67 female) and all HFE wild-types (131 male, 160 female) with baseline and follow-up SF concentrations <1000 microg/L were assessed for HH-associated signs and symptoms including abnormal second/third metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP2/3), raised liver enzymes, hepatomegaly, and self-reported liver disease, fatigue, diabetes mellitus, and use of arthritis medication. The prevalence of HH-associated signs and symptoms was similar for C282Y homozygotes and HFE wild-types for both normal and moderately elevated SF concentrations. The maximum prevalence difference between HFE genotype groups with moderately elevated SF was 11% (MCP2/3, 95% confidence interval = -6%, 29%; P = 0.22) and for normal SF was 6% (arthritis medicine use, 95% confidence interval = -3%, 16%; P = 0.11). Previously undiagnosed C282Y homozygotes with SF concentrations that remain below 1000 microg/L are at low risk of developing HH-associated signs and symptoms at an age when disease would be expected to have developed. These observations have implications for the management of C282Y homozygotes.	20583211
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene polymorphisms and severity in Portuguese patients with multiple sclerosis.	European journal of neurology	2011	3.96	High iron concentrations have been reported in oligodendrocytes, myelin and macrophages in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. It has been proposed that HFE gene polymorphisms could have a role in MS. The C282Y and H63D HFE variants frequencies were determined in 373 patients with MS and compared with a normal population. No significant association was found between HFE polymorphisms and disease susceptibility. An analysis of the association of genotypes with disease severity was performed, and the C282Y allele was more frequent in the aggressive group. Patients carrying the C282Y variant seem to have a worse prognosis.	20586792
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Significance of H63D homozygosity in a Basque population with hemochromatosis.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2010	3.32	The significance of H63D homozygosity remains uncertain, although it is associated with a tendency for patients to develop iron overload. To study the prevalence of homozygotic H63D mutation in patients with phenotypic hemochromatosis (PH) and to compare the results with those of the general population and with patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) in the Basque Country, Spain. A secondary aim was to evaluate the differences in phenotypic expression and liver injury according to different genotypes in the PH cohort. Mutations of the HFE gene were obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Forty consecutive patients diagnosed with PH, 116 controls and 54 patients with PCT were included in the study. We performed liver biopsies, measured liver iron concentration (LIC), by atomic spectrophotometry, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, and compared the histology according to the genotype. The H63D homozygote mutation was identified in 7.76% of the control group, in 7.50% of the PH group, and in 11.11% of patients with PCT (P > 0.05). The C282Y/C282Y mutation was present in 50% of patients with PH, and LIC was identified in 15/20. The LIC in C282Y/C282Y patients was higher than in H63D/H63D patients (P = 0.26), while H63D homozygosis caused greater iron overload in PH patients than other genotypes. All the C282Y/C282Y genotype patients had elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. The H63D homozygotes had high ferritin, but two out of three had normal transferrin saturation. Six of the eight patients with high-grade fibrosis and genetic study results were found to be C282Y/C282Y. The prevalence of H63D mutation in patients with PH in our region does not differ from that of the general Basque population.	20594259
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	On myocardial siderosis and left ventricular dysfunction in hemochromatosis.	Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance	2013	5.75	Chronically increased intestinal iron uptake in genetic hemochromatosis (HC) may cause organ failure. Whilst iron loading from blood transfusions may cause dilated cardiomyopathy in conditions such as thalassemia, the in-vivo prevalence of myocardial siderosis in HC is unclear, and its relation to left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is controversial. Most previous data on myocardial siderosis in HC has come from post-mortem studies. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) was performed at first presentation of 41 HC patients (58.9 ± 14.1 years) to measure myocardial iron and left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF). In 31 patients (genetically confirmed HFE-HC), the HFE genotype was C282Y/C282Y (n = 30) and C282Y/H63D (n = 1). Patients with other genotypes (n = 10) were labeled genetically unconfirmed HC. Of the genetically confirmed HFE-HC patients, 6 (19%) had myocardial siderosis (T2* <20 ms). Of these, 5 (83%) had heart failure and reduced LVEF which was correlated to the severity of siderosis (R2 0.57, p = 0.049). Two patients had follow-up scans and both had marked improvements in T2* and LVEF following venesection. Myocardial siderosis was present in 6/18 (33%) of patients with presenting ferritin ≥ 1000 μg/L at diagnosis but in 0/13 (0%) patients with ferritin <1000 μg/L (p = 0.028). Overall however, the relation between myocardial siderosis and ferritin was weak (R2 0.20, p = 0.011). In the 10 genetically unconfirmed HC patients, 1 patient had mild myocardial siderosis but normal EF. Of all 31 patients, 4 had low LVEF from other identifiable causes without myocardial siderosis. Myocardial siderosis was present in 33% of newly presenting genetically confirmed HFE-HC patients with ferritin >1000 μg/L, and was the commonest cause of reduced LVEF. Heart failure due to myocardial siderosis was only found in these HFE-HC patients, and was reversible with venesection. Myocardial iron was normal in patients with other causes of LV dysfunction.	23509881
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Telomere length and elevated iron: the influence of phenotype and HFE genotype.	American journal of hematology	2013	5.0	Elevated body iron stores are associated with morbidity and mortality due to oxidative stress. Hereditary hemochromatosis, a common condition caused by HFE gene mutations, can lead to excess iron storage and disease but clinical penetrance of HFE gene mutations is low and many people with elevated iron stores lack HFE mutations. We analyzed data from the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study to assess the relationship among HFE genotype (individuals with either homozygous or compound heterozygous status for C282Y and/or H63D HFE mutations were defined as genotype positive, or G+), elevated iron phenotype (individuals exceeding gender-specific transferrin saturation and serum ferritin threshold levels were considered phenotype positive, or P+), and leukocyte telomere length, a marker of biological aging and cumulative oxidative stress. In unadjusted analyses in comparison to individuals who were G-P-, G+P- were not significantly different (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.26-2.04), while the G+P+ (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.15-3.56), and G-P+ (OR 2.24; 95% CI 1.5-3.29) had increased risk of short telomeres (<=25th percentile) rather than long telomeres (>=75th percentile). In analyses adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity, the effect of individuals with elevated iron phenotypes having short telomeres persisted with G+P+ individuals (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.02-3.72), and G-P+ individuals (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.39-3.39) being significantly different from the G-P- group. In conclusion, elevated iron phenotype, but not HFE genotype, was associated with shortened telomeres. Further studies will be needed to determine whether telomere length provides a marker for morbidities specifically associated with iron overload.	23512844
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of the C282Y mutation for haemochromatosis on the Island of Majorca.	Clinical genetics	2000	3.89	The C282Y mutation of the HFE gene has been reported to be present in most of the patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) of Northern European ancestry. HH affects approximately 1/300 individuals, but it is not evenly distributed in the different European countries. In the present study, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction-enzyme digestion were used to analyse the frequency of the most important mutation in haemochromatosis (C282Y) in subjects from Majorca (Balearic Islands, Spain) and patients with haemochromatosis. The results were compared with other studies from Spain and Europe. A total of 420 Majorcan chromosomes were analysed and the C282Y mutation was observed at a frequency of 2.62%+/-0.8 (11 heterozygotes: eight men and three women). In the group of hereditary haemochromatosis probands, 13 out of 14 were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. In the distribution of the C282Y mutation, a north-west to south-east cline was detected, supporting the Celtic origin of this mutation.	11005145
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Frequency of HFE gene mutations and genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis in Switzerland].	Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift	2000	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic disorders affecting populations of European ancestry. Isolation of a strong candidate gene, the HFE gene, allows genetic diagnosis in a large number of cases. However, different mutation frequencies have been reported in hereditary haemochromatosis patient populations from various geographic regions. Such data and phenotype-genotype correlations from Swiss patients with hereditary haemochromatosis are lacking. The objective of our study was to determine the frequency of HFE gene mutations in Swiss patients with hereditary haemochromatosis and to describe the clinical phenotype of patients with either a homozygous C282Y mutation or compound heterozygotes. 71 patients with a clinical diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis were identified through a questionnaire sent to physicians caring for hereditary haemochromatosis patients. Pertinent clinical data, in particular those reflecting iron body stores, were collected. Genotyping for the C282Y and H63D mutation of the HFE gene was performed. In 90% of the cases a mutation of the HFE gene was found. 86% of the patients were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, 4% were compound heterozygotes for the C282Y and the H63D mutation. Patients with the homozygous C282Y mutation showed a broad phenotypic spectrum that could not be accounted for by age or sex differences only. Our results demonstrate that within the Swiss population genetic testing can also identify the vast majority of patients with hereditary haemochromatosis. However, the diagnosis is not ruled out by a negative genetic test. Furthermore, a broad phenotypic spectrum is associated with the homozygous C282Y mutation in Swiss hereditary haemochromatosis patients. The implications of these findings for planning of widespread genetic screening for hereditary haemochromatosis in the general population are discussed.	11008304
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Rapid single-tube screening of the C282Y hemochromatosis mutation by real-time multiplex allele-specific PCR without fluorescent probes.	Clinical chemistry	2000	7.46	An accurate determination of the major HFE mutation (C282Y), which is associated with hereditary hemochromatosis, is important in diagnosis and risk assessment for this disease. We report a single-tube high-throughput PCR method for the detection of C282Y. We combined three previously described principles: allele-specific PCR, mutagenically separated PCR, and amplicon identification by specific dissociation curves. PCR amplification was performed with fluorescence detection or conventional thermocycler using the same primers, reactant constituents, and cycling protocol. Primer cross-reactions were prevented by deliberate primer:primer and primer:template mismatches. PCR products were identified by their characteristic melting temperatures based on SYBR Green I fluorescence. For each of the 256 random and 17 known HFE C282Y samples, mutant homozygous, wild-type, and heterozygous samples were unequivocally distinguished. This homogeneous assay is rapid, reproducible, does not require fluorescent oligonucleotide probes, and correctly identifies HFE genotypes.	11017930
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene in leukemia and lymphoma.	Leukemia & lymphoma	2002	3.09	The gene causing hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), HFE is an HLA class I-like gene with no known immunological function but indirectly related to the immune functions because of its role in iron transport. It is located 6.5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A. The most common mutation of HFE, C282Y, has a Celtic origin and most patients with HH are homozygous for it in Northern European populations. While there is an enormously increased risk for hepatocellular cancer in hemochromatosis that is attributed to the toxic effects of iron, the risk for extra-hepatic cancers is also increased slightly. Recent studies have found genetic associations between several cancers and C282Y but only in the presence of a particular allele of the transferrin receptor gene. This suggests that the increased cancer risk is more likely due to the effects of iron. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), however, there is a strong association of C282Y with a gender effect in two different Celtic populations. This association does not require homozygosity for C282Y or an interaction with the transferrin receptor gene, and is male-specific. The other HFE mutation H63D does not confer increased risk to childhood ALL. Acute myeloblastic leukemia and Hodgkin's disease in adults do not have an association with HFE. Its male-specificity, occurrence in childhood and the lack of a gene-dosage effect suggest that the C282Y association in childhood ALL may reflect the involvement of another HLA-linked gene in leukemia susceptibility.	12002748
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations in alcoholic and virus-related cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.	The American journal of gastroenterology	2002	0.5	The increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in hereditary hemochromatosis has been associated with cirrhosis and hepatic iron overload. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between HFE gene mutations (C282Y, H63D) and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with alcoholic and virus-related cirrhosis. Serum markers of iron status and HFE mutations were determined in 179 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and 98 patients with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis. A total of 43 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and 34 patients with virus-related cirrhosis had hepatocellular carcinoma. The control group consisted of 159 healthy bone marrow donors. No differences were found in the frequencies of mutations among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, those with virus-related cirrhosis, and the control subjects. However, nine (20.9%) of the 43 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, compared with six (4.4%) of the 136 patients without tumor (p = 0.002). This difference was not found in patients with virus-related cirrhosis, with or without hepatocellular carcinoma, or the H63D mutation. The transferrin saturation was the only serum iron marker the value of which was significantly higher among C282Y heterozygotes with alcoholic cirrhosis compared to those without mutation. The high frequency of heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis plus hepatocellular carcinoma suggests that the presence of this mutation could be associated with an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in these patients.	12003382
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	High prevalence of a screening-detected, HFE-unrelated, mild idiopathic iron overload in Northern Italy.	Haematologica	2002	6.67	In Italy, typical HFE mutations account for only 64% of the cases with overt hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), and a common HFE-unrelated disease was hypothesized. One thousand and fifty potential blood donors were screened by iron tests, C282Y and H63D HFE mutation analysis in a region in North Italy. Subjects with repeated fasting transferrin saturation of 45% or more and no secondary iron overload were defined as probands with idiopathic iron overload. To assess the inheritance of iron overload, relatives of probands were screened. The overall frequency of probands with idiopathic iron overload was 3.43% (95% confidence interval, 2.32 to 4.52). Of these, 8.4% had genotypes associated with HH (compound heterozygous for H63D/C282Y or homozygous for H63D HFE mutations), and 91.6% had atypical genotypes: 47.2% were heterozygous for C282Y or H63D HFE mutations, and 44.4% had wild type/wild type genotype. A family history of iron overload was proven in 33.3% of probands with atypical genotypes (1.04% of the overall population). Pedigree analysis excluded linkage of heterozygous HFE mutations with iron overload (cumulative lod score 2.41) and documented a recessive non-HLA-linked locus accounting for iron overload in wild type/wild type genotypes. None of the probands had clinical signs of iron accumulation; in males, serum ferritin positively correlated with age (r=0.63, p<0.01), and the regression model predicted a serum ferritin of 700 ng/mL at the age of 58. In Northern Italy an HFE-unrelated, mild idiopathic iron overload is highly prevalent. A recessive locus accounts for iron overload in at least 1.04% of the overall population.	12010659
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genes related to iron metabolism and susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease in Basque population.	Neurobiology of aging	2007	5.15	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common dementing disorder and presents with a progressive and irreversible cognitive decline of gradual onset. To date, several reports have involved iron in AD physiopathology. In this study, we have analysed TFC2 variant and HFE mutations (H63D and C282Y) in 211 AD patients and 167 controls recruited from an area of the Basque Country. Furthermore, we have studied APOE genotype as it is a well-known risk factor for AD. APOE epsilon 4 allele was associated with an increased risk of AD and an earlier age at onset, whereas no association was found between TFC2 or HFE C282Y mutation and disease susceptibility. The frequency of H63D mutation was higher in control population (29.9%) than in AD patients (18%), suggesting a protective role of this allele on AD either due to the presence of the mutation itself or through the effect of other related genes in the ancestral haplotype in which it is included.	17011669
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Autoimmune liver disease.	Current opinion in gastroenterology	2002	3.62	Autoimmune hepatitis is as virulent in the elderly as in the young, and initial treatment should be similar. Antiphospholipid antibodies should be sought in all patients with a history of fetal loss or arterial or venous thrombosis. The C282Y mutation in the HFE hemochromatosis gene occurs more commonly in autoimmune hepatitis than in normal subjects, but it is not associated with distinctive features. Children with autoimmune hepatitis may have abnormal cholangiogram results, but the syndrome of autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis does not affect immediate prognosis. Bile duct changes, including destructive cholangitis, can be incidental findings that have no clinical expression or therapeutic consequence. In South America, DRB1*1301 is associated with protracted hepatitis A virus infection which may enhance exposure to hepatic self-antigens in children. Interferon gamma-inducible protein 10 may be an important chemokine that promotes liver damage by attracting activated T cells. Transcripts of Fas ligand are abnormally increased in autoimmune hepatitis, and apoptotic dysfunction may contribute to disease progression. Pregnancy is not contraindicated in autoimmune hepatitis, and cyclosporine may be effective as first-line therapy.	17033304
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association Studies of HFE C282Y and H63D Variants with Oral Cancer Risk and Iron Homeostasis Among Whites and Blacks.	Cancers	2015	0.5	Polymorphisms in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene are associated with excessive iron absorption from the diet, and pro-oxidant effects of iron accumulation are thought to be a risk factor for several types of cancer. The C282Y (rs1800562) and H63D (rs1799945) polymorphisms were genotyped in 301 oral cancer cases and 437 controls and analyzed in relation to oral cancer risk, and serum iron biomarker levels from a subset of 130 subjects. Individuals with the C282Y allele had lower total iron binding capacity (TIBC) (321.2 ± 37.2 µg/dL vs. 397.7 ± 89.0 µg/dL, p = 0.007) and higher percent transferrin saturation (22.0 ± 8.7 vs. 35.6 ± 22.9, p = 0.023) than wild type individuals. Iron and ferritin levels approached significantly higher levels for the C282Y allele (p = 0.0632 and p = 0.0588, respectively). Iron biomarker levels were elevated by the C282Y allele, but neither (rs1800562) nor (rs1799945) was associated with oral cancer risk in blacks and whites.	26690219
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Heteroduplex analysis for the three common HFE variants: methodology, reliability and analysis of over 5000 requests for testing.	Journal of clinical pathology	2007	2.91	"""To describe the analysis of over 5300 patient samples for the HFE genotype. Blood samples received from hospitals in England, Wales and Ireland were analysed with a single, multiplex PCR using heteroduplex generators for the C282Y, H63D and S65C variants of the HFE gene. PCR products labelled with fluorescent dyes were analysed by capillary electrophoresis. Genotype frequencies were analysed according to the reasons given for testing. Analysis of 400 samples sent in duplicate revealed one error that was associated with reporting rather than the methodology. Of 5327 samples received, 1122 were for family testing, 2470 for diagnostic testing and in 1735 cases no reason was given. Overall, homozygosity for C282Y was found in 14% of samples received for family testing and in 16% of the remaining samples. Clinical indications such as """"liver disease"""" were of little predictive value for homozygosity for C282Y, but this increased if a raised serum ferritin concentration or transferrin saturation was indicated. When the diagnosis was iron overload, 39% of subjects tested were homozygous for C282Y. Compound heterozygosity (C282Y/H63D) was more frequent than in the general population but the frequency was not further increased in subjects for whom there was a diagnosis of iron overload. The frequencies of heterozygosity for H63D or S65C and homozygosity for H63D were not significantly increased in any group compared with the general population frequency. These results demonstrate the reliability of the methodology and confirm the difficulty of identifying genetic haemochromatosis purely on the basis of clinical suspicion that haemochromatosis may be responsible for liver disease, diabetes or arthritis."""	17079357
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepatic iron metabolism gene expression profiles in HFE associated hereditary hemochromatosis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Individuals with pathogenic mutations in HFE, hemojuvelin (HJV) and transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) have low levels of hepcidin, but little is known about the hepatic expression of these molecules in patients with physiological iron overload or HFE associated Hemochromatosis (HH). To examine the hepatic mRNA expression of iron homeostasis genes in patients with HH, physiological iron overload and healthy controls. Untreated C282Y homozygous HH patients (n=20) with elevated serum ferritin (SF) and patients with physiological iron overload (n=12) with positive hepatocellular iron staining and negative HFE mutation analysis were evaluated. The control cohort (n=10) had normal iron parameters, negative HFE mutation analysis and negative hepatocellular iron staining. Hepcidin, HJV (hemojuvelin), TfR2 (transferrin receptor 2), HFE, IL6 (interleukin 6) and ferroportin mRNA expression patterns were evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR. Physiological iron overload led to significantly upregulated hepcidin, HJV and ferroportin mRNA expression while TfR2 expression was not significantly different to controls. In contrast, HFE associated iron overload failed to induce hepcidin or HJV. TfR2 mRNA expression was significantly reduced when compared to controls. Ferroportin expression in HH was comparable to that found in physiological iron overload. Neither HFE nor IL6 expression was altered by variation in iron status. These findings suggest that patients with HH, in contrast to those with physiological iron overload, have a weakened TfR2 sensing mechanism that leads to the lack of induction of hepcidin and HJV. The C282Y HFE mutation does not appear to impede the hepatocellular iron export function of ferroportin.	17098454
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Roles of iron and HFE mutations on severity and response to therapy during retreatment of advanced chronic hepatitis C.	Gastroenterology	2006	18.19	Iron overload may cause or contribute to hepatic injury and fibrosis. Mutations in the HFE gene may influence development or progression of chronic liver disease by increasing iron stores or modulating immune responses. The aim of this work was to assess the influence of HFE mutations and serum and hepatic measures of iron status on baseline features and response to lead-in therapy in subjects with advanced chronic hepatitis C enrolled in the Hepatitis C Anti-viral Long-term Treatment to prevent Cirrhosis (HALT-C) Trial. Entry criteria included an Ishak fibrosis score >2 and lack of iron overload (Scheuer iron grade <3+) according to local study pathologists. All baseline biopsy specimens were rescored by consensus of study pathologists, and detailed assessment of stainable iron was performed. Hepatic iron concentrations were measured on portions of 144 liver biopsy specimens. A total of 1051 out of 1145 subjects agreed to HFE mutational testing (C282Y, H63D, S65C). Thirty-five percent carried at least one HFE gene mutation. There were no significant differences in the prevalence of HFE gene mutations among subjects with fibrosis (35.5%) versus cirrhosis (32.9%). Thirty-three percent of subjects had end-of-treatment and 16% sustained virologic responses. Presence of HFE mutations, in particular the H63D variation, was associated with increased end-of-treatment (40% vs 29%, P = .0078) and sustained virologic responses (20% with HFE mutation vs 14% sustained virologic response without HFE mutation; P = .009). Although HFE mutations (especially the most frequent H63D mutation) are associated with increased iron loading, they are also associated with increased sustained virologic responses in US patients with advanced chronic hepatitis C.	17101320
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic background of primary iron overload syndromes in Japan.	Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)	2006	0.5	The different prevalences of iron overload syndromes between Caucasians and Asians may be accounted for by the differences in genetic background. The major mutation of hemochromatosis in Celtic ancestry, C282Y of HFE, was reported in a Japanese patient. Five patients of 3 families with the hepatic transferrin receptor gene (TFR2)-linked hemochromatosis were found in different areas of Japan, suggesting that TFR2 is a major gene in Japanese people. Three patients with mutations in the hemojuvelin gene, HJV, showed also middle-age-onset hemochromatosis. A heterozygous mutation in the H ferritin gene, FTH1, was found in a family of 3 affected patients. Another autosomal dominant SLC40A1-linked hyperferritinemia (ferroportin disease) was found in 3 patients of 2 families. Two patients with hemochromatosis were free from any mutations in the genes investigated. In conclusion, the genetic backgrounds of Japanese patients with primary iron overload syndromes were partially clarified, showing some phenotype-genotype correlations.	17106152
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association of HFE and TMPRSS6 genetic variants with iron and erythrocyte parameters is only in part dependent on serum hepcidin concentrations.	Journal of medical genetics	2011	5.65	Hepcidin is the main regulator of iron homeostasis: inappropriate production of hepcidin results in iron overload or iron deficiency and anaemia. To study variation of serum hepcidin concentration in a normal population. Hepcidin showed age and sex dependent variations that correlated with ferritin but not with serum iron and transferrin saturation. The size of the study population was underpowered to find genome wide significant associations with hepcidin concentrations but it allowed to show that association with serum iron, transferrin saturation and erythrocyte traits of common DNA variants in HFE (rs1800562) and TMPRSS6 (rs855791) genes is not exclusively dependent on hepcidin values. When multiple interactions between environmental factors, the iron parameters and hepcidin were taken into account, the HFE variant, and to lesser extent the TMPRSS6 variant, were associated with ferritin and with hepcidin normalised to ferritin (the hepcidin/ferritin ratio). The results suggest a mutual control of serum hepcidin and ferritin concentrations, a mechanism relevant to the pathophysiology of HFE haemochromatosis, and demonstrate that the HFE rs1800562 C282Y variant exerts a direct pleiotropic effect on the iron parameters, in part independent of hepcidin.	21785125
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Role of HFE gene mutations on developing iron overload in beta-thalassaemia carriers in Egypt.	Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit	2011	0.5	A case-control study aimed to determine the prevalence of C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations of the HFE gene in beta-thalassaemia carriers and investigate their influence on iron absorption. A total of 41 beta-thalassaemia carriers and 40 control subjects without haemoglobinopathies were screened for the C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment-length polymorphism. The iron status in these subjects was studied and correlated with the HFE gene mutations. H63D, S65C and C282Y allele frequencies were 30.5%, 13.4% and 7.3% respectively in beta-thalassaemia carriers and 10.0%, 2.5% and 0.0% respectively in the control group. Compound heterozygosis was found in 10 carriers (24.4%). The transferrin saturation level was high in compound heterozygote cases. Our study has shown that the HFEgene mutations are common in Egypt among beta-thalassaemia carriers compared with normal controls.	21796974
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The effect of the hemochromatosis (HFE) genotype on lead load and iron metabolism among lead smelter workers.	PloS one	2014	3.06	Both an excess of toxic lead (Pb) and an essential iron disorder have been implicated in many diseases and public health problems. Iron metabolism genes, such as the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene, have been reported to be modifiers for lead absorption and storage. However, the HFE gene studies among the Asian population with occupationally high lead exposure are lacking. To explore the modifying effects of the HFE genotype (wild-type, H63D variant and C282Y variant) on the Pb load and iron metabolism among Asian Pb-workers with high occupational exposure. Seven hundred and seventy-one employees from a lead smelter manufacturing company were tested to determine their Pb intoxication parameters, iron metabolic indexes and identify the HFE genotype. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted. Forty-five H63D variant carriers and no C282Y variant carrier were found among the 771 subjects. Compared with subjects with the wild-type genotype, H63D variant carriers had higher blood lead levels, even after controlling for factors such as age, sex, marriage, education, smoking and lead exposure levels. Multivariate analyses also showed that the H63D genotype modifies the associations between the blood lead levels and the body iron burden/transferrin. No C282Y variant was found in this Asian population. The H63D genotype modified the association between the lead and iron metabolism such that increased blood lead is associated with a higher body iron content or a lower transferrin in the H63D variant. It is indicated that H63D variant carriers may be a potentially highly vulnerable sub-population if they are exposed to high lead levels occupationally.	24988074
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The WT hemochromatosis protein HFE inhibits CD8⁺ T-lymphocyte activation.	European journal of immunology	2014	4.18	MHC class I (MHC I) antigen presentation is a ubiquitous process by which cells present endogenous proteins to CD8(+) T lymphocytes during immune surveillance and response. Hereditary hemochromatosis protein, HFE, is involved in cellular iron uptake but, while structurally homologous to MHC I, is unable to bind peptides. However, increasing evidence suggests a role for HFE in the immune system. Here, we investigated the impact of HFE on CD8(+) T-lymphocyte activation. Using transient HFE transfection assays in a model of APCs, we show that WT HFE (HFEWT ), but not C282Y-mutated HFE, inhibits secretion of MIP-1β from antigen-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes. HFEWT expression also resulted in major decreases in CD8(+) T-lymphocyte activation as measured by 4-1BB expression. We further demonstrate that inhibition of CD8(+) T-lymphocyte activation was independent of MHC I surface levels, β2-m competition, HFE interaction with transferrin receptor, antigen origin, or epitope affinity. Finally, we identified the α1-2 domains of HFEWT as being responsible for inhibiting CD8(+) T-lymphocyte activation. Our data imply a new role for HFEWT in altering CD8(+) T-lymphocyte reactivity, which could modulate antigen immunogenicity.	24643698
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Primary osteoarthritis in the ankle joint is associated with finger metacarpophalangeal osteoarthritis and the H63D mutation in the HFE gene: evidence for a hemochromatosis-like polyarticular osteoarthritis phenotype.	Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases	2006	0.5	Osteoarthritis (OA) can occur in the ankle joint. It also occurs in an appreciable proportion of subjects with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). Might these conditions have common genetic characteristics? The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that HFE gene mutations are associated with primary osteoarthritis in the ankle joint. Consecutive referred patients who had primary or secondary (posttraumatic) OA of the ankle joint were assessed by a single rheumatologist and had a full physical and joint examination. Plain x-rays of the ankle joint, other clinically involved osteoarthritic joints, iron studies, HFE genotyping, and Hb electrophoresis were performed. The significance of differences was evaluated by 2-tailed Fisher exact test. Fourteen patients met the inclusion criteria for primary ankle OA and 6 met the criteria for secondary ankle OA. One of the 14 had had a previous subtalar joint fusion and was excluded. Among the remaining 13, 7 had OA in the index and/or middle finger metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP2,3 OA) with radiologic features similar to those found in hemochromatotic arthropathy (HA). Furthermore, 11 of the 13 had at least one HFE mutation, one subject in this group was homozygous for H63D, one was compound heterozygous for C282Y and S65C, and one was compound heterozygous for H63D and S65C. Eight were heterozygous for H63D. The 13 subjects were compared with the 6 secondary ankle OA subjects and with a previously studied population cohort (n = 3011) from the town of Busselton in whom HFE genotyping had been performed. A statistically significant increase in the frequency of HFE gene mutations was observed in the group with primary OA of the ankle joint compared with that with secondary ankle joint OA (P = 0.0095) and compared with the Busselton cohort (P = 0.0008). Furthermore, a statistically significant association between finger MCP joint OA and primary ankle joint OA was observed (P = 0.0436). Iron studies were normal in the 13 primary and 6 secondary ankle OA subjects. None of the subjects with ankle OA had clinical signs of hemochromatosis or abnormal liver function tests. A strong and statistically significant association was observed between HFE gene mutations and primary OA in the ankle joint. The frequent presence of MCP2,3 OA in these patients suggests the existence of a type 2 polyarticular OA phenotype that closely resembles the arthropathy of HH and which appears to be clinically differentiable from type 1 OA or nodal generalized OA (NGOA). HFE gene mutations may be a marker for the type 2 polyarticular OA phenotype and a clue to OA pathogenesis.	16755236
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The CD8+ T-lymphocyte profile as a modifier of iron overload in HFE hemochromatosis: an update of clinical and immunological data from 70 C282Y homozygous subjects.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a clinically heterogeneous disease. Among other factors, the individual immunological profile of CD8+ T-lymphocytes has been described to influence the severity of iron overload, with low numbers being negatively correlated with the total amount of body iron stored. With the objective of testing the modifier effect of the individual CD8+ T-lymphocyte profile on the levels of iron stores with age in HH, we reviewed the clinical and immunological data from a group of well-characterized C282Y homozygous HH subjects, regularly followed-up for a period of 20 years. A total of 70 subjects were analyzed. Sixty-four were adults (> or = 18 years): 42 males (mean age 47 +/- 14; range 22-75 years) and 22 females (mean age 46 +/- 14; range 19-65 years). Six were younger than 18 years, 5 males (mean age 9 +/- 4; range 5-14 years) and 1 female (15 years). The characterization of subjects included measurements, at diagnosis, of the iron parameters, transferrin saturation (TfSat) and serum ferritin, quantification of total body iron stores (TBIS) removed by phlebotomies, presence of associated clinical manifestations, and the T-cell immunophenotype (CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes) determined by flow cytometry. In general, statistically significant lower values of TfSat (67 +/- 17% vs. 89 +/- 14%, P = 0.0006) and ferritin levels (58 +/- 9 vs. 949 +/- 233 ng/ml, P = 0.02) were found in the young subjects in comparison to adults. After the age of 18, however, no further effect of age was significantly found on the biochemical iron parameters either in males or females. A modifier effect of the individual CD8+ T-lymphocyte profile on the association between iron stores and age was demonstrated by multiple regression analysis, where a significant correlation between TBIS and age was found only in males with low (< or = 0.41 x 10(6)/ml) CD8+ T-cell numbers (R2 = 0.43, P < 0.0001). In conclusion, in the present population of C282Y homozygous subjects, the CD8+ T-lymphocyte profile could be considered a modifier of the iron overload with increasing age in males, with low numbers predicting a severe outcome.	16762569
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical and genetic determinants of anthracycline-induced cardiac iron accumulation.	International journal of cardiology	2012	4.64	The involvement of iron in anthracycline cardiotoxicity is supported by extensive experimental data, and by the preventive efficacy of dexrazoxane, an iron chelator. However, no clinical evidence of anthracycline-induced cardiac iron accumulation is available and the influence of previous iron overload or of genetic factors in human-induced heart disease is largely unknown. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that anthracyclines increase iron heart concentration and that HFE genotype modulates this iron deposit. We retrospectively evaluated cardiac events, cardiac iron and HFE genotype in 97 consecutive necropsies from patients with solid and hematological neoplasms. Heart and liver iron concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. HFE gene mutations (C282Y and H63D) linked to hereditary hemochromatosis were analyzed by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) genotyping. Heart iron concentration was increased in cases treated with a cumulative doxorubicin dose greater than 200mg/m(2) (490 vs 240 μg/g; p=0.01), independently of liver iron load or transfusion history. HFE mutated haplotypes 282C/63D (p=0.049) and 282Y/63H (p=0.027) were associated to higher cardiac iron deposits. The haplotype C282Y-Y/H63D-H interacted with anthracyclines for increasing cardiac iron load. In a multivariate linear regression analysis both HFE genotypes and anthracyclines contributed to heart iron concentration (R(2)=0.284). Our data support the occurrence of an HFE-modulated heart iron accumulation in individuals treated with anthracyclines, independently of systemic iron load. If prospectively confirmed, iron-related parameters might be useful as predictive factors for anthracycline cardiotoxicity.	20974500
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Natural history of HFE simple heterozygosity for C282Y and H63D: a prospective 12-year study.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2015	3.32	The risk of hemochromatosis-related morbidity for HFE simple heterozygosity for either the C282Y or H63D substitutions in the HFE protein was assessed using a prospective community-based cohort study. HFE genotypes were measured for 31,192 persons of northern European descent, aged between 40 and 69 years when recruited to the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, and subjects were followed for an average of 12 years. For a random sample of 1438 participants stratified according to HFE genotype, two sets of biochemical iron indices performed 12 years apart and, at follow-up only, the presence/absence of six disease features associated with hereditary hemochromatosis were obtained. Summary data for 257 (139 female) C282Y simple heterozygotes and 123 (74 female) H63D simple heterozygotes were compared with 330 (181 female) controls with neither HFE mutation. At baseline, mean transferrin saturation (TS) (95% confidence interval) and prevalence of TS > 55% were 35.14% (33.25, 37.04) and 3/112 (3%), 33.03% (29.9, 36.15) and 0/39 (0%), and 29.67% (27.93, 31.4) and 3/135 (2%) for C282Y, H63D and wild-type male participants, respectively. At follow-up, mean TS levels remained similar to baseline levels for both men and women irrespective of simple heterozygosity for either mutation. No HFE C282Y or H63D simple heterozygotes had documented iron overload (based on hepatic iron measures or serum ferritin greater than 1000 mg/L at baseline with documented therapeutic venesection). No documented iron overload was observed for HFE simple heterozygotes for either C282Y or H63D, and morbidity for both HFE simple heterozygote groups was similar to that of HFE wild-type participants.	25311314
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Predicting C282Y homozygote genotype for hemochromatosis using serum ferritin and transferrin saturation values from 44,809 participants of the HEIRS study.	Canadian journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	2014	0.5	The simultaneous interpretation of serum ferritin level and transferrin saturation has been used as a clinical guide to diagnose genetic hemochromatosis. The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study screened 101,168 North American participants for serum ferritin level and transferrin saturation, and C282Y genotyping for the HFE gene. Logistic regression involving a subsample of Caucasians (n=44,809) was used to predict individual probabilities of HFE C282Y homozygosity using serum ferritin and transferrin saturation values. Men (n=17,323) and women (n=27,486) were analyzed separately. Regression equations were evaluated using area under the curve from ROC analysis and variance explained by Nagelkerke's pseudo R-squared. An Android smartphone App and website application were developed to provide physicians with easy access to predicting C282Y homozygosity of the HFE gene. The logistic equation had an area under the ROC curve of 0.91 for men and 0.89 for women. The pseudo R-squared was 0.44 for men and 0.34 for women. An example analysis was a Caucasian man with a transferrin saturation of 50% and a ferritin level of 500 µg⁄L, who had a 1.3% (95% CI 1.1% to 8.8%) probability of being a C282Y homozygote. A large primary care-based sample of 44,809 participants contributed to the development of a new computer⁄smartphone tool that predicts the probability of being a C282Y homozygote of the HFE gene from serum ferritin and transferrin saturation values.	25314357
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Consequences of expressing mutants of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) into a human neuronal cell line lacking endogenous HFE.	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	2007	5.3	HFE mutations have traditionally been associated with the iron overload disorder known as hemochromatosis. Recently, it has become clear that the two most common mutations in the HFE gene, H63D and C282Y, may be genetic modifiers for risk of neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, respectively. We developed human neuroblastoma stable cell lines that express either wild-type (WT) or mutant HFE to determine the cellular consequences of the mutant forms of HFE. The presence of the C282Y mutation was associated with relatively higher labile iron pool and iron regulatory protein activity than WT or H63D HFE. Targeted gene arrays revealed that the signal transduction pathway was up-regulated in the C282Y cells. H63D cells had higher levels of lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and lower mitochondrial membrane potential, suggesting higher baseline stress. This cell line was also more vulnerable to exposure to oxidative stress agents and more responsive to iron chelation than the C282Y cells. These data demonstrate that the different mutations in the HFE gene have unique effects on the cells and provide insights into how the different mutations may have different clinical consequences. The results also raise multiple novel questions for future study about the function of the HFE protein.	17194693
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Diagnosis and therapy of inheritable liver diseases: hemochromatisis, Wilson's disease and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency].	Praxis	2005	0.5	The recent years have seen significant progress in the area of genetically determined liver diseases. For hereditary hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency the underlying genetic defects have been described and well characterized. Although a direct relationship between genetic defect and disease manifestation exists genetic test only have a limited diagnostic usefulness which requires exact knowledge of the underlying molecular pathology. The classical C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene only show a penetrance of 10-20% in hemochromatosis and are not useful for population screening. Genetic screening for ATP7B (Wilson's disease) and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency variants is limited by the existence of a plethora of individual mutations. Genetic tests are mainly restricted to the counseling of families in whom these diseases are present. Foremost the diagnosis of the three diseases is reached by clinical, biochemical and in some instances also histological means which are supplemented and confirmed by the use of appropriate genetic tests.	15719801
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of HFE H63D, S65C, and C282Y mutations in patients with iron overload and controls from Toledo, Spain.	Genetic testing	2004	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a defective iron absorption. C282Y is the most frequent HFE gene mutation causing HH in Northern European populations and their descendants. However, two other mutations, H63D and S65C, have been described as pathogenic changes. In this study, we have tried to evaluate the frequency of these three mutations in our community. Eighty-three patients with clinical and/or biochemical features of hemochromatosis and 150 controls were screened for H63D, S65C, and C282Y mutations using a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based strategy. In contrast to previous studies, 7% of the patients were homozygous for C282Y mutation. The remaining patients were 20% H63D homozygous, 10% H63D/C282Y compound heterozygous, 1% H63D/S65C compound heterozygous, 22% H63D heterozygous, 2% C282Y heterozygous, 2% S65C heterozygous, and 36% of patients lacked any of the three mutations studied, despite the fact that they showed clinical/biochemical features of hemochromatosis. We observed a high frequency of the H63D mutation in both the control group and patients, whereas the main genotypes implicated in HH in our series were H63D homozygous and H63D/C282Y compound heterozygous. We propose that the H63D mutation be analyzed in HH patients from our geographic area. Moreover, further studies are needed to elucidate the role of this mutation in the development of HH and the genetic, environmental or other factors that affect the genotype-phenotype correlation between H63D and hemochromatosis.	15727249
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The penetrance of hereditary hemochromatosis.	Best practice & research. Clinical haematology	2005	0.5	Since its original description as a rare disease of iron overload resulting in liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and bronzing of the skin ('bronze diabetes'), hereditary hemochromatosis has undergone several redefinitions leading to widely varying estimates of its prevalence. Over the last decade, the finding of a relatively high prevalence of the C282Y polymorphism of the HFE gene associated with hemochromatosis in Northern European populations suggested that the disease may be much more common than previously thought. However, several large population-based studies have now shown that the penetrance of the C282Y/C282Y genotype is very low, indicating that C282Y homozygosity is a necessary but not sufficient factor in causation of the disease. Studies are now focusing on other genetic and environmental factors, including alcohol, that may contribute to differential expression of C282Y homozygosity.	15737885
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Human leukocyte antigen haplotypes and HFE mutations in Spanish hereditary hemochromatosis and sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2005	3.32	It has been postulated that the HFE C282Y mutation (linked to human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-A3-B7 haplotype) is not only responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis; HLA class I alleles would also contribute to the disease pathogenesis. In addition, H63D mutation linked to HLA-A29-B44 would also be pathogenetic, particularly in the Mediterranean Basin and throughout the world. However, sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda (s-PCT) has also been linked to these HFE mutations. In the present work, we have studied HFE mutations and HLA genes to test these hypotheses. C282Y and H63D mutations together with HLA genetic typing have been performed in Spanish hereditary hemochromatosis (n = 98) and PCT (n = 63) patients. The etiologic fraction (delta) has been used to determine the absolute strongest gene linkage to both diseases. The Spanish frequent HLA-A29-B44 haplotype is not significantly associated to the H63D mutations in hereditary hemochromatosis patients (although it is found more frequently in patients than in controls). Sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda patients do not show a significant association to H63D mutations, although it is also more frequent than in controls; however, compound H63D/C282Y subjects seem to bear a significant risk to s-PCT. Allelic C282Y (and not H63D) frequencies show a significant association with s-PCT. The postulated additional risk of hereditary hemochromatosis given by class I HLA antigens may be secondary to the HFE gene linkage disequilibrium with certain class I alleles or to the existence of other neighboring genetic pathogenetic factors in our Spanish sample.	15740492
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia--type II (CDA-II) in 3 siblings with long-term follow up and iron overload].	Acta medica (Hradec Kralove). Supplementum	2004	0.5	"""The diagnosis of congenital dyserythropioetic anemia-type II (CDA-II) was established in 1974 in three siblings aged 20, 18 and 5 years, respectively. Liver biopsy performed in two elder siblings on admission revealed liver siderosis. Anemia showing haemolytic component with destruction of erythrocytes in the spleen was corrected after splenectomy. Increased number of erythrocytes showing """"the double membrane phenomenon"""" was found in the peripheral blood after splenectomy. All three siblings developed cholecystolithiasis with choledocholithiasis and obstructive jaundice in two of them. Two patients at the age of 49 and 34 years (the third died in an accident at the age of 40 years) developed 29 years after the diagnosis of CDA-II had been established signs of iron overload with transferin saturation 99%, serum ferritin 1450.4 microg/l and 1131.7 microg/l respectively, and hepatic iron concentration (dry weight) 14,843 microg/g and 15,415 microg/g (norm 70-1400 microg/g) respectively. No mutations of HFE gene (C282Y and H63D) were found. Liver biopsy showed heavy accumulation of hemosiderin in hepatocytes and reticuloendothelial cells. The structure of the liver tissue was not changed, only mild fibrosis in portal area was present in the older patient. Because of iron overload therapy with phlebotomy once monthly (400 ml) has been started in both patients. In peripheral blood films excess of Pappenheimer bodies was found."""	15745056
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Is serum hepcidin causative in hemochromatosis? Novel analysis from a liver transplant with hemochromatosis.	Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie	2008	0.5	Hepcidin is a circulating hepatic hormone that regulates iron balance. It has been speculated that hepcidin insufficiency or dysregulation may be the primary defect in genetic hemochromatosis. A 62-year-old woman underwent elective liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis C cirrhosis. Genetic testing for hemochromatosis was subsequently performed on the donor and recipient. Liver iron concentration was measured in the donated liver at the time of transplantation, and at day 2 and day 652 post-transplant. Serum hepcidin was measured at day 935 in the recipient and in three other liver transplant recipients. The donor was discovered to have significant iron overload without fibrosis, with a liver iron concentration of 326 micromol/g (normal is 0 micromol/g to 35 micromol/g). Genetic testing confirmed that the 89-year-old female donor was a typical C282Y homozygote for hemochromatosis. The recipient did not carry either the C282Y or the H63D mutation of the HFE gene for hemochromatosis. Liver biopsy was performed on the recipient on day 2 and day 652 post-transplant; the liver iron concentrations were 333 micromol/g and 253 micromol/g, respectively. Serum hepcidin in the recipient was elevated at 111 ng/mL compared with that of the three other ambulatory liver transplant recipients (66 ng/mL, 76 ng/mL and 81 ng/mL). The liver transplant recipient described in the present report demonstrated a slight decrease in liver iron concentration over a 1.8-year follow-up period without specific therapy. Hepcidin insufficiency as a primary cause of genetic hemochromatosis seems unlikely based on the clinical profile of the present patient and the hepcidin measurements.	18925311
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for hemochromatosis and iron overload: satisfaction with results notification and understanding of mailed results in unaffected participants of the HEIRS study.	Genetic testing	2008	0.5	"""The purpose of this study was to assess the level of satisfaction and understanding of test results, by a sample of non-C282Y homozygous participants in the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening (HEIRS) study, who received serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation (TS), and HFE gene test results by mail. Approximately 1 month after receiving test results by mail, participants were surveyed about understanding of and satisfaction with results notification. Overall, participants were satisfied with receiving test results by mail. Participants receiving results with one or two HFE mutations or TS and/or SF levels outside the normal range (an """"alert value"""") were less likely to be satisfied with this method of notification. Participants with normal HFE test results understood their results and recommendations better than those with one or two mutations. Although all participants received results letters in their native language, English-speaking participants had higher mean understanding scores than Mandarin, Vietnamese, or Spanish-speaking participants. Participants were satisfied with receiving test results by mail. However, the level of understanding of the results was not sufficient for this mode of results notification to stand alone, especially for non-English speaking participants, and all participants with one or more test results outside the normal range."""	18939938
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Unique frequencies of HFE gene variants in Roma/Gypsies.	Journal of applied genetics	2012	1.93	The aim of this study was to assess the frequencies of three hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations in ethnic Roma/Gypsies in Slovakia. A cohort of 367 individuals representing general population and not preselected for health status was genotyped by TaqMan real-time PCR assay for C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in HFE gene. A unique genetic profile was revealed: C282Y is found in the highest frequency of all Central European countries (4.90%), while the frequency of H63D mutation (4.09%) is lower than any reported in Europe so far. S65C mutation was not present in the cohort. These mutation frequencies can be explained rather by gene influx and genetic isolation than by genetic inheritance from a former Roma/Gypsy homeland.	22354660
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The prognostic role of hemochromatosis H63D allele in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	Annals of hematology	2012	3.02	Iron overload is considered as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. The presence of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations might exacerbate iron toxicity in the post-transplant setting. This prospective study was planned to evaluate the genetic spectrum of HFE mutations in Turkish patients undergoing HSCT and the impact of HFE genotype on transplant morbidity and mortality. HFE genotypes of 102 patients [median age, 27.5 years (16-64 years); male/female, 73:29], who underwent allogeneic HSCT, were analyzed. Twenty-two patients were heterozygous and 1 patient was homozygous for the H63D mutation, while the C282Y mutation was observed in none of our patients. The frequency of invasive fungal infections (IFI) was significantly higher in H63D-mutated patients (p=0.004). H63D mutation was identified as an independent risk factor for the development of IFI (p=0.006, OR=0.554, SE=0.208), without an impact on overall survival and transplant-related mortality. The multifactorial iron-overloaded state in HSCT recipients might affect the phenotypic expression of HFE mutations and alter the severity of clinical presentation. The impact of HFE genotype on iron parameters and transplant-related morbidity and mortality should be validated with further studies.	22362121
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Validation of an unlabeled probe melting analysis assay combined with high-throughput extractions for genotyping of the most common variants in HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis, C282Y, H63D, and S65C.	Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers	2012	1.3	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism, characterized by high absorption of iron by the gastrointestinal tract leading to a toxic accumulation of iron in various organs and impaired organ function. Three variants in the HFE gene (p.C282Y, p.H63D, and p.S65C) are commonly associated with the development of the disease. Of these, p.C282Y homozygotes are at the highest risk. Compound heterozygotes of p.C282Y along with p.H63D or p.S65C have reduced penetrance. Furthermore, p.H63D homozygotes are not at an increased risk and little is known about the risk associated with homozygocity for p.S65C. Our current clinical assay for the three common HFE variants utilizes the LightCycler platform and paired probes employing fluorescent resonance energy transfer. To increase throughput and decrease costs, we developed a method whereby automated extraction was combined with unlabeled probes and differential melt profiles to detect these variants using the LightCycler 480 instrument. Using this approach, 43 samples extracted with three different extraction platforms were correctly genotyped. These data demonstrate that the newly developed assay to genotype the HFE mutations p.C282Y, p.H63D, and p.S65C, combined with high-throughput extraction platforms, is accurate and reproducible and represents an alternative to previously described tests.	22364140
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Influence of HFE gene polymorphism on the progression and treatment of chronic hepatitis C.	Journal of viral hepatitis	2004	4.18	We analysed liver histology findings in a large cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis C and in roughly half of them their response to interferon-alpha-based on iron parameters and HFE status. Histological activity and virological response to antiviral therapy (n = 146) were analysed in 273 immunocompetent and nonalcoholic patients with chronic hepatitis C, in terms of serum iron load, intrahepatic iron load (n = 110) and HFE mutations. Patients who were heterozygous for the C282Y and H63D mutations exhibited higher iron serum parameters than subjects without these mutations. The intrahepatic iron load was higher in H63D patients only. No association was observed between HFE mutations and histological activity. Increased iron parameters were associated with liver disease severity by univariate analysis only. Genotype 1 and ferritinaemia were associated with a poor response to antiviral therapy, whereas the H63D mutation emerged as a positive predictive factor for end of treatment and sustained antiviral response. Therefore, in chronic hepatitis C patients serum and intrahepatic iron levels were weakly correlated with histological activity, while HFE mutations were not. As for the response to interferon-alpha, elevated ferritinaemia constituted a negative predictive factor whereas the H63D mutation was a positive one. The H63D mutation might form part of an immunogenetic profile influencing the response to interferon therapy.	14996353
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Countries of ancestry reported by hemochromatosis probands and control subjects in central Alabama.	Ethnicity & disease	2004	1.01	"""We sought to evaluate the hypothesis that the relatively high HFE C282Y allele frequency in White persons in central Alabama (0.0896) is due to a predominance of persons of Irish and Scots descent, and is not attributable to Native American ancestry common in this geographic area. Eighty evaluable hemochromatosis probands with C282Y homozygosity and 319 White controls reported countries of ancestry of their grandparents. Frequencies of country of ancestry reports were tabulated. The reports were also converted to scores that reflect proportional countries of ancestry in individuals. Using the scores, we computed aggregate country of ancestry indices as estimates of group ancestry composition. Results were compared to those of European populations with C282Y allele frequencies >0.0800. The respective frequencies of """"British Isles"""" and Scotland reports were significantly greater in hemochromatosis probands than in controls. The respective frequencies of """"Europe Not British Isles,"""" Italy, and Poland reports were significantly greater in controls. Aggregate """"British Isles"""" and Scotland indices were significantly greater in hemochromatosis probands. The """"Europe Not British Isles"""" index was significantly greater in controls. Approximately one-quarter of hemochromatosis probands and controls reported """"Native American"""" ancestry; the corresponding country of ancestry index was not significantly different in probands and controls. C282Y frequencies >0.0800 were reported from England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, and Denmark. The present results indicate that hemochromatosis probands with C282Y homozygosity in central Alabama report significantly different countries of ancestry than control subjects. It is unlikely that Native American ancestry is associated with an enrichment of hemochromatosis among adult probands. British Isles ancestry, not exclusively Irish and Scots ancestries, likely accounts for the relatively high C282Y frequency in White persons in central Alabama."""	15002926
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Haplotyping of wild type and I278T alleles of the human cystathionine beta-synthase gene based on a cluster of novel SNPs in IVS12.	Human mutation	2001	5.09	Homocystinuria is most frequently due to deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS). We identified IVS12 as a polymorphism hot spot of the human CBS gene and report five novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): g.13514G>A, g.13617A>G, g.13715C>T, g.13800G>A, and g.13904C>T. Analyzing 50 control DNA samples of unaffected and unrelated subjects of German origin the observed frequencies of heterozygosity were 0.02, 0.36, 0.18, 0.36, and 0.36, respectively. These polymorphic markers were combined into four distinct IVS12-haplotypes A1, A2, B1, and B2, revealing frequencies of 0.75, 0.01, 0.15, and 0.09, respectively, with an observed overall frequency of heterozygosity at 0.38. This haplotype system and the SNP c.699 were employed in the analysis of ten alleles affected by the most prevalent CBS mutation, c.833T>C (exon 8; I278T). We found that the I278T alleles segregate with at least two distinct haplotypes characterized by upstream and downstream polymorphic sites instead of sharing a common ancestral haplotype. This was a remarkable finding even in patients with very similar ethnic background. The novel haplotype system may facilitate future studies on the evolution of the CBS gene and might be suited for genotyping of families affected by homocystinuria.	11295835
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis and iron therapy of Restless Legs Syndrome.	Sleep medicine	2001	3.34	Restless legs syndrome (RLS) occurs in some persons with iron deficiency, and some persons with RLS benefit from oral iron therapy. Approximately one in 200 persons of northern European ancestry have hemochromatosis attributable to inheritance of two common mutations of the hemochromatosis-associated HFE gene on chromosome 6. We evaluated and treated a 46-year-old man with RLS who was diagnosed as having hemochromatosis after he developed new symptoms associated with taking iron therapy for RLS. He had transferrin saturation 88%, serum ferritin 658 ng/ml, and C282Y homozygosity. Therapeutic phlebotomy of one unit of blood (450-500 ml) weekly (total 24 units) relieved his non-RLS symptoms, caused RLS symptoms to occur more frequently, and was associated with transient fatigue and mild dependent edema. His sister, who also has RLS, was subsequently diagnosed as having hemochromatosis. We conclude that serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels should be measured before initiation of iron therapy of RLS. Patients with a history of iron deficiency or low serum iron parameters should undergo evaluation for iron deficiency; patients who have histories suggestive of hemochromatosis or iron overload or elevated pre-treatment transferrin saturation or serum ferritin levels should undergo evaluation to determine the cause of these abnormalities before they are treated with iron. In all persons with RLS treated with oral iron, serum iron parameters should be re-measured once or twice yearly during therapy.	11311689
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	New mutations inactivating transferrin receptor 2 in hemochromatosis type 3.	Blood	2001	11.84	Hereditary hemochromatosis usually results from C282Y homozygosity in the HFE gene on chromosome 6p. Recently, a new type of hemochromatosis (HFE3) has been characterized in 2 unrelated Italian families with a disorder linked to 7q. Patients with HFE3 have transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) inactivated by a homozygous nonsense mutation (Y250X). Here the identification of 2 new TFR2 mutations is reported. In a large inbred family from Campania, a frameshift mutation (84-88 insC) in exon 2 that causes a premature stop codon (E60X) is identified. In a single patient with nonfamilial hemochromatosis, a T-->A transversion (T515A), which causes a Methionine-->Lysine substitution at position 172 of the protein (M172K), has been characterized. TFR2 gene gives origin to 2 alternatively spliced transcripts-the alpha-transcript, which may encode a transmembrane protein, and the beta-transcript, a shorter, possibly intracellular variant. Based on their positions, the effects of the identified mutations on the 2 TFR2 forms are expected to differ. Y250X inactivates both transcripts, whereas E60X inactivates only the alpha-form. M172K has a complex effect: it causes a missense in the alpha-form, but it may also prevent the beta-form production because it affects its putative initiation codon. Analysis of the clinical phenotype of 13 HFE3 homozygotes characterized at the molecular level has shown a variable severity, from nonexpressing patients to severe clinical complications. The identification of new mutations of TFR2 confirms that this gene is associated with iron overload and offers a tool for molecular diagnosis in patients without HFE mutations.	11313241
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron transport in a lymphoid cell line with the hemochromatosis C282Y mutation.	Blood	2001	11.84	The gene for hemochromatosis (HFE) is expressed in a variety of cells, including those not thought to be affected by this disease. The impact of HFE on iron transport was examined in B-lymphoid cell lines developed from a patient with hemochromatosis with the HFE C282Y mutation (C282Y cells) and an individual with the wild-type HFE gene (WT cells). Whereas both cell lines expressed HFE protein, C282Y cells displayed less HFE protein at the cell surface. Transferrin receptor (TfR) number was 2- to 3-fold greater in WT cells than in C282Y cells, while TfR affinity for transferrin (Tf) was slightly lower in C282Y cells. TfR distribution between intracellular and cell-surface compartments was similar in both cell lines. Iron uptake per cell was greater in WT cells but was not increased proportional to TfR number. When considered relative to cell-surface TfR number, however, iron uptake and Tf internalization were actually greater in C282Y cells. Surprisingly, Tf-independent iron uptake was also significantly greater in C282Y cells than in WT cells. The ferritin content of C282Y cells was approximately 40% that of WT cells. Exposure of cells to pro-oxidant conditions in culture led to a greater inhibition of proliferation in C282Y cells than in WT cells. Our results indicate that in this B-lymphoid cell line, the HFE C282Y mutation affects both Tf-dependent and -independent iron uptake and enhances cell sensitivity to oxidative stress. The role of HFE in iron uptake by B cells may extend beyond its known interaction with the TfR.	11313265
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Old and new iron parameters in iron metabolism and diagnostics].	Therapeutische Umschau. Revue therapeutique	2008	0.5	Iron is an element which is essential to life but also potentially toxic. Therefore, clever mechanisms exist in the human body for uptake, transport and storage of iron. Hepcidin, which seems to be the master protein for regulation of intestinal iron absorption, is known for a short time. The expression of hepcidin is not only influenced by iron levels but also by mediators of inflammation and growth factors of erythropoiesis. Hence hepcidin plays also a crucial role in the development of anemia of chronic disease and iron overload due to ineffective erythropoiesis. Serum ferritin is a reliable parameter to estimate the storage iron. It is an acute phase protein which is elevated during infections and inflammations, though. In these situations, measurement of soluble transferrin receptors is a useful tool to differentiate between iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease. Newer parameters as erythrocyte zink protoporphyrin or percentage of hypochromic erythrocytes (%HYPO) are suited to detect a functional iron deficiency. Early diagnosis of iron overload is essential to prevent organ damage. Serum ferritin and transferrin are useful parameters to screen for iron overload. If no clear reason for a secondary iron overload can be found, the search for a hereditary haemochromatosis is recommended. Most of these hereditary haemochromatoses are a result of mutations in the HFE gene (homozygous state for Cys282Tyr or compound heterozygosity for Cys282Tyr/ His63Asp) which can be detected by PCR technique. Liver biopsy is still the gold standard for quantification of storage iron. However, a method of increasing importance for quantification of iron overload is magnetic resonance imaging with new approaches as for example T2*.	18791966
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Variants in iron metabolism genes predict higher blood lead levels in young children.	Environmental health perspectives	2008	8.44	Given the association between iron deficiency and lead absorption, we hypothesized that variants in iron metabolism genes would predict higher blood lead levels in young children. We examined the association between common missense variants in the hemochromatosis (HFE) and transferrin (TF) genes and blood lead levels in 422 Mexican children. Archived umbilical cord blood samples were genotyped for HFE (H63D and C282Y) and TF (P570S) variants. Blood lead was measured at 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 months of age. A total of 341 subjects had at least one follow-up blood lead level available and data available on covariates of interest for inclusion in the longitudinal analyses. We used random-effects models to examine the associations between genotype (HFE, TF, and combined HFE + TF) and repeated measures of blood lead, adjusting for maternal blood lead at delivery and child's concurrent anemia status. Of 422 children genotyped, 17.7, 3.3, and 18.9% carried the HFE H63D, HFE C282Y, and TF P570S variants, respectively. One percent of children carried both the HFE C282Y and TF P570S variants, and 3% of children carried both the HFE H63D and TF P570S variants. On average, carriers of either the HFE (beta = 0.11, p = 0.04) or TF (beta = 0.10, p = 0.08) variant had blood lead levels that were 11% and 10% higher, respectively, than wild-type subjects. In models examining the dose effect, subjects carrying both variants (beta = 0.41, p = 0.006) had blood lead 50% higher than wild-type subjects and a significantly higher odds of having a blood lead level > 10 microg/dL (odds ratio = 18.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-177.1). Iron metabolism gene variants modify lead metabolism such that HFE variants are associated with increased blood lead levels in young children. The joint presence of variant alleles in the HFE and TF genes showed the greatest effect, suggesting a gene-by-gene-by-environment interaction.	18795173
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Identification of new mutations of the HFE, hepcidin, and transferrin receptor 2 genes by denaturing HPLC analysis of individuals with biochemical indications of iron overload.	Clinical chemistry	2003	7.46	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a recessive disorder characterized by iron accumulation in parenchymal cells, followed by organ damage and failure. The disorder is mainly attributable to the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene, but additional mutations in the HFE, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), and hepcidin genes have been reported. The copresence of mutations in different genes may explain the phenotypic heterogeneity of the disorder and its variable penetrance. We used denaturing HPLC (DHPLC) for rapid DNA scanning of the HFE (exons 2, 3, and 4), hepcidin, and TfR2 (exons 2, 4 and 6) genes in a cohort of 657 individuals with altered indicators of iron status. DHPLC identification of C282Y and H63D HFE alleles was in perfect agreement with the restriction endonuclease assay. Fourteen DNA samples were heterozygous for the HFE S65C mutation. In addition, we found novel mutations: two in HFE (R66C in exon 2 and R224G in exon 4), one in the hepcidin gene (G71D), and one in TfR2 (V22I), plus several intronic or silent substitutions. Six of the seven individuals with hepcidin or TfR2 coding mutations carried also HFE C282Y or S65C mutations. DHPLC is an efficient method for mutational screening for the genes involved in hereditary hemochromatosis and for the study of their copresence.	14633868
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency in Georgia (USA): correlation of clinical and biochemical phenotype with genotype.	Human mutation	2003	5.09	Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that is the most frequent cause of clinical homocystinuria. Patients not treated in infancy have multi-systems disorders including dislocated lenses, mental deficiency, osteoporosis, premature arteriosclerosis, and thrombosis. In this paper, we examine the relationship of the clinical and biochemical phenotypes with the genotypes of 12 CBS deficient patients from 11 families from the state of Georgia, USA. By DNA sequencing of all of the coding exons we identified mutations in the CBS genes in 21 of the 22 possible mutant alleles. Ten different missense mutations were identified and one novel splice-site mutation was found. Five of the missense mutations were previously described (G307S, I278T, V320A, T353M, and L101P), while five were novel (A226T, N228S, A231L, D376N, Q526K). Each missense mutation was tested for function by expression in S. cerevisiae and all were found to cause decreased growth rate and to have significantly decreased levels of CBS enzyme activity. The I278T and T353M mutations accounted for 45% of the mutant alleles in this patient cohort. The T353M mutation, found exclusively in four African American patients, was associated with a B(6)-nonresponsive phenotype and detection by newborn screening for hypermethioninemia. The I278T mutation was found exclusively in Caucasian patients and was associated with a B(6)-responsive phenotype. We conclude that these two mutations occurred after ethnic socialization and that the CBS genotype is predictive of phenotype.	14635102

American journal of hematology	2003	5.0	Three polymorphic gene mutations in the human hemochromatosis (HFE) gene (C282Y, H63D, S65C) are associated with non-transfusion-related iron overload in Caucasians. More recently, these mutations have also been identified in African-Americans. However, the prevalence of HFE gene mutations in African-Americans with sickle cell disease (SCD) has not been described. The presence of these mutations in this population is particularly important, because patients with SCD may be placed on chronic red cell transfusion therapy and are thus at further risk for iron overload. Thus, we attempted to establish the gene mutation prevalence in African-Americans with SCD, to compare this frequency with published gene frequencies in African-Americans, and to evaluate their significance with regard to transfusion-related iron overload. Eighty-nine African-American patients with SCD, all of whom were receiving chronic red cell transfusion therapy, were screened by DNA analysis for the three HFE gene mutations. Two patients were heterozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation (2.3%), six were heterozygous for the H63D mutation (6.8%), none carried the S65C mutation (0.0%), and no homozygous or compound heterozygous subjects were identified. The prevalence of C282Y and H63D in the SCD population was similar to that observed in the general African-American population. In addition, there was no increased mutation prevalence when comparing those SCD patients on chronic transfusion therapy who had ferritin levels greater than 2,500 ng/mL and those less than 2,500 ng/mL. This study represents the first identification of the known HFE gene mutations by DNA analysis in the SCD population. We conclude that the presence of recognized HFE coding region mutations do not seem to have an impact on the degree of iron overload in patients with SCD receiving chronic transfusion therapy.	14635204
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of African Americans with primary iron overload.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Primary iron overload may be relatively common in African Americans, but its cause is incompletely understood. Thus, we evaluated genotype and phenotype characteristics of unselected African American index patients with primary iron overload who reside in central Alabama. All had hepatic iron concentration > or =30 micromol/g dry wt or > or =2.0 g of iron mobilized by phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion. Genotype analyses were performed in African American control subjects from the same region. There were 23 patients (19 men, 4 women); mean age at diagnosis was 52 +/- 12 years (1 SD) (range 32-69 years). Nine (39.1%) reported that they consumed > or =45 g of ethanol daily; five had chronic hepatitis C. Eight had some form of hemoglobinopathy or thalassemia. Mean serum transferrin saturation was 56 +/- 28% (range 15-100%). The geometric mean serum ferritin at diagnosis was 1076 ng/mL [95% confidence interval 297-3473 ng/mL]. Increased stainable liver iron was observed in hepatocytes only in 4 patients, in macrophages only in 8 patients, and in hepatocytes and macrophages in 8 patients. The mean quantity of iron mobilized by phlebotomy (corrected for iron absorbed during treatment) was 5.3 +/- 2.0 g (range 4.0-8.4 g). Iron removed by phlebotomy was greater in patients with hemoglobinopathy or thalassemia than in those without these forms of anemia (6.6 +/- 1.3 g vs 3.9 +/- 1.6 g, respectively; P = 0.0144). Daily consumption of > or =45 g of ethanol or chronic hepatitis C was not associated with an increased or decreased amount of phlebotomy-mobilized iron, on the average. The percentage of index patients positive for HFE C282Y was greater than that of controls (P = 0.0058). The respective percentages of phenotype positivity for HFE H63D, D6S105(8), and HLA-A*03 were similar in patients and controls. HFE S65C, I105T, and G93R were not detected in index or control subjects. Two of 13 patients were heterozygous for the ferroportin allele nt 744 G-->T (Q248H), although the phenotype frequency of this allele was similar in patients and 39 controls. Synonymous ferroportin alleles were also detected in some patients. The ceruloplasmin mutation nt 1099C-->T (exon 6; Arg367Cys) was detected in 1 of 2 patients tested. Abnormal alleles of beta-2 microglobulin, Nramp2, TFR2, hepcidin, or IRP2 alleles were not detected in either of the 2 patients so tested. We conclude that primary iron overload in African Americans is not the result of the mutation of a single gene. HFE C282Y, ferroportin 744 G-->T, and common forms of heritable anemia appear to account for increased iron absorption or retention in some patients.	14636644
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis-associated HFE genotypes in English blood donors: age-related frequency and biochemical expression.	Journal of hepatology	2003	10.59	There are limited data on the frequency and biochemical expression of the haemochromatosis-associated mutations C282Y and H63D in healthy people. We genotyped (bi-directional PCR amplification of specific alleles method) and performed serum iron studies in randomly selected English male blood donors (<4 previous units donated) in four age bands <30, 30-40, 40-50 and >50 years. In 6261 subjects, frequency of C282Y homozygosity (+/+) was 0.3%, C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity (+/-) 2.0%, and H63D and C282Y heterozygosity +/-, 21.7 and 10.4%, respectively. Genotype distribution was within Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in each age band. C282Y +/- frequency fell from 11.7% in subjects <30 years to 8.2% in subjects >50 (Chi2 7.19; P<0.005). No such trend was seen for C282Y +/+. In C282Y +/+ subjects, median serum ferritin was 247 (range 60-2449) microg/l and exceeded >500 microg/l in only two of 18 subjects. Compared to wild/wild (-/-) subjects, C282Y and H63D +/- subjects had slightly higher serum iron and lower unsaturated iron binding concentrations, similar overall serum ferritin values but higher serum ferritin values in subjects who had previously donated blood. C282Y +/+ shows limited biochemical expression and no trend towards age-related attrition. C282Y and H63D +/- may protect against iron deficiency.	14642607
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotype and parameters of iron metabolism in German first-time blood donors - evidence for an increased transferrin saturation in C282Y heterozygotes.	Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie	2003	1.36	Hemochromatosis is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive mode and associated with missense mutations in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE), an HLA class 1 related gene. However the degree of penetrance is presently matter of debate. To elucidate the frequency of HFE mutations in a German population and the relationship between genotype and phenotype, we determined the HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes in 500 first-time blood donors using an allele-specific ligase chain reaction (LCR). Ferritin and transferrin saturation (TS) of all donors found to have at least one mutation were compared to gender- and age-matched controls. The C282Y allele frequency was 46 in 1000 chromosomes (4.6 %). The allele frequency of H63D was 108 in 1000 (10.8 %) chromosomes. We found three persons homozygous for H63D, nine compound heterozygotes and none homozygous for C282Y. TS was elevated in C282Y heterozygotes (p = 0.002) and C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes (p = 0.04) compared to wild-type controls. Serum ferritin tended to be elevated in compound heterozygotes (p = 0.053). Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and hemoglobin (MCH) were not different from controls. The frequency of HFE mutations in the tested population was comparable to those of other northern European populations. The elevated TS in subjects carrying a single copy of the C282Y mutation suggests that C282Y heterozygosity is associated with an increased intestinal iron absorption and might therefore offer a selection advantage in conditions of iron depletion.	14648375
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Was the C282Y mutation an Irish Gaelic mutation that the Vikings helped disseminate? HLA haplotype observations of hemochromatosis from the west coast of Sweden.	European journal of haematology	2011	2.54	The HLA-related hemochromatosis mutation C282Y is thought to have originated in Ireland in a person with HLA-A3-B14 and was spread by Vikings. Irish people with two HLA-A3 alleles had a high risk of hemochromatosis. In this study, from west Sweden, we wanted to test these hypotheses. HFE mutations in controls, bone marrow donors with HLA-A3/A3 and patients with hemochromatosis. HLA haplotypes, extended haplotype analysis and pedigree studies. The allelic C282Y frequency 0.04, (CI 0.01-0.07) was lower (P < 0.001) in Sweden than in Ireland 0.10 (CI 0.08-0.11), and Swedish bone marrow donors with HLA-A3/A3 (n = 77) had a low risk of hemochromatosis. HLA haplotypes available from 239/262 (91.5%) proband patients homozygous for C282Y showed a dominance of A3-B7 and A3-B14 both in linkage disequilibrium with controls (P < 0.001). Pedigree studies extended into the 17th century supported a local founder effect of A3-B14 in the county of Bohuslän. The A3-B14 haplotype may well be the original and A3-B7 the result of centromeric recombinations. The haplotype diversity and recombination events were not different from a Celtic series. These findings do not support the hypothesis of the C282Y mutation being of an Irish Celtic origin. The C282Y frequency shows a west to east decline from Ireland through the north of Europe. Vikings may have been involved in the spread of C282Y, but the mutation is probably older and may have been spread in Europe by earlier seafarers.	20946107
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Low prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis in multiethnic populations in Northern Norway.	Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology	2011	2.2	Hereditary hemochromatosis has an autosomal recessive inheritance. The C282Y homozygosity is the most common genetic mutation in persons of Northern European descent. A screen of two multiethnic populations in Northern Norway was performed to investigate whether the prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis was consistent with previous results in Northern Europe. Participants in two population-based studies in Northern Norway were analyzed for serum ferritin (s-ferritin) and transferrin saturation. Participants with s-ferritin or transferrin saturation above the reference limits in two separate blood samples were tested for three different HFE mutations, namely C282Y, H63D and S65. The estimated prevalence of the C282Y/C282Y mutation in the two municipalities studied was lower than in comparable studies in Norway. The prevalence was the lowest in the Sør-Varanger population (men 0.19% and women 0.22%), which also had the highest proportion of individuals with Sami and Kven affiliation. In Tromsø, the prevalence was consistent with previous results in Norway. The prevalence of hereditary hemochromatosis is lower in multiethnic populations in Northern Norway than in previous studies from other parts of Norway.	20950210
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by a clinically definable arthropathy that correlates with iron load.	Arthritis and rheumatism	2011	8.96	To determine the frequency and character of arthropathy in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and to investigate the relationship between this arthropathy, nodal interphalangeal osteoarthritis, and iron load. Participants were recruited from the community by newspaper advertisement and assigned to diagnostic confidence categories for HH (definite/probable or possible/unlikely). Arthropathy was determined by use of a predetermined clinical protocol, radiographs of the hands of all participants, and radiographs of other joints in which clinical criteria were met. An arthropathy considered typical for HH, involving metacarpophalangeal joints 2-5 and bilateral specified large joints, was observed in 10 of 41 patients with definite or probable HH (24%), all of whom were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, while only 2 of 62 patients with possible/unlikely HH had such an arthropathy (P=0.0024). Arthropathy in definite/probable HH was more common with increasing age and was associated with ferritin concentrations>1,000 μg/liter at the time of diagnosis (odds ratio 14.0 [95% confidence interval 1.30-150.89], P=0.03). A trend toward more episodes requiring phlebotomy was also observed among those with arthropathy, but this was not statistically significant (odds ratio 1.03 [95% confidence interval 0.99-1.06], P=0.097). There was no significant association between arthropathy in definite/probable HH and a history of intensive physical labor (P=0.12). An arthropathy consistent with that commonly attributed to HH was found to occur in 24% of patients with definite/probable HH. The association observed between this arthropathy, homozygosity for C282Y, and serum ferritin concentrations at the time of diagnosis suggests that iron load is likely to be a major determinant of arthropathy in HH and to be more important than occupational factors.	20954257
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Altered hepatic BMP signaling pathway in human HFE hemochromatosis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2010	0.5	Human hemochromatosis (HC) has been associated with the common C282Y polymorphism of HFE or rare pathogenic mutations of TfR2, HJV, FPN and HAMP. All forms of human HC seem to be caused by low or inadequate levels of hepcidin, the iron hormone. We and others have recently shown that Hfe(-/-) mice exhibit an impairment in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway controlling hepcidin. However, all data indicating the central role of BMPs in hepcidin regulation and an impaired BMP/SMAD signaling in HC have been collected in mice. In this study we investigated whether also in humans the expression of BMP signaling targets, SMAD7 and Id1, are associated with liver iron concentration (LIC) and whether such regulation is disrupted in HFE-HC. We correlated the mRNA expression, assessed by RT-PCR, of HAMP, SMAD7 and Id1 with LIC in liver biopsies from patients with normal iron status, HFE-HC or non-HC hepatic iron overload. We found that in human liver, not only HAMP, but also SMAD7 and Id1 mRNA significantly correlate with the extent of hepatic iron burden. However, this correlation is lost in patients with HFE-HC, but maintained in subjects with non-hemochromatotic iron overload. These data indicate that in human HFE-HC a disrupted BMP/SMAD signaling in the liver is key in the pathogenesis of the disease.	20863724
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations in HAMP and HJV genes and their impact on expression of clinical hemochromatosis in a cohort of 100 Spanish patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation of HFE gene.	Annals of hematology	2009	3.02	Most hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. Nevertheless, penetrance of the disease is very variable. In some patients, penetrance can be mediated by concomitant mutations in other iron master genes. We evaluated the clinical impact of hepcidin (HAMP) and hemojuvelin mutations in a cohort of 100 Spanish patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. HAMP and hemojuvelin mutations were evaluated in all patients by bidirectional direct cycle sequencing. Phenotype-genotype interactions were evaluated. A heterozygous mutation of the HAMP gene (G71D) was found in only one out of 100 cases. Following, we performed a study of several members of that family, and we observed several members had a digenic inheritance of the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene and the G71D mutation of the HAMP gene. This mutation in the HAMP gene did not modify the phenotype of the individuals who were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. One other patient presented a new polymorphism in the hemojuvelin gene, without consequences in iron load or clinical course of the disease. In conclusion, HAMP and hemojuvelin mutations are rare among Spanish HH patients, and their impact in this population is not significant.	19214511
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Porphyria cutanea tarda. An analysis of HFE gene mutations, hepatitis viruses, alcohol intake, and other risk factors in 54 patients from Guipúzcoa, Basque Country, Spain].	Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva	2008	1.46	To study the frequency of HFE gene mutations (C282Y, H63D, S65C) in a group of 54 sporadic PCT patients and in a group of healthy controls (blood donors) from Guipúzcoa, Spain. We studied the association of PCT with HCV, HBV, alcohol abuse, and other established risk factors. The analysis of mutations was made by PCR. Allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared. Probability was determined and a Chi-squared test was performed. No association was observed between C282Y mutation and PCT (5.76 vs. 5% in controls). A high H63D mutation frequency was observed in PCT (34.25%) but was not statistically significant (controls 29.31%) because of the high prevalence of this mutation in the Basque general population. The S65C mutation was lower in PCT than in controls. There is a similar presence for H63D heterozygosis in PCT (38.8 vs. 38.8%). HCV association was observed in 35.18% of patients with PCT. HBV infected 7.4% of patients. Heavy alcohol intake (> 60 g/day) was present in 55.55% of patients. No HIV-infected patients were detected. The study of other risk factors revealed only one of the five women with PCT taking estrogens. Our results found no relevant role for C282Y and H63D mutations. External factors such as HCV and alcohol could be determinant in the development of PCT in the Basque population.	19222337
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Influence of HFE variants and cellular iron on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.	Journal of neuroinflammation	2009	4.67	Polymorphisms in the MHC class 1-like gene known as HFE have been proposed as genetic modifiers of neurodegenerative diseases that include neuroinflammation as part of the disease process. Variants of HFE are relatively common in the general population and are most commonly associated with iron overload, but can promote subclinical cellular iron loading even in the absence of clinically identified disease. The effects of the variants as well as the resulting cellular iron dyshomeostasis potentially impact a number of disease-associated pathways. We tested the hypothesis that the two most common HFE variants, H63D and C282Y, would affect cellular secretion of cytokines and trophic factors. We screened a panel of cytokines and trophic factors using a multiplexed immunoassay in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing different variants of HFE. The influence of cellular iron secretion on the potent chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) was assessed using ferric ammonium citrate and the iron chelator, desferroxamine. Additionally, an antioxidant, Trolox, and an anti-inflammatory, minocycline, were tested for their effects on MCP-1 secretion in the presence of HFE variants. Expression of the HFE variants altered the labile iron pool in SH-SY5Y cells. Of the panel of cytokines and trophic factors analyzed, only the release of MCP-1 was affected by the HFE variants. We further examined the relationship between iron and MCP-1 and found MCP-1 secretion tightly associated with intracellular iron status. A potential direct effect of HFE is considered because, despite having similar levels of intracellular iron, the association between HFE genotype and MCP-1 expression was different for the H63D and C282Y HFE variants. Moreover, HFE genotype was a factor in the effect of minocycline, a multifaceted antibiotic used in treating a number of neurologic conditions associated with inflammation, on MCP-1 secretion. Our results demonstrate that HFE polymorphisms influence the synthesis and release of MCP-1. The mechanism of action involves cellular iron status but it appears there could be additional influences such as ER stress. Finally, these data demonstrate a pharmacogenetic effect of HFE polymorphisms on the ability of minocycline to inhibit MCP-1 secretion.	19228389
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Acquired and genetic factors influencing the penetrance of HFE haemochromatosis].	Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine	2008	0.5	C282Y homozygosity is necessary (but insufficient in isolation) for the onset of hemochromatosis, as indicated by its low biochemical penetrance (75 % in men and 50 % in women) and clinical penetrance (25 % in men and 0 % in women). Factors modulating iron load may be acquired (diet, alcohol, metabolic syndrome, drugs, etc.) or, more importantly, genetic (digenism, polymorphism of genes involved in the regulation of hepcidin synthesis). Factors modulating iron-related organ damage include alcohol consumption, the metabolic syndrome, and the TGF-beta1 (hepatic fibrosis) and superoxide dismutase genes (cardiomyopathy). Further studies of these modifiers are needed to improve the management of C282Y homozygotes, at both the individual and the population levels.	19238778
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Dilution of candidates: the case of iron-related genes in restless legs syndrome.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2013	4.58	Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common multifactorial disease. Some genetic risk factors have been identified. RLS susceptibility also has been related to iron. We therefore asked whether known iron-related genes are candidates for association with RLS and, vice versa, whether known RLS-associated loci influence iron parameters in serum. RLS/control samples (n = 954/1814 in the discovery step, 735/736 in replication 1, and 736/735 in replication 2) were tested for association with SNPs located within 4 Mb intervals surrounding each gene from a list of 111 iron-related genes using a discovery threshold of P = 5 × 10(-4). Two population cohorts (KORA F3 and F4 with together n = 3447) were tested for association of six known RLS loci with iron, ferritin, transferrin, transferrin-saturation, and soluble transferrin receptor. Results were negative. None of the candidate SNPs at the iron-related gene loci was confirmed significantly. An intronic SNP, rs2576036, of KATNAL2 at 18q21.1 was significant in the first (P = 0.00085) but not in the second replication step (joint nominal P-value = 0.044). Especially, rs1800652 (C282Y) in the HFE gene did not associate with RLS. Moreover, SNPs at the known RLS loci did not significantly affect serum iron parameters in the KORA cohorts. In conclusion, the correlation between RLS and iron parameters in serum may be weaker than assumed. Moreover, in a general power analysis, we show that genetic effects are diluted if they are transmitted via an intermediate trait to an end-phenotype. Sample size formulas are provided for small effect sizes.	22929029
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Population-based study of the relationship between mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene and arthritis.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2006	3.32	Mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene are carried by one in three individuals of British Isles descent and may result in increased iron stores. These increased iron stores could potentially induce or exacerbate diseases, such as arthritis, in which iron has a role in pathogenesis. Although arthritis is a well-known association of clinically overt hereditary hemochromatosis, controversy surrounds the role of mutations in the HFE gene as risk factors for arthritis. The aim of the present study was to determine whether mutations in the HFE gene are associated with an increased prevalence of arthritis. A population-based study was conducted in Busselton, Western Australia, of the prevalence of arthritis in 1372 individuals of British Isles descent. Participants completed a questionnaire and general physical examination. Analysis for C282Y and H63D HFE mutations was undertaken. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated for the relationship between HFE mutations and the prevalence of self-reported, doctor-diagnosed arthritis. There was no association between the presence of HFE mutations and the prevalence of self-reported, doctor-diagnosed arthritis (C282Y/wild type (WT) adjusted OR = 1.041 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-1.61), H63D/WT OR = 0.76 (95% CI 0.53-1.08), C282Y/C282Y OR = 0.39 (95% CI 0.04-3.63), C282Y/H 63D OR = 0.808 (95% CI 0.27-2.42), H63D/H63D OR = 0.419 (95% CI 0.13-1.36)). Overall adjusted OR for arthritis in participants with one or more HFE mutations was 0.81 (95% CI 0.61-1.09). Mutations of the HFE gene are not risk factors for arthritis in populations of British Isles descent.	16638105
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Targeted screening for genetic haemochromatosis: a combined phenotype/genotype approach.	Journal of clinical pathology	2006	2.91	To evaluate the clinical utility of a targeted screening approach for the detection of genetic haemochromatosis. Screening by measuring fasting serum transferrin saturation (TS) and gene testing was carried out in patients in whom a raised serum alanine amino transferase (ALT) activity and raised random serum TS had been found on routine blood testing. During the 29 month study period, 32 patients homozygous for the C282Y genotype were detected from a catchment population of 330,000 by screening blood samples referred initially for routine laboratory liver function tests. By comparison, during the same period of time and within the same population, only seven patients were found by clinical suspicion alone. The patients in the study, after treatment by venesection, have shown both clinical and biochemical improvement. The study shows that from a population of patients in whom a routine liver function profile had been requested, it is possible to detect subjects homozygous for the C282Y HFE genotype who have clinical or biochemical markers of iron overload.	16644885

Genetika	2006	0.5	Analysis of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene was carried out in 594 individuals representing seven indigenous populations of Central Asia. Among the populations examined, mutation C28Y was found in Uighurs with the frequency of 0.009, and in Kazakhs and Tajiks with the frequency of 0.012. The mutation was absent in Uzbeks, Kyrgyzes, Kurds, and Turkmens. Mutation H63D was detected in all populations studied with the frequencies ranging from 0.024 (Tajiks) to 0.139 (Turkmens). Judging by the frequencies of the mutations of interest, the populations examined occupied the intermediate position between the European and Eastern Asian populations, which corresponded to their geographical position.	16649670
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Homocysteine concentration in coronary artery disease: Influence of three common single nucleotide polymorphisms.	Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD	2016	3.39	Whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of homocysteine metabolism enzymes influence the rate of cardiovascular (CV) events in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients remains controversial. In this analysis, 1126 subjects from the AtheroGene study with CAD and 332 control subjects without known CAD were included. The following SNPs were investigated: methylentetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR-C667T), methionin synthetase (MS-D919G), and cystathionin beta synthetase (CBS-I278T). The endpoint was the combination of cardiovascular death, stroke, and non-fatal myocardial infarction (N = 286). The median follow-up time was 6.4 years. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed an increasing event rate with rising homocysteine levels (p < 0.001) in CAD patients. Further, in Cox-Regression analysis homocysteine was a predictor of the endpoint with a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.5 (95% CI: 2.9-14.6, p < 0.001) in the adjusted model including cardiovascular risk factors. Of the three SNPs, homozygous MTHFR SNP increased homocysteine levels significantly in patients with CAD and individuals without CAD (both p < 0.001). The SNPs in MS and CBS were not related to relevant changes in homocysteine levels in CAD patients or controls. The different SNPs of MTHFR, MS, and CBS were not related to an increased event rate. Homocysteine level is a strong predictor of CV events. Subjects with and without CAD and SNPs in the enzyme MTHFR had increased homocysteine levels. This was not observed for MS and CBS SNPs. Although MTHFR SNPs alter homocysteine levels in patients and controls, these polymorphisms had no impact on prognosis in CAD patients.	27773468

Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi	2000	0.5	To detect two novel mutations (C282Y and H63D) of the HFE gene in Chinese patients with hepatic iron overload. Multicentre retrospective study. Four public hospitals, Hong Kong. Fifty Chinese patients who presented from January 1987 through December 1999 with hepatic iron overload from various causes. The DNA from liver biopsy samples was tested for HFE mutations by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The sample DNA quality was unsatisfactory for analysis of the C282Y mutation in one case and the H63D mutation in nine cases. The C282Y mutation was not detected in any of the 49 satisfactory samples. Three of the 41 samples were heterozygous for the H63D mutation and only one was homozygous, giving an allele frequency of 6.1%. Of the three H63D-heterozygotes, one had beta-thalassaemia major, one had beta-thalassaemia minor, and one had hereditary spherocytosis. None of the 12 patients who were presumed to have primary haemochromatosis were positive for either mutation. The classical form of human leukocyte antigen-linked hereditary haemochromatosis appears to be absent form this locality. The H63D mutation is found in a minority (9.8%) of the patients, in whom it may act synergistically with an erythropoietic factor.	10895137

Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	2015	0.5	Objectives The recent availability of potent oral iron chelators is renewing an interest in the assessment of the possible impact of HFE genetics in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Methods Thirty-six newly diagnosed patients with MDS were studied for parameters of iron metabolism in addition to C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. Results Mutations were present in 11 out of 36 patients (31%), which was not different from our general population and were equally distributed among MDS subtypes. Mutated patients had higher ferritin levels (P = 0.039) and lower TIBC (P = 0.018). Ferritin was found to be higher for the untransfused mutated patients (P = 0.017), but not for transfusion-dependent patients in whom ferritin levels correlated significantly with the number of blood units received (P = 0.04). There was no difference in the number of blood units received between the mutated and wild type patients. A new observation made was that the mutated patients had a lower overall survival in addition to a poorer leukemia free survival (P = 0.004 and P = 0.003, respectively). Discussion The HFE gene mutations are not more frequent in MDS patients. Iron overload in mutated patients was higher but there was no correlation found using supportive therapy for anemia. The effect of mutations on survival could be mediated by changes in iron metabolism. Conclusion The HFE genotype may predict MDS prognosis and there is a need for further studies. It remains a challenging question if HFE mutated MDS patients should be considered for potent iron chelation therapy.	25938278
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Reference centiles for serum ferritin and percentage of transferrin saturation, with application to mutations of the HFE gene.	Clinical chemistry	2001	7.46	The gene that causes most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis is designated HFE. Individuals with mutations in the HFE gene may have increased serum iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin concentrations relative to individuals with the wild-type genotype. We generated reference centiles for percentage of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentrations in normal (wild-type), healthy Caucasian adults. We then examined transferrin and ferritin concentrations relative to these centiles in 81 individuals homozygous for the major hemochromatosis mutation C282Y and 438 individuals with the compound heterozygous HFE genotype C282Y/H63D. Serum ferritin concentrations, but not percentage of transferrin saturation, in normal, healthy women tended to increase sharply as they progressed through menopause. Transferrin and serum ferritin centiles for normal, healthy females were lower than the corresponding centiles in normal, healthy males. C282Y homozygotes had abnormally high transferrin saturation and serum ferritin values relative to the wild types. Compound heterozygotes appeared to be a mixture of individuals with unexceptional transferrin and ferritin values and those with abnormally large values similar to the homozygotes, with equal proportions of each. There are age- and sex-related differences in reference centiles for the percentage of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentrations in normal, healthy adults. Individuals homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene have abnormal transferrin saturation and serum ferritin values relative to the reference population; penetrance with the compound heterozygotes, as reflected by abnormal transferrin and ferritin values, is less than with the homozygotes.	11568090
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	[APOC3, CETP, beta-fibrinogen and MTHFR are genetic determinants of carotid intim-media thickness (Stanislas cohort)].	Archives des maladies du coeur et des vaisseaux	2001	0.5	The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) interindividual variability and 16 polymorphisms of 11 genes associated with cardiovascular risk factors (genes among lipid and homocysteine metabolisms, blood viscosity, platelet aggregation, leukocyte adhesion and renin-angiotensin system). CIMT was measured by high resolution B mode ultrasonography in an healthy population of 77 men and 84 women, aged 35-54 years and selected from a French cohort: the Stanislas cohort. The polymorphisms studied were genotyped by a multilocus approach. Statistical analysis were done by ANOVA after adjustment of CIMT for age, BMI and smoking and by multiple regression analyses. No association was found with APOB Thr71 Ile, APOC3 -482C/T, -455T/C, GpIIIa P1A, AT1R 1166A/C, AGT Met235Thr, CBS Ile278Thr, SELE 98G/T and SELE Ser128Arg, polymorphism neither in men nor in women. Although, in women we found always no association for the APOC3 3206T/G, 3175C/G, 1100C/T, the CETP Ile405Val, the MTHFR 677C/T and the fibrinogen -455G/A polymorphism's, in men these polymorphism's were associated with CIMT variability (0.01 < or = p < or = 0.05). The most interesting finding was that altogether these genes in men were able to explain a considerable part, 20.6%, of CIMT variability. Therefore, our study gives a new opportunity to understand CIMT variability.	11575217
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene have no effect on iron overload disorders in Japan.	Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)	2001	0.5	The gene responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis close to the human leukocyte antigen A locus was previously identified and designated as HFE. This study was performed to evaluate the clinical significance of two mutations, C282Y and H63D of HFE, in Japanese patients with hepatic iron overload. We examined C282Y and H63D in 11 patients with primary hemochromatosis, 94 patients with chronic hepatitis C, 54 patients with miscellaneous liver diseases, and 151 healthy volunteers. The HFE gene region of DNA samples extracted from peripheral leukocytes was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Restriction enzyme analysis was performed using SnaBI for C282Y and BclI for H63D. Direct sequence analysis was then performed when products suggested the presence of a mutation. All the subjects studied were free from C282Y. None of the patients with hemochromatosis had H63D. One patient with chronic hepatitis C was homozygous, and 4 patients were heterozygous for H63D. Two patients with alcoholic liver disease were heterozygous for H63D. The prevalence of chromosomes with H63D was 6/188 (3.2%) in patients with chronic hepatitis C, 2/108 (1.9%) in patients with miscellaneous liver diseases, and 8/302 (2.6%) in healthy volunteers. These differences were not significant. Our results suggested that neither C282Y nor H63D in HFE affect Japanese patients with hemochromatosis or chronic hepatitis C.	11579943
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for hemochromatosis: high prevalence and low morbidity in an unselected population of 65,238 persons.	Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology	2001	2.2	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common genetic disease leading to accumulation of iron in several organs, most notably the liver. The C282Y/C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is found in most cases. In order to prevent clinical disease and to study the cost and feasibility of screening, a large population was screened. In a Norwegian county, all inhabitants 20 years or older were invited to participate in a population-based health survey programme. Screening for HH was one of several subprojects. Blood samples were obtained from 65,238 persons. Subjects with high serum transferrin saturation in two tests and high serum ferritin were clinically evaluated for HH. All subjects with high serum transferrin saturation in two tests were offered genotyping. HH was newly diagnosed in 92 women and 177 men. Phlebotomy treatment was performed in 64 women and 152 men. Severe organ damage (liver cirrhosis) was ascertained in only 4 men. We found no correlation between serum ferritin and age. The estimated cost was US$ 1.6 per subject screened and US$ 390 per newly discovered HH subject. The estimated prevalence of phenotypical HH not previously known was 0.34% in women and 0.68% in men. The prevalence of the C282Y/C282Y mutation was at least 0.68%. Large-scale screening for HH can be performed at a relatively low cost if combined with a health survey programme. The yield in terms of newly discovered cases is considerable, but few cases were found seriously ill. Better knowledge of the natural course of HH is necessary if we are to be able to estimate the cost-effectiveness of large-scale screening.	11589387
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Venesection therapy of insulin resistance-associated hepatic iron overload.	Journal of hepatology	2001	10.59	The association of hepatic iron overload with metabolic disorders has been coined as the insulin resistance-associated hepatic iron overload syndrome (IR-HIO). Fifty-six IR-HIO patients were phlebotomized either weekly (n = 14) or bimonthly (n = 42) and compared with C282Y homozygotes and with ten IR-HIO patients treated by a low calorie diet alone. In venesected patients, the median amount of mobilized iron was 0.6 g in 2.8 months in females and 1.8 g in 5 months in males. Mobilized iron did not differ depending on the frequency of venesections or HFE genotype. When compared with C282Y homozygotes, IR-HIO patients had a similar amount of mobilized iron, but three-fold serum ferritin levels. The presenting symptoms (chronic fatigue and/or polyarthralgias) improved in 6/7 patients. Phlebotomies were well tolerated. In patients treated by a low calorie diet, serum ferritin levels remained stable. In IR-HIO patients, body iron stores are significantly increased, overestimated by serum ferritin, not modified by a low calorie diet, and safely removed by phlebotomies. Based on these data and on studies indicating that iron excess is associated with increased risk for hepatic fibrosis, cancer and cardiovascular disorders, venesection therapy can be recommended in IR-HIO patients.	11592595
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Epistasis in iron metabolism: complex interactions between Cp, Mon1a, and Slc40a1 loci and tissue iron in mice.	Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society	2013	2.08	Disorders of iron metabolism are among the most common acquired and constitutive diseases. Hemochromatosis has a solid genetic basis and in Northern European populations it is usually associated with homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE protein. However, the penetrance of this mutation is incomplete and the clinical presentation is highly variable. The rare and common variants identified so far as genetic modifiers of HFE-related hemochromatosis are unable to account for the phenotypic heterogeneity of this disorder. There are wide variations in the basal iron status of common inbred mouse strains, and this diversity may reflect the genetic background of the phenotypic diversity under pathological conditions. We therefore examined the genetic basis of iron homeostasis using quantitative trait loci mapping applied to the HcB-15 recombinant congenic strains for tissue and serum iron indices. Two highly significant QTL containing either the N374S Mon1a mutation or the Ferroportin locus were found to be major determinants in spleen and liver iron loading. Interestingly, when considering possible epistatic interactions, the effects of Mon1a on macrophage iron export are conditioned by the genotype at the Slc40a1 locus. Only mice that are C57BL/10ScSnA homozygous at both loci display a lower spleen iron burden. Furthermore, the liver-iron lowering effect of the N374S Mon1a mutation is observed only in mice that display a nonsense mutation in the Ceruloplasmin (Cp) gene. This study highlights the existence of genetic interactions between Cp, Mon1a, and the Slc40a1 locus in iron metabolism, suggesting that epistasis may be a crucial determinant of the variable biological and clinical presentations in iron disorders.	24121729
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Total and cause-specific mortality by elevated transferrin saturation and hemochromatosis genotype in individuals with diabetes: two general population studies.	Diabetes care	2014	8.93	Mortality is increased in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, in individuals from the general population with increased transferrin saturation (TS), and also in patients with type 1 diabetes and increased TS from a highly specialized diabetes clinic. Thus, we have recommended targeted screening for TS in specialized diabetes clinics. Whether mortality is also increased in individuals from the general population with diabetes and increased TS is unknown. In two Danish population studies (N = 84,865), we examined mortality according to baseline levels of TS and hemochromatosis genotype (HFE) G → A substitution at nucleotide 845 in codon 282 (C282Y/C282Y) in individuals with diabetes (type 1, N = 118; type 2, N = 3,228; total, N = 3,346). The cumulative survival rate was reduced in individuals with diabetes with TS ≥50% vs. <50% (log-rank; P < 0.0001), with median survival ages of 66 and 79 years, respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) for TS ≥50% vs. <50% was 2.0 (95% CI 1.3-2.8; P = 0.0004) for total mortality overall (and similar for men and women separately); 2.6 (1.3-5.4; P = 0.008) for neoplasms; and 3.4 (2.0-6.0; P = 0.00002) for endocrinological causes. A stepwise increased risk of total mortality was observed for stepwise increasing TS (log-rank test, P = 0.0001), with an HR for TS ≥70% vs. TS <20% of 4.8 (2.0-12; P = 0.0006). The HR for total mortality in individuals with diabetes for C282Y/C282Y versus wild type/wild type was 3.3 (1.04-10; P = 0.04), and for C282Y/C282Y and TS ≥50% versus wild type/wild type and TS <50% was 6.0 (1.5-24; P = 0.01). Six percent of these premature deaths can possibly be avoided by early screening for TS or HFE genotype. Individuals with diabetes, ascertained in the general population, with increased TS or HFE genotype have a twofold to sixfold increased risk of premature death.	24130348
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Detection of the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms associated with hereditary hemochromatosis using the ABI 7500 fast real time PCR platform.	Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B	2007	1.47	Classic hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by iron overload and sequence variants in the HFE gene. The HFE gene is located at 6p21.3 and contains 2 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) C282Y and H63D, which are routinely tested for in the molecular diagnostics laboratory. In this study, we used DNA samples from 59 patients in which clinicians wanted to confirm or rule-out hereditary hemochromatosis that had been previously tested for the HFE SNPs using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay and the ABI 7700 real time PCR assay with a MGB Eclipse ASR Probe system. The new assay used TAQman SNP Genotyping Assays, which were performed on the ABI 7500 FAST real time PCR platform. Allelic discrimination was determined during a postamplification plate read. Of the 59 samples genotyped, 7 were homozygous for C282Y, 6 were heterozygous for C282Y, 9 were homozygous for H63D, 10 were heterozygous for H63D, 6 were compound heterozygotes, and 20 were wild type. With the exception of one sample that was indeterminate by the TAQman SNP Genotyping Assay, all others showed 100% concordance between the 3 assays. The one indeterminate sample was heterozygous for C282Y by the PCR-RFLP and ABI 7700 real time PCR assays, but there was an insufficient quantity of DNA to perform the TAQman SNP Genotyping Assay. Our study suggests that the ABI 7500 FAST TAQman SNP Genotyping Assay is comparable with the PCR-RFLP and ABI 7700 real time PCR methods in detecting and characterizing these 2 HFE SNPs. Improved software and thermocycling capabilities have resulted in a very robust TAQman assay with the advantage of a much improved turn-around-time and throughput.	17525682
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Chemical chaperone rescue of mutant human cystathionine beta-synthase.	Molecular genetics and metabolism	2007	3.09	Missense mutations in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, such as I278T, are responsible for CBS deficiency, the most common inherited disorder in sulfur metabolism. Expression of human mutant CBS proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that most disease causing mutations severely inhibit enzyme activity and cannot support growth of yeast on cysteine-free media. Here, we show that the osmolyte chemical chaperones glycerol, trimethylamine-N-oxide, dimethylsulfoxide, proline or sorbitol, when added to yeast media, allows growth on cysteine-free media and causes increased enzyme activity from I278T and three other mutant CBS proteins. Rescuable mutants are ones that are predicted to cause a decrease in solvent accessible surface area. The increase in enzyme activity is associated with stabilization of the tetramer form of the enzyme. This effect is not specific to yeast, as addition of the chaperone glycerol resulted in increased I278T activity when the enzyme is produced either in Escherichia coli or in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation reaction. However, no stimulation of specific activity was observed when chaperones were added directly to purified I278T indicating that the presence of chemical chaperones is required during translation. We also found that by mixing different chaperones we could achieve rescue at significantly lower chaperone concentrations. Taken together, our data show that chemical chaperones present during the initial folding process can facilitate proper folding of several mutant CBS proteins and suggest it may be possible to treat some inborn errors of metabolism with agents that enhance proper protein folding.	17540596
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Anejaculation caused by haemosiderosis: male infertility in hereditary haemochromatosis].	Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde	2007	0.5	A couple was investigated for subfertility. Haemochromatosis was suspected when the 36-year-old man had failure of ejaculation, fatigue and limited facial hair growth. Haemochromatosis was confirmed by an iron saturation of 102% (normal range: 20-45), a highly elevated serum ferritin concentration of 5468 mg/1l (normal range: 18-280) and highly elevated liver enzymes. Molecular genetics showed homozygous C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. Due to consequent venesection therapy, levels of ferritin and transferrin decreased and liver enzymes normalized. However luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone failed to increase to normal levels. Treatment with gonadotropins was then applied, which corrected ejaculation and semen characteristics. His partner failed to become pregnant with ovulation stimulation and intrauterine inseminations. After two unsuccessful IVF procedures she became pregnant in the third procedure. Haemochromatosis should be considered and iron studies performed if subfertility due to an endocrine disorder is being investigated. Deposition in the pituitary or the gonads of the HFE-mutated patients leads to hypogonadism. Most of the patients with C282Y mutation are homozygous (85-90%), but the majority of the carriers will not develop the disease. Deficiency of hepcidin, an important regulator for the iron metabolism, was suspected in our patient, based on the early onset of his disease and the low serum levels of hepcidin. The age at diagnosis and the start of venesections is critical for reversal of organ damage. Aggressive venesection can restore hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal function, preventing further organ damage. But with increasing disease progression venesection will not restore azoospermia or the failure to ejaculate.	17557664
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron biomarkers in plasma, HFE genotypes, and the risk for colorectal cancer in a prospective setting.	Diseases of the colon and rectum	2012	0.5	High iron levels can increase the formation of noxious oxygen radicals, which are thought to promote carcinogenesis. The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether iron biomarkers and HFE genotypes, which influence iron regulation, constitute risk factors for colorectal cancer. This is a prospective nested case-referent study. The study was performed within the population-based Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study. The study included 226 cases of colorectal cancer and 437 matched referents. Conditional regression analysis was performed. Adjustments for smoking, smoking and BMI, and HFE C282Y and H63D were performed. The highest quintile of total iron-binding capacity showed significantly higher risk for colorectal cancer, unadjusted OR 2.35 (95% CI 1.38-4.02). When stratified by sex, the findings were only present in women (OR 3.34 (95% CI 1.59-7.02)). Ferritin was associated with reduced risk throughout quintiles 2 to 5 both in univariate and multivariate models. Colorectal cancer may influence iron markers because of occult bleeding. Homozygotes for HFE C282Y were too few to make conclusions for this group. The relatively short follow-up time might be insufficient to detect risk of iron biomarkers. High iron levels do not increase the risk of colorectal cancer. HFE genotypes influencing iron uptake had no effect on colorectal cancer risk.	22469802
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutation carrier status and the risk of colon cancer.	Journal of the National Cancer Institute	2003	0.5	Iron is a pro-oxidant that may promote carcinogenesis. Mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene are associated with increased total body iron stores in some individuals. We assessed the risk of colon cancer among individuals with and without HFE gene mutations. We performed a population-based, case-control study in North Carolina. Case patients with colon cancer and control subjects provided information on multiple environmental exposures, including total iron intake and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. They also provided a venous blood sample, from which DNA was extracted, amplified, and subjected to diagnostic restriction enzyme mapping to detect two major HFE gene mutations, C282Y and H63D. Data were analyzed with Fisher's exact test and logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. Thirteen hundred and eight subjects participated (475 case patients, 833 control subjects). The allele frequencies of the H63D and C282Y mutations were greater among case patients (0.11 and 0.046, respectively) than among control subjects (0.09 and 0.044, respectively; P =.14 and P =.85, respectively). When we controlled for age, race, sex, red meat consumption, NSAID use, and total iron intake, subjects with any HFE gene mutation were more likely to have colon cancer than subjects with no HFE gene mutations (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07 to 1.87). The magnitude of the effect was similar for both the H63D (adjusted OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.04 to 1.98) and C282Y mutations (adjusted OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 0.88 to 2.19). The risk of colon cancer associated with an HFE gene mutation was similar for those who did and did not have a family history of colon cancer. Among those with HFE mutations, cancer risk increased with increasing age and total iron intake. HFE gene mutations are associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. Cancer risk is greatest in mutation carriers who are older or consume high quantities of iron.	12529348
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of hemochromatosis C282Y and H63D mutations in Sardinia.	Genetic testing	2002	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is one of the most common autosomal recessive disorders of iron metabolism among Caucasians, and it is associated with C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in populations of Celtic origins. A second mutation, H63D, shows a very high widespread frequency, although its role in iron metabolism is still inconclusive. There are no data on the frequencies of these two mutations in Sardinia, an island in the Mediterranean sea that has not been invaded by Celtic peoples. We examined 836 chromosomes from Sardinian subjects and tested for the mutation by restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products. Among the 836 analyzed chromosomes, we found a C282Y allele frequency of 0.0036 and an H63D allele frequency of 0.173. These data could explain the observed rarity of HH in Sardinia. The high allele frequency of H63D and the rarity of HH in Sardinia is suggestive that this mutation is not a major contributor to this disease.	12537659
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A very rare association of three mutations of the HFE gene for hemochromatosis.	Genetic testing	2002	0.5	In the present paper, we describe a patient who is a compound heterozygote for three mutations in the HFE gene: C282Y, H63D, and E168Q. The patient's mother carries two copies of H63D and one copy of E168Q; the patient's father is heterozygous for C282Y. The family study indicates that the patient, as well as his sister, a maternal uncle, and a first cousin, all have inherited a single HFE allele that contains two mutations H63D and E168Q. The clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of the patient and his relatives are consistent with the conclusion that the E168Q mutation by itself is unlikely to result in hemochromatosis.	12537660
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Uroporphyria caused by ethanol in Hfe(-/-) mice as a model for porphyria cutanea tarda.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2003	0.5	Two major risk factors for the development of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) are alcohol consumption and homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE). To develop an animal model, Hfe knockout mice were treated continuously with 10% ethanol in drinking water. By 4 months, uroporphyrin (URO) was detected in the urine. At 6 to 7 months, hepatic URO was increased and hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) activity was decreased. Untreated Hfe(-/-) mice or wild-type mice treated with or without ethanol did not show any of these biochemical changes. Treatment with ethanol increased hepatic nonheme iron and hepatic 5-aminolevulinate synthase activity in Hfe(-/-) but not wild-type mice. The increases in nonheme iron in Hfe(-/-) mice were associated with diffuse increases in iron staining of parenchymal cells but without evidence of significant liver injury. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the uroporphyrinogenic effect of ethanol is mediated by its effects on hepatic iron metabolism. Ethanol-treated Hfe(-/-) mice seem to be an excellent model for studies of alcohol-mediated PCT.	12540785
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A targeted approach significantly increases the identification rate of patients with undiagnosed haemochromatosis.	Journal of internal medicine	2003	7.8	To determine the optimal means of identifying patients with undiagnosed haemochromatosis. Case-control study where cases are defined by the presence of specific clinical diagnoses or symptoms. Primary care patients were recruited from three Oxfordshire practices and secondary care patients were recruited from those patients attending specialist clinics in Amiens University Hospital. A total of 569 patients recruited via hospital clinics and 60 primary care patients (recruited from 4022 consultations) presenting with the following haemochromatosis associated conditions, diabetes, arthralgia/chronic fatigue, osteoporosis or arthropathy were studied. The control group, a total of 991 healthy volunteers, were recruited through a Health Appraisal Centre. Patients and controls were included in the study if they or their family members had not previously been diagnosed with hereditary haemochromatosis. Serum ferritin concentration, transferrin saturation (Tsat) and presence of HFE mutations, C282Y and H63D. The check-up in controls consisted of a questionnaire, clinical examination, biochemical tests and screening for the presence of the C282Y and H63D mutations. Patient groups presenting with unstable diabetes or chronic fatigue and arthralgia together with a raised serum ferritin concentration showed an enrichment in the haemochromatosis-associated genotype HH/YY, odds ratio (OR) = 40.1, confidence interval (CI) = 8.0-202.1 and OR = 103, CI = 22.9-469.7, respectively. Patients presenting to hospital clinics with haemochromatosis associated conditions should be screened biochemically for iron overload. Only those with a serum ferritin >300 microg L-1 or Tsat >40% should subsequently go on to be genotyped for HFE mutations. The patients at greatest risk of having undiagnosed haemochromatosis are those presenting with unstable diabetes, or fatigue and/or arthralgia in the absence of any other explanation.	12542563
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Comprehensive hereditary hemochromatosis genotyping.	Tissue antigens	2002	2.05	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an iron-overload disease common in populations of Northern European origin. Patients display increased iron absorption leading to excessive iron deposition and potential multiorgan failure. Using polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP) technology, we have developed an HH diagnosis assay capable of detecting 19 non-synonymous HFE mutations (including a previously unreported mutation, V295A) and several TFR2, SLC11A3 and H ferritin alleles implicated in HH. As part of the validation process, 159 UK renal donors were genotyped to determine HH allele frequencies in the UK population. The alleles nominally identified as HFE*01 (C282Y), HFE*02 (H63D) and HFE*03 (S65C) were found at frequencies of 0.085, 0.173 and 0.009, respectively. All other potential HH-associated alleles were absent, confirming their low prevalence in this population. This assay enables comprehensive routine HH genotyping, producing rapid, accurate and reproducible results at low cost.	12542741
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased duodenal DMT-1 expression and unchanged HFE mRNA levels in HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis and iron deficiency.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	"""HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by imbalances of iron homeostasis and alterations in intestinal iron absorption. The identification of the HFE gene and the apical iron transporter divalent metal transporter-1, DMT-1, provide a direct method to address the mechanisms of iron overload in this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the regulation of duodenal HFE and DMT-1 gene expression in HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis. Small bowel biopsies and serum iron indices were obtained from a total of 33 patients. The study population comprised 13 patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (C282Y homozygous), 10 patients with iron deficiency anemia, and 10 apparently healthy controls, all of whom were genotyped for the two common mutations in the HFE gene (C282Y and H63D). Total RNA was isolated from tissue and amplified via RT-PCR for HFE, DMT-1, and the internal control GAPDH. DMT-1 protein expression was additionally assessed by immunohistochemistry. Levels of HFE mRNA did not differ significantly between patient groups (P = 0.09), specifically between C282Y homozygotes and iron deficiency anemic patients, when compared to controls (P = 0.09, P = 0.9, respectively). In contrast, DMT-1 mRNA levels were at least twofold greater in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and iron deficiency anemia when compared to controls (P = 0.02, P = 0.01, respectively). Heightened DMT-1 protein expression correlated with mRNA levels in all patients. Loss of HFE function in hereditary hemochromatosis is not derived from inhibition of its gene expression. DMT-1 expression in C282Y homozygote subjects is consistent with the hypothesis of a """"paradoxical"""" duodenal iron deficiency in hereditary hemochromatosis. The observed twofold upregulation of the DMT-1 is consistent with the slow but steady increase in body iron stores observed in those presenting with clinical features of hereditary hemochromatosis."""	12547214
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of the HFE gene mutations in five Italian populations.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Genetic hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by iron overload and a variety of clinical manifestations such as liver cirrhosis and arthropathy. It is the most common genetic disease of northern European populations. The principal gene responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis, designated HFE, is located on chromosome 6 in the HLA region. The single point mutation 845A, changing cysteine at position 282 to tyrosine (C282Y), in this gene has been identified as the main genetic basis of hereditary hemochromatosis. Two other mutations, 187G, a histidine to aspartate at amino acid 63 (H63D), and 193T, a serine to cysteine at amino acid 65 (S65C), appear to be associated with milder forms of hereditary hemochromatosis. There is a high prevalence of the C282Y mutation in northern European populations, whereas in those of the Mediterranean basin the prevalence seems low and almost absent in Far East countries. This mutation seems usually to occur on the ancestral haplotype 7.1. Accordingly, a Celtic origin of this mutation has been suggested. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of HFE gene mutations in five geographic regions in Italy. Samples were tested for C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations of the HFE gene according to methods of each laboratory and the results were standardized with the exchange of typed samples between the different laboratories. In addition, C282Y-positive DNA samples were typed for D6S105 allele 8 and HLA-A3 by ARMS-PCR. We have found that the allele frequency of the C282Y mutation decreases from northeast Italy (Friuli, 6%) to northwest Italy (Piedmont, 4.8%) and to central Italy (Emilia-Romagna, 1.7%). However, this mutation is lacking in the two regions of the Mediterranean basin's center (Sicily and Sardinia). Accordingly, a significant difference in the frequency of the mutation was observed between these Italian regions (P = 0.07 x 10(-3)). In contrast, no difference was observed in allele frequency of H63D in the five Italian regions. Finally, as regards the S65C mutation a very low frequency was observed in Friuli, Emilia-Romagna, and Sardinia, whereas in Sicily and Piedmont we have not found this mutation. In conclusion, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the C282Y mutation occurred in Caucasian populations of Celtic origin, whereas the H63D mutation is more ancient as demonstrated by the ubiquitous distribution.	12547216
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Seeking candidate mutations that affect iron homeostasis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by marked variation of expression of the defect: very few homozygotes with the C282Y/C282Y HFE genotype have full-blown clinical disease, a larger number show biochemical stigmata of iron overload, and some seem normal biochemically. The following candidate genes have been examined in detail to determine whether polymorphisms in them may be responsible for this variation: transferrin, transferrin receptor 1, transferrin receptor 2, ferritin-L, ferritin-H, IRP1, IRP2, HFE, beta(2) microglobulin, mobilferrin/calreticulin, ceruloplasmin, ferroportin, NRAMP1, NRAMP2 (DMT1), haptoglobin, heme oxygenase-1, heme oxygenase-2, hepcidin, USF2, ZIRTL, duodenal cytochrome b ferric reductase (DCYTB), TNFalpha, keratin 8, and keratin 18. The coding sequence, exon-intron junctions, and promoters of each of these genes was sequenced in DNA from 20 subjects: 5 HFE C282Y/C282Y with clinical disease, 5 HFE C282Y/C282Y with normal/low ferritin levels and no disease, 5 wt/wt with high ferritin and transferrin saturation, and 5 wt/wt normal controls. When coding or promoter polymorphisms were encountered, DNA from large numbers of ethnically defined subjects was examined for these polymorphisms and a relationship between their existence and abnormalities of iron homeostasis was sought. Only in the case of one transferrin mutation did we find a strong relationship between the polymorphism and iron deficiency anemia. The putative genes that affect the expression of HFE mutations remain elusive.	12547238
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and putative stimulator of Fe transport (SFT) expression in iron deficiency and overload: an overview.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Transferrin Receptor 1 (TfR1) and putative Stimulator of Fe Transport (SFT) represent two different proteins involved in iron metabolism in mammalian cells. The expression of TfR1 in the duodenum of subjects with normal body iron stores has been mainly localized in the basolateral portion of the cytoplasm of crypt cells, supporting the idea that this molecule may be involved in the sensing of body iron stores. In iron deficiency anemia TfR1 expression demonstrated an inverse relationship with body iron stores as assessed by immunohistochemistry with anti-TfR1 antibodies. In iron overload, TfR1 expression in the duodenum differed according to the presence or absence of the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, being increased in HFE-related hemochromatosis and similar to controls in non-HFE-related iron overload. SFT is characterized by its ability to increase iron transport both through the transferrin dependent and independent uptake, and could thus affect iron absorption in the intestine. Immunohistochemistry using anti-SFT antibodies which recognize a putative stimulator of Fe transport of approximately 80 KDa revealed a localization of this protein in the apical part of the cytoplasm of enterocytes localized at the tip of the villi. The expression of the protein recognized by these antibodies was increased in iron deficiency, as well as in patients carrying the C282Y HFE mutation. Thus, the increased expression of both proteins only in patients with HFE-related hemochromatosis suggests that other factors should be involved in determining non-HFE-related iron overload.	12547240
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Stroke in young patients with hyperhomocysteinemia due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency.	Neurology	2003	8.17	Although hyperhomocyst(e)inemia (Hyper-Hcy) may predispose to atherosclerosis and venous thrombosis, the mechanisms of stroke associated with Hyper-Hcy are not defined. Clinical and biochemical phenotypes and genetic features of three unrelated patients with premature stroke and severe Hyper-Hcy due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency are described. Plasma Hcy and amino acids were measured by fluorescence polarization immune assay and ion exchange chromatography. Analysis of the CBS and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genes was performed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequence analysis. Two of the three index cases had no known diagnosis of homocystinuria and initially presented with embolic cerebral and retinal infarction in mid-adulthood. Mechanisms of cerebrovascular disease were carotid intraluminal thrombosis, arterial dissection, and possible cardiac embolism. Family screening revealed additional members with clinically silent homocystinuria and severe Hyper-Hcy. Excluding tall stature in two individuals, all had mild phenotypes, without classic findings of CBS deficiency. Plasma total and free Hcy, methionine, and urine Hcy were elevated. Genotyping revealed heterozygous CBS mutations (I278T, D444N, G307S) in affected individuals. Artery-to-artery embolism and dissection may cause stroke in young adults with homocystinuria. The results also support a rationale for screening for Hyper-Hcy in young adults with stroke without a phenotype suggestive of classic homocystinuria.	12552044
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of mutations related to hereditary haemochromatosis in northwestern Poland.	Journal of applied genetics	2008	1.93	Hereditary haemochromatosis has been linked with C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. In Europe, frequencies of these mutations are the highest in Northern European countries and gradually decrease southwards. We analysed the prevalence of HFE mutations in 1517 DNA samples, including 1000 samples from the general population (subjects registered at general practitioner practices) in northwestern Poland, and 517 samples of cord blood from the same region. We identified 2 (0.13%) homozygotes and 117 (7.8%) heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation. As regards the H63D mutation (1505 DNA samples analysed), 38 (2.5%) samples were homozygotes and 380 (25%) were heterozygotes. Twenty-one (1.4%) compound heterozygotes were found. These results correspond well with data from other Central European countries and seem to confirm the hypothesis of North-South spread of the C282Y mutation.	18263976
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of the HFE C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in Brazilian malaria patients and blood donors from the Amazon region.	Genetics and molecular research : GMR	2008	0.76	Malaria is an endemic parasitosis and its causitive agent, Plasmodium, has a metabolism linked to iron supply. HFE is a gene with the polymorphisms C282Y and H63D, which are associated with a progressive iron accumulation in the organism leading to a disease called hereditary hemochromatosis. The aim of the present study was to determine the allelic and genotypic frequencies of the HFE gene polymorphisms in malaria patients and blood donors from the Brazilian Amazon region. We screened 400 blood donors and 400 malaria patients for the HFE C282Y and H63D polymorphisms from four states of the Brazilian Amazon region by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. We did not find any C282Y homozygous individuals, and the only five heterozygous individuals detected were from Pará State. The most frequent genotype in the North region of Brazil was the H63D heterozygote, in both study groups. Our results contribute to the concept that the Brazilian Amazon region should not be regarded as a single entity in South America. These polymorphisms did not influence the symptoms of malaria in the population studied, as neither severe signs nor high parasitemia were observed. Therefore, different hereditary hemochromatosis diagnostic and control measures must be developed and applied within its diverse locations. Investigations are currently being carried out in our laboratory in order to determine the importance of the coexistence of hereditary hemochromatosis in patients affected by parasitic diseases, such as malaria.	18273820
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Post-prandial iron absorption in humans: comparison between HFE genotypes and iron deficiency anaemia.	Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)	2008	0.5	Measurement of serum iron increase after ingestion of a meal could be an efficient method of comparing post-prandial iron absorption between groups of individuals. We determined whether the rise in post-prandial serum iron is increased in fully treated patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HFE C282Y+/+; HH) compared to iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), iron-replete heterozygous subjects (HFE C282Y+/-) and iron-replete controls (HFE C282Y-/-). Serum iron increase was measured over 4h after a meal containing 13.1 mg non-haem iron. Post-prandial increase in serum iron was similar in treated HH versus IDA (P=0.54), but greater than control subjects (P<0.0001). In five HH patients, using (58)Fe as a tracer, the rate of iron absorption was increased (P<0.05) and serum non-transferrin bound iron showed a tendency to increase (P=0.06). Serum iron curves did not differ for heterozygous subjects and controls (P=0.65). Using the serum iron method we found a comparable increase in post-prandial iron absorption in treated HH and IDA compared with controls. While post-prandial iron absorption in the group heterozygous for the C282Y mutation was modestly increased relative to controls, this difference was not statistically significant.	18276042
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Directions for clinical practice improvement in HFE gene mutation testing.	The Medical journal of Australia	2007	0.5	To audit the clinical indications for HFE gene mutation testing in a consecutive series of requests. Retrospective audit of reasons prompting 187 HFE test requests received between June 2003 and June 2005, by examination of the request form, hospital notes (when available) and, when required, information from the referring doctor. A tertiary care public teaching hospital laboratory, Perth, Western Australia. Reasons prompting requests for HFE genotype testing and compliance with accepted clinical indications (biochemical evidence of iron overload on repeated samples, or a first-degree relative with either haemochromatosis or a C282Y mutation). Insufficient clinical details in requests prevented the inclusion of interpretive comments in HFE genotype reports in 70 of 187 cases (37%). Re-evaluation after collation of the missing details for all but seven requests revealed that 103 of the 180 auditable requests (57%) had been prompted for reasons other than biochemical evidence of iron accumulation or family history. A substantial proportion of HFE genotype test requests are made for inappropriate reasons. Clinical practice could be improved by educating doctors on the practical utility of this genetic test and by laboratories taking steps to secure the clinical information needed to include appropriate interpretive comments in their reports.	17874981
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron stores and HFE genotypes are not related to increased risk of ischemic stroke. A prospective nested case-referent study.	Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland)	2007	0.5	High iron levels can increase the formation of noxious oxygen radicals, which are thought to contribute to cerebrovascular disease. The aim of this prospective study was to determine if iron status and HFE genotypes constitute risk factors for stroke. First-ever stroke cases (231 ischemic and 42 hemorrhagic) and matched double referents from the population-based Northern Sweden cohorts were studied in a nested case-referent setting. For total iron binding capacity, an increased risk of ischemic stroke was seen in the highest quartile (OR 1.80; 95% CI 1.14-2.83; p for trend 0.012). The highest quartile of transferrin iron saturation showed a decreased risk of ischemic stroke in men (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.22-0.87; p for trend 0.028), but not in women. There was an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in the second (OR 4.07; 95% CI 1.09-15.20) and third quartile (OR 4.22; 95% CI 1.08-16.42) of ferritin. Neither quartiles of plasma iron concentrations nor the HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes were associated with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Iron stores were not positively related to increased risk of ischemic stroke. Furthermore, HFE genotypes did not influence the risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.	17878720
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis: an endocrine liver disease.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2007	0.5	This review acknowledges the recent and dramatic advancement in the field of hemochromatosis and highlights the surprising analogies with a prototypic endocrine disease, diabetes. The term hemochromatosis should refer to a unique clinicopathologic subset of iron-overload syndromes that currently includes the disorder related to the C282Y homozygote mutation of the hemochromatosis protein HFE (by far the most common form of hemochromatosis) and the rare disorders more recently attributed to the loss of transferrin receptor 2, HAMP (hepcidin antimicrobial peptide), or hemojuvelin or to certain ferroportin mutations. The defining characteristic of this subset is failure to prevent unneeded iron from entering the circulatory pool as a result of genetic changes compromising the synthesis or activity of hepcidin, the iron hormone. Like diabetes, hemochromatosis results from the complex, nonlinear interaction between genetic and acquired factors. Depending on the underlying mutation, the coinheritance of modifier genes, the presence of nongenetic hepcidin inhibitors, and other host-related factors, the clinical manifestation may vary from simple biochemical abnormalities to severe multiorgan disease. The recognition of the endocrine nature of hemochromatosis suggests intriguing possibilities for new and more effective approaches to diagnosis and treatment.	17886335
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis should be considered a conformational disorder.	Medical hypotheses	2008	1.14	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic disease associated with iron overload, in which individuals homozygous for the mutant C282Y HFE associated allele are at risk of developing liver disease, diabetes and arthritis. Conformational diseases are a class of disorders associated with the expression of misfolded protein and examples include conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Z alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and Huntington's diseases. HFE C282Y is a mutant protein that does not fold correctly forming aggregates and is retained in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER). Consequently, we propose that HH associated with the C282Y HFE mutation should be considered a conformational disorder.	17904763
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Vibrio vulnificus septicemia in a patient with the hemochromatosis HFE C282Y mutation.	Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine	2001	2.63	Vibrio vulnificus is an extremely invasive gram-negative bacillus found in marine waters that causes overwhelming bacteremia and shock that is associated with high mortality. Impaired iron metabolism has been implicated in the susceptibility to V vulnificus bacterial infections. We report a case of fatal V vulnificus sepsis in a 56-year-old man who died within 1 to 3 days after consuming raw seafood. At autopsy, he was found to have micronodular cirrhosis and iron overload. Postmortem genetic analysis revealed the presence of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) C282Y mutation. To our knowledge, this is this first documented fatal case of V vulnificus infection in a patient proven to carry the HFE C282Y mutation. Because this patient was heterozygous for the major hereditary hemochromatosis mutation and was not previously diagnosed with clinical iron overload, the spectrum of clinical susceptibilities to V vulnificus infection may include carriers of the C282Y mutation.	11473471
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Inheritance of two HFE mutations in African Americans: cases with hemochromatosis phenotypes and estimates of hemochromatosis phenotype frequency.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics		7.71	Two unrelated African Americans had hemochromatosis phenotypes and genotypes. We sought to identify origins of their HFE mutations and estimate frequencies of similar cases. HFE and HLA genotyping were performed in index cases and family members. HFE genotypes of 1,373 African American controls in five regions were tabulated. Index cases had C282Y/C282Y and C282Y/H63D, respectively; each corresponding Ch6p was likely of Caucasian origin. In controls, frequencies of hemochromatosis-associated genotypes were as follows: C282Y/C282Y, 0.00011; C282Y/H63D, 0.00067; and H63D/H63D, 0.00101. Penetrance-adjusted estimates indicate that approximately 9 African Americans per 100,000 have a hemochromatosis phenotype and two common HFE mutations. Hemochromatosis-associated genotype frequencies varied 11.7-fold across regions.	11478530
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene and hereditary hemochromatosis: a HuGE review. Human Genome Epidemiology.	American journal of epidemiology	2001	5.04	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism characterized by increased iron absorption and deposition in the liver, pancreas, heart, joints, and pituitary gland. Without treatment, death may occur from cirrhosis, primary liver cancer, diabetes, or cardiomyopathy. In 1996, HFE, the gene for HHC, was mapped on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21.3). Two of the 37 allelic variants of HFE described to date (C282Y and H63D) are significantly correlated with HHC. Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation was found in 52-100% of previous studies on clinically diagnosed probands. In this review, 5% of HHC probands were found to be compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D), and 1.5% were homozygous for the H63D mutation; 3.6% were C282Y heterozygotes, and 5.2% were H63D heterozygotes. In 7% of cases, C282Y and H63D mutations were not present. In the general population, the frequency of the C282Y/C282Y genotype is 0.4%. C282Y heterozygosity ranges from 9.2% in Europeans to nil in Asian, Indian subcontinent, African/Middle Eastern, and Australasian populations. The H63D carrier frequency is 22% in European populations. Accurate data on the penetrance of the different HFE genotypes are not available. Extrapolating from limited clinical observations in screening studies, an estimated 40--70% of persons with the C282Y homozygous genotype will develop clinical evidence of iron overload. A smaller proportion will die from complications of iron overload. To date, population screening for HHC is not recommended because of uncertainties about optimal screening strategies, optimal care for susceptible persons, laboratory standardization, and the potential for stigmatization or discrimination.	11479183
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron status and HFE genotype in erythrocyte pyruvate kinase deficiency: study of Italian cases.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	We evaluated the iron status and searched for mutations C282Y and H63D in the hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) in 34 pyruvate kinase (PK)-deficient patients from 29 unrelated families. Nine had received multiple transfusions. Thirteen of the 25 nontransfused patients displayed increased serum ferritin concentration, in the absence of conditions known to raise this parameter. HFE genotype was abnormal in 9 of 34 patients. The allele frequency was 1.8% for mutation 845G--> (C282Y) and 16.1% for mutation 187C-->G (H63D). Nontransfused subjects with abnormal genotype had serum ferritin and transferrin saturation values significantly higher than those with wild-type genotype. Of the 12 adult nontransfused patients with increased iron status parameters, 1 was C282Y homozygous, 1 compound heterozygous for C282Y and H63D, 3 H63D heterozygous, and 7 had a normal HFE genotype. Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were not related to hemoglobin, reticulocytes, and bilirubin concentration. At multivariate analysis serum ferritin was independently associated with age and gender, but not with splenectomy and HFE genotypes. The retrospective evaluation of the iron status profile of 10 patients (3 with abnormal and 7 with wild-type HFE genotype) with at least 10 years follow-up showed that overt iron accumulation requiring iron chelation had occurred only in the 3 patients (2 of whom were splenectomized) with the mutated HFE gene.	11482880
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Body iron stores and iron restoration rate in Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis C as measured during therapeutic iron removal revealed neither increased body iron stores nor effects of C282Y and H63D mutations on iron indices.	Nagoya journal of medical science	2001	0.5	Information on the level of iron stores in chronic hepatitis C is clinically important because its reduction is technically simple and therapeutically effective. This study was performed to measure the levels of iron stores from the total amounts of hemoglobin removed during iron reduction therapy. The C282Y and H63D mutations of HFE gene were analyzed in 94 patients. All of the patients were negative for C282Y mutation. One patient was homozygous, and 4 patients were heterozygous for H63D mutation. The body iron stores and iron restoration rate were measured in 59 patients in serial courses of iron reduction therapy. Mean values of body iron stores in the two groups with and without H63D mutation were 890 and 606 mg, while those of iron restoration rate were 1.85 and 1.52 mg/day, respectively. None of the indices of iron metabolism were different from the reference values measured similarly in healthy subjects, suggesting that the iron deposition in chronic hepatitis C is limited to the liver, probably due to changes in the iron distribution in tissues.	11486601
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE haemochromatosis gene mutations in liver transplant patients.	Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology	2001	2.2	The majority of patients with inherited haemochromatosis carry two mutant alleles of the recently discovered HFE gene. Individuals heterozygous for the HFE mutation could be predisposed to end-stage liver disease due to other causes. The frequencies of the HFE gene mutations C282Y and H63D were determined in DNA samples obtained from 189 liver transplant patients and 225 healthy Finnish blood donors. 5% of the 189 liver transplant recipients were heterozygotes and 0.5% homozygotes for the C282Y mutation, while 16% were heterozygotes and 0.5% homozygotes for the H63D mutation. These figures were not increased in comparison to controls, of whom 11% were C282Y heterozygotes, 16% H63D heterozygotes and 0.9% H63D homozygotes. Among recipients with acute non-A-E hepatitis (n = 31), the frequency of the H63D allele was higher than in controls (21% versus 9.1%, P < 0.01). Perls' stain for iron in explanted liver specimens was positive in 28% of recipients with alcoholic cirrhosis, 26% of patients with acute non-A-E hepatitis and 14% in the rest of the recipients. The HFE genotypes did not correlate with the iron status. Individuals heterozygous for either the C282Y or H63D mutation of the HFE gene are not at increased risk of developing chronic end-stage liver disease. However, subjects heterozygous for the H63D mutation may have an increased risk to develop fulminant non-A-E hepatitis.	11495086
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	C282Y and H63D mutation of the hemochromatosis gene in German porphyria cutanea tarda patients.	Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology	2001	2.61	Patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) have a susceptibility to reversible inactivation of hepatocyte uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, which can be triggered by alcohol, hepatitis C virus, and other agents. Inherited factors that may predispose to PCT include the C282Y mutation in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene. We analyzed the hemochromatosis mutations C282Y and H63D in liver biopsies and serum samples of 190 German patients (mean age 48+/-12.5 years) with sporadic PCT. The hepatic iron concentration was determined within the liver tissue. Age-matched healthy blood donors (115 donors) served as controls. The C282Y and H63D mutations were found in 75 (39%) and 85 (45%) of 190 patients with PCT, respectively. Twenty-two patients (12%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, and eighteen patients (9%) were compound heterozygotes, displaying both the C282Y and the H63D mutation. Within the control group, 3 of 115 patients were heterozygous for C282Y (3%) and 12 for H63D (10%). Serum and hepatic iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, or liver enzymes did not differ significantly between patients with or without HFE mutations. The high frequency of homo- and heterozygosity for the C282Y and H63D alleles strongly suggests that these mutations are important predisposing factors for PCT in German patients.	11499833
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations in the HFE gene and their interaction with exogenous risk factors in hepatocellular carcinoma.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	The possible role of iron in facilitating the development of liver cancer is still debated. The aims of this study were to define the prevalence of the mutations 845G --> A and 187C --> G (C282Y and H63D) in the HFE gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis in Italian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma occurring in cirrhosis and to analyze the interaction between these mutations and other established risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma. The HFE gene mutations, performed by polymerase chain reaction, were analyzed in 81 patients (63 males, 18 females) with hepatocellular carcinoma. None of the patients had a phenotype compatible with homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis. Interaction between HFE mutations and exogenous risk factors was analyzed by collecting information on alcohol consumption, hepatitis B and C virus infections, and iron status at the time of diagnosis of chronic liver disease. This analysis was performed only in males to rule out gender influence on patients' iron status by using the case-only approach specifically designed to estimate departure from multiplicative risk ratios under the assumption of independence between genotype and environmental exposure. The prevalence of the C282Y mutation was significantly higher in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma than in normal controls (8.6% vs 1.6%, P < 0.03). At univariate analysis, iron overload was significantly associated with both HFE mutations (P < 0.0001), whereas ongoing hepatitis B virus infection was associated with the C282Y mutation (P < 0.05). By multivariate analysis, a trend for an increased risk of being positive for hepatitis virus markers (OR 2.9, CI 95% 0.9-9.5) and of having been alcohol abusers (OR 3, CI 95% 0.7-14) was observed in patients heterozygous for the HFE mutations. These data indicate that the prevalence of the main mutation associated with hereditary hemochromatosis is significantly higher in cirrhotic Italian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma compared to a normal population and suggest that heterozygotes for HFE mutations exposed to hepatitis virus infections or who had been alcohol abusers could have an increased risk of developing cirrhosis and later liver cancer than people without the mutations exposed to the same risk factors.	11500061
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Low penetrant hemochromatosis phenotype in eight families: no evidence of modifiers in the MHC region.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	The gene responsible for hemochromatosis (HFE) has been identified on the short arm of chromosome 6, 4.5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A. A major mutation C282Y is closely correlated with the disease, as it accounts for 68 to 100% of the cases of hemochromatosis. Nevertheless, some C282Y homozygotes subjects have no clinical or biological expression of the disease. Moreover, in Northern European populations a large discrepancy is observed between the number of C282Y homozygotes and the number of diagnosed hemochromatosis patients, suggesting incomplete penetrance of the mutation. To localize and identify the modifying genes, we investigated eight families including C282Y homozygous relatives showing no clinical signs of the disease, in addition to the hemochromatosis patients. Genomic DNA from 20 C282Y homozygotes (10 patients and 10 siblings presenting no or minor biological abnormalities) were studied. Five polymorphisms from the HFE gene were determined by PCR restriction. Extended haplotypes of the 6p21.3 region were constructed with 10 microsatellite markers. All the C282Y homozygotes shared the same HFE polymorphism. The haplotypes presented no significant difference between the probands and their unaffected relatives. These studies suggest that neither HFE polymorphism nor genes surrounding HFE are able to modulate HFE expression.	11500063
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Polymorphisms in the transferrin 5' flanking region associated with differences in total iron binding capacity: possible implications in iron homeostasis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	We have identified five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) upstream (5') of the transferrin coding region. One polymorphism is in the 5' UTR at nt +49, and four are in the promoter region at nt -34, -551, -617, and -739, numbering from the start of transcription. The -34 and -617 SNPs are tightly but not completely linked. The -34 polymorphism lies between a conserved Sp1 site and the TATA box. The -617 polymorphism is within the DRII enhancer region. Five haplotypes have been defined from these SNPs by the identification of at least one homozygous individual, and two other haplotypes were deduced from heterozygous individuals. The total iron-binding capacity associated with each transferrin haplotype was haplotype 2 > 1 > 4 > 3. Transferrin promoter haplotype 2 had a significantly higher mean TIBC and haplotype 3 had a significantly lower mean TIBC than the more common haplotype 1. Persons with haplotype 4, which includes the -34T and -617A minor alleles, have a lower mean TIBC but the difference was not statistically significant. In normal individuals, the differences in the haplotypes were not found to be associated with differences in transferrin saturation and ferritin levels. There was no difference in the extent of increase in the mean TIBC levels in individuals with iron deficiency anemia in regard to their haplotype. Furthermore, there was no difference in the relative frequencies of the transferrin haplotypes in the iron-deficient population. In hemochromatosis patients who were homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation, no particular haplotype was associated with a significant difference in transferrin saturation or ferritin levels. In White patients with Parkinson's disease, a disorder in which there is abnormal iron deposition in the brain, the presence of transferrin haplotype 3 was in slight excess over the normal White population.	11500065
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency analysis and allele map in favor of the celtic origin of the C282Y mutation of hemochromatosis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	After the main hereditary hemochromatosis mutation C282Y in the HFE gene was described, we report here the C282Y frequencies for various European populations. The aim of this meta-analysis is to compile the Y allele frequencies of the C282Y mutation for 53 European populations, representing a total of 9265 unrelated people representing control samples. The most elevated values are observed in residual Celtic populations in Ireland, in the United Kingdom, and in France, in accordance with the initial hypothesis of Simon et al. (Prog. Med. Genet. 4, 135-168, 1980) concerning a Celtic origin of the hereditary hemochromatosis mutation.	11500066
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Diagnosis and treatment of primary hemochromatosis].	Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde	1999	0.5	Chronic fatigue, arthralgia, infertility, impotence, cardiac disease, diabetes and abnormality of liver enzymes could point to the presence of haemochromatosis. A patient with one of these symptoms, a normal haemoglobin content, but an increased transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level most probably has a primary haemochromatosis. Most primary haemochromatoses have a genetic background. The diagnosis 'HFE-related haemochromatosis' is made when a homozygous Cys282Tyr mutation is found in the HFE-gene. However, in approximately 10% of the patients with the clinical features of primary haemochromatosis this mutation is absent. The treatment of primary haemochromatosis consists of regular phlebotomy. Liver biopsy is indicated if fibrosis, cirrhosis or another hepatic disease is suspected. Family screening of first-grade relatives is indicated for all patients with primary haemochromatosis.	10422553
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	High prevalence of the hemochromatosis-associated Cys282Tyr HFE gene mutation in a healthy Norwegian population in the city of Oslo, and its phenotypic expression.	Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology	1999	2.2	Previous studies have shown that 5%-10% of white subjects are heterozygous for the HFE gene C282Y mutation, which is associated with hemochromatosis. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of heterozygosity and homozygosity for the C282Y HFE gene mutation and its phenotypic expression in a group of healthy Norwegians. Fasting blood samples were obtained from 505 unrelated hospital employees. Serum iron, transferrin, and serum ferritin were measured. Transferrin saturation was calculated. The presence of HFE gene mutation was determined with a polymerase chain reaction-based analysis. Two of the 505 subjects (0.4%) were homozygous and 75 (14.9%) were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation. Median serum ferritin among the heterozygotes was 59 microg/l, compared with 47 microg/l among individuals without the C282Y mutation (P = 0.12). Median transferrin saturation among the heterozygotes was 31%, compared with 24% among individuals without C282Y mutation (P < 0.001). Twenty-three individuals (4.6%) had a serum ferritin level > 200 microg/l. Eight of these (35%) had the C282Y mutation: two homozygotes and six heterozygotes. Transferrin saturation > 50% was observed in 25 individuals (5.0%). Twelve of these (48%) had the C282Y mutation; two were homozygotes and 10 heterozygotes. Only eight individuals (1.6%) had a transferrin saturation > 60%: one homozygote, five heterozygotes, and two individuals without mutation. Fifteen per cent of a healthy Norwegian population is heterozygous for the HFE gene mutation C282Y. This is among the highest reported prevalence values among healthy individuals. Half of the subjects with transferrin saturation greater than 50% were carriers of the C282Y mutation.	10423072
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Linkage disequilibrium analysis in Australian haemochromatosis patients indicates bipartite association with clinical expression.	Journal of hepatology	1999	10.59	Hereditary haemochromatosis shows a wide variation in phenotypic expression, which is thought to be due, in part, to genetic factors. A single missense mutation in HFE, leading to an amino acid substitution (C282Y) has been shown to be the causative mutation, clearly responsible for clinical expression of the disorder. Since homozygosity for the C282Y mutation can give rise to a disorder which shows wide variation in clinical expression, we investigated the possibility that genetic modifiers of HFE may exist. Linkage disequilibrium analysis was performed on chromosome 6p21.3 in 74 patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation using microsatellite markers spanning the haemochromatosis gene region. Phenotypic expression was evaluated based on transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, hepatic iron concentration and index, and iron grade. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed a predominant ancestral haplotype from D6S265 to D6S2236 covering a region of approximately 5 Mb. The overall LD distribution in this region showed two peaks of highly significant association at D6S105 (2 Mb proximal to HFE) and at D6S2239 approximately 50 kb distal to HFE. Male patients homozygous for D6S105 allele 8, had significantly higher hepatic iron indices than patients heterozygous or nullizygous for D6S105-8 (p<0.038). This analysis indicates that modifying gene(s) or another mutation affecting HHC clinical expression may be located in the region of D6S105.	10424281
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Atypical haemochromatosis: phenotypic spectrum and beta2-microglobulin candidate gene analysis.	Journal of medical genetics	1999	5.65	Beta2-microglobulin was investigated in atypical haemochromatosis patients not homozygous for the C282Y mutation of HFE (OMIM *235200), because the HFE protein binds beta2-microglobulin, and in mice beta2-microglobulin gene knockout causes hepatic iron overload. Six unrelated patients with atypical haemochromatosis were studied. Five patients had normal HFE coding sequence and the sixth was heterozygous for C282Y. We show that the spectrum of atypical haemochromatosis includes two distinct familial forms: juvenile haemochromatosis (OMIM *602390) and a novel form of familial iron overload, with apparently autosomal dominant inheritance, predominant Kupffer cell siderosis, and possible minimal dyserythropoiesis on bone marrow examination. Serial serum beta2-microglobulin estimation showed normal levels in all patients. Southern blot analysis showed normal beta2-microglobulin gene structure, excluding major gene rearrangement. Several corrections to the published beta2-microglobulin sequence were identified, but all six patients had normal beta2-microglobulin sequence. Western blot analysis of serum showed beta2-microglobulin protein of normal size. In conclusion, we found no evidence to implicate beta2-microglobulin mutation in atypical haemochromatosis. Two forms of familial iron overload appear unrelated to either HFE or beta2-microglobulin. Linkage studies are required to identify the genes involved, which may encode novel proteins crucial to the regulation of iron metabolism. Identification of these loci will aid the diagnosis, counselling, and treatment of iron overload disorders.	10424814
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequencies in the Japanese population of HFE gene mutations.	Biochemical genetics	1999	0.95	We studied the frequencies of C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene, thought to be responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), in 504 chromosomes obtained from 252 unrelated Japanese. Allele-specific PCR and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism methods revealed that the C282Y mutation was not found and the H63D mutation was low in frequency (at only 0.99%) compared with data from European people. Since most HH is thought to be associated with the HFE gene mutation, the low incidence of these mutations is a likely reason for the rarity of this disease in the Japanese population.	10429833
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Four common mutations of the cystathionine beta-synthase gene detected by multiplex PCR and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.	Clinical chemistry	1999	7.46	A deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is the most frequent cause of homocystinuria. The effect of therapy is related to the underlying CBS genotype, which makes early diagnosis of this genetic defect important. Our aim was to develop a fast and reliable method based on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry for the determination of common mutations of the CBS gene. We used MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to detect four common CBS mutations (G307S, T272M, I278T, and V320A). The method is based on multiplex PCR of exons 7, 8, and 9, followed by single nucleotide extension in the presence of dideoxy NTPs of four primers targeted at the separate mutation sites. The extension products, as well as the 3-hydroxypicolinic acid matrix, were incubated with cation-exchange beads to remove disturbing salt contaminants. The above-mentioned mutations were determined in samples from 12 homocystinuria patients. The MALDI-TOF spectra allowed unambiguous discrimination between primers and extension products (>9 Da) in the mass range between 4500 and 7500 Da. No labeled primers or ddNTPs were required. The genotyping was verified by reference technique. Our results demonstrate fast, simple, and unambiguous multiplex genotyping of four common CBS mutations by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.	10430779
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutation and transferrin saturation in very low birthweight infants.	Archives of disease in childhood. Fetal and neonatal edition	1999	0.5	To determine if there is an association between high transferrin saturation and the C282Y HFE gene mutation in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants. One hundred and forty three VLBW infants receiving recombinant erythropoietin and 3 to 9 mg/kg/day of enteral iron were studied. Genomic DNA was extracted from filter paper cards. The C282Y mutation was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Six infants were heterozygous for the mutation; none was homozygous. Ten infants had a transferrin saturation above 80% at least once. No infant was positive for both transferrin saturation above 80% and the mutation. The data strongly suggest that there is no association between high transferrin saturation and the HFE gene mutation in VLBW infants during the first weeks of life.	10448186
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum ferritin is a biomarker for liver mortality in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study.	Annals of hepatology		1.81	We identified no reports of long-term follow-up of participants in hemochromatosis screening programs. We evaluated causes of death and survival in non-C282Y homozygous Canadian participants in the primary care-based hemochromatosis and iron overload screening (HEIRS) study. Initial screening (IS) included transferrin saturation (TS), serum ferritin (SF), HFE genotyping (C282Y, H63D), and health questionnaire responses. By definition, participants without C282Y or H63D had HFE wt/wt. We linked 20,306 Canadian participants to the Ontario Death Registry for dates and causes of death 9 y after IS. We computed Cox proportional hazards to identify factors with increased death risks and Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate survival of non-C282Y homozygous participants with SF ≤ 1,000 μg/L and > 1,000 μg/dL. There were 19,052 evaluable participants (IS mean age 49 y; 60% women; 93 C282Y homozygotes). There were 988 deaths. Significantly increased hazard ratios for all-cause mortality were positively associated with TS, SF, men, and C282Y homozygosity, and liver disease, diabetes, and heart failure reports. Non-C282Y homozygous participants with SF > 1,000 μg/L had lower survival than those with SF ≤ 1,000 μg/L (p < 0.0001). Nine years after initial screening, non-C282Y homozygous participants and SF > 1,000 μg/L was associated with decreased survival.	25864215
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effect of C282Y genotype on self-reported musculoskeletal complications in hereditary hemochromatosis.	PloS one	2015	3.06	Arthropathy that mimics osteoarthritis (OA) and osteoporosis (OP) is considered a complication of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). We have limited data comparing OA and OP prevalence among HH patients with different hemochromatosis type 1 (HFE) genotypes. We investigated the prevalence of OA and OP in patients with HH by C282Y homozygosity and compound heterozygosity (C282Y/H63D) genotype. A total of 306 patients with HH completed a questionnaire. Clinical and demographic characteristics and presence of OA, OP and related complications were compared by genotype, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), current smoking and menopausal status. In total, 266 of the 306 patients (87%) were homozygous for C282Y, and 40 (13%) were compound heterozygous. The 2 groups did not differ by median age [60 (interquartile range [IQR] 53 to 68) vs. 61 (55 to 67) years, P=0.8], sex (female: 48.8% vs. 37.5%, P=0.18) or current smoking habits (12.4% vs. 10%, P=0.3). As compared with compound heterozygous patients, C282Y homozygous patients had higher median serum ferritin concentration at diagnosis [1090 (IQR 610 to 2210) vs. 603 (362 to 950) µg/L, P<0.001], higher median transferrin saturation [80% (IQR 66 to 91%) vs. 63% (55 to 72%), P<0.001]) and lower median BMI [24.8 (22.1 to 26.9) vs. 26.2 (23.5 to 30.3) kg/m2, P<0.003]. The overall prevalence of self-reported OA was significantly higher with C282Y homozygosity than compound heterozygosity (53.4% vs. 32.5%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.4 [95% confidence interval 1.2-5.0]), as was self-reported OP (25.6% vs. 7.5%; aOR 3.5 [1.1-12.1]). Patients with C282Y homozygosity may be at increased risk of musculoskeletal complications of HH.	25822977
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of HFE mutations in California newborns.	Pediatric hematology and oncology	2006	1.09	Advances in molecular diagnostics have led to an increased interest in expanding population-based screening to include genetic diseases that occur outside the newborn period. Hereditary hemochromatosis may be a candidate for large-scale screening in populations with a high prevalence of the common HFE mutations. To determine race-specific frequencies of the HFE mutations, C282Y and H63D, the authors applied an automated, high-throughput genotyping method to dried blood spot samples from a representative population of California newborns. In this sample of 3989 newborns, C282Y and H63D allele frequencies were highest in white (C282Y: 5.5 +/- 0.5%; H63D: 13.4 +/- 0.76%) and Hispanic (C282Y: 1.8 +/- 0.29%; H63D: 11.9 +/- 0.72%) newborns, and lowest in black (C282Y: 1.3 +/- 0.25%; H63D: 3.0 +/- 0.38%) and Asian (C282Y 0.5 +/- 0.16%; H63D 2.9 +/- 0.37%) newborns. The estimated prevalence of C282Y homozygotes in this multiracial population is 1.4/1000. As additional genetic and environmental risk factors for HHC are identified, neonatal screening may become an acceptable strategy to follow susceptible individuals and prevent clinical disease.	16849282
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The diversity of liver diseases among outpatient referrals for an elevated serum ferritin.	Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie	2006	0.5	The aim of the present study was to examine the diversity of liver diseases in outpatients referred because of elevated serum ferritin. A retrospective review was performed of outpatient referrals for serum ferritin elevations made to a tertiary care centre liver clinic between 1999 and 2005. Information regarding serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, liver biopsy, liver iron concentration and final diagnosis was extracted. Patients were stratified into two groups based on ferritin concentration: ferritin concentration 300 microg/L to 1000 microg/L, and ferritin concentration greater than 1000 microg/L. A total of 482 charts were reviewed, of which 119 (25%) had ferritin concentrations greater than 1000 microg/L. HFE-linked hemochromatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and alcohol-related liver disease were the top three diagnoses. HFE-linked hemochromatosis accounted for 28% to 42% of the diagnoses in all subgroups. The percentage of patients diagnosed with HFE-linked hemochromatosis was similar in the ferritin 300 microg/L to 1000 microg/L and the ferritin greater than 1000 microg/L groups (P = 0.067). Among patients with ferritin greater than 1000 microg/L, 63% underwent a liver biopsy. Of those with an elevated liver iron concentration (greater than 35 micromol/g dry weight), 71% had a transferrin saturation greater than 50% (88% of C282Y homozygotes and 43% of non-C282Y homozygotes). In non-C282Y homozygotes with an elevated serum ferritin concentration greater than 1000 microg/L, 64% did not have iron overload on liver biopsy. HFE-linked hemochromatosis accounted for less than one-half of the diagnoses in an outpatient population referred for elevated ferritin, suggesting a need to search further for an alternate cause.	16858498
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Molecular genetic diagnostics and screening of hereditary hemochromatosis].	Vnitrni lekarstvi	2006	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is considered one of the most common hereditary diseases in population of Caucasian origin. In recent years, a candidate gene for HLA-linked hemochromatosis, HFE, has been cloned, and a single G-to-A mutation resulting in a cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution (C282Y) has been identified in up to 80% of study patients with type 1 hereditary hemochromatosis. The purpose of the paper was to confirm the importance of genetic testing for HFE mutations in making the diagnosis of hemochromatosis and find out a suitable diagnostic algorithm for the indication of this form of diagnostics in patients suspected of hereditary hemochromatosis. The examination of C282Y mutation was conducted in 500 subjects. The most frequent indications for DNA analysis were hepatopathy of unknown ethiology, liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, bronze skin pigmentation in connection with high serum iron concentration, elevated transferrin saturation and elevated serum ferritin levels. In our group of patients, 29 homozygotes and 75 heterozygotes for C282Y mutation were identified, 10 patients carried both C282Y and H63D mutations of HFE gene (compound heterozygotes), whereas in 386 subjects the mutation was not found. The genotype-phenotype correlation showed that 22 homozygotes had liver affection proved by imaging and/or histologic methods. Except the liver disorders, the most common symptoms of these patients were type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose tolerance disorder (10 patients), arthritis or joint pain (9 patients) and cardiovascular disorders, such as cardiomyopathy (2 patients). Bronze skin pigmentation was present in 9 homozygotes. Transferin saturation values were significantly higher in homozygotes for C282Y mutation as compared to C282Y heterozygotes (p < 0.001), C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes (p < 0.05) or wild type subjects (p < 0.001) respectively. Also serum ferritin levels were significantly higher in homozygotes for C282Y mutation as compared to C282Y heterozygotes (p < 0.001), C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes (p < 0.001) and wild type subjects (p < 0.001) respectively. Our observations confirm that DNA analysis significantly contributes to differential diagnostics of this severe, but in early recognition curable disease. Early detection and phlebotomy treatment prior to the onset of cirrhosis can reduce morbidity and normalize life expectancy. It is readily identified through biochemical testing for iron overload using serum transferrin saturation and genetic testing for C282Y homozygosity. DNA analysis is recommended in patients whose transferrin saturation is 45% or more on a repeated test. General population screening has been waived in preference to targeting high-risk groups such as first-degree relatives of affected individuals and those with secondary iron overload, especially patients with chronic liver disorders and chronic anemia. This screening strategy is likely to continue until uncertainties regarding the natural history of the disease, age-related penetrance, and management of asymptomatic individuals are clarified.	16871764
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of HFE gene mutations and HLA-A alleles in Brazilian patients with iron overload.	Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina	2006	0.5	Hemochromatosis is a common inherited disorder of iron metabolism and one of the most important causes of iron overload. The objective was to analyze the presence of C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in the HFE gene and HLA-A alleles for a group of Brazilian patients with iron overload, and to correlate genotype with clinical and laboratory variables. Prospective study, in Discipline of Hematology and Oncology, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São Paulo. We studied 35 patients with iron overload seen at our outpatient unit between January 2001 and December 2003. Fasting levels of serum iron and ferritin, and total iron-binding capacity, were assayed using standard techniques. Determinations of C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in the HFE gene and of HLA-A alleles were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Twenty-six out of 35 patients (74%) presented at least one of the HFE gene mutations analyzed. Among these, five (14%) were C282Y/C282Y, four (11%) C282Y/H63D, one (3%) H63D/H63D, six (17%) C282Y/WT and ten (29%) H63D/WT. No patients had the S65C mutation and nine (25%) did not present any of the three HFE mutations. Four out of five patients with C282Y/C282Y genotype (80%) and three out of four patients with C282Y/H63D genotype (75%) were HLA A*03. Analysis of HFE gene mutations constitutes an important procedure in identifying patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly for patients with iron overload.	16878186
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Time-course analysis of serum hepcidin, iron and cytokines in a C282Y homozygous patient with Schnitzler's syndrome treated with IL-1 receptor antagonist.	Haematologica	2009	6.67	It is currently unknown if the increase of the hepatic iron regulatory hormone hepcidin during inflammation in man depends on an intact HFE-protein. Here we describe the temporal relationship of serum hepcidin, serum iron and cytokines in a patient with HFE-related (C282Y homozygous) hereditary hemochromatosis who was treated for an auto-inflammatory condition, i.e. variant Schnitzler's syndrome, with the potent anti-inflammatory cytokine inter-leukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, anakinra). The patient had bouts of fever with peaking serum IL-6 concentrations followed by peaking serum hepcidin levels, while serum iron was low. Upon treatment, these peaks disappeared and hepcidin levels became non-detectable, consistent with HFE deficiency. In conclusion, this in vivo human model: i) supports the importance of an HFE-independent IL-6-hepcidin axis in the development of hypoferremia and anemia of inflammation; and ii) suggests that chronic inflammation protects patients with HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis from iron accumulation.	19608676
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum ferritin, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome: clinical and laboratory associations in 769 non-hispanic whites without diabetes mellitus in the HEIRS study.	Metabolic syndrome and related disorders	2015	2.12	In some reports, serum ferritin (SF) has been associated with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. We studied non-Hispanic whites without diabetes mellitus in a postscreening examination. Participants included cases [HFE C282Y homozygosity; and transferrin saturation (TS) >50% and SF >300 μg/L (males) and TS >45% and SF >200 μg/dL (females), regardless of HFE genotype] and controls [HFE wild-type (wt/wt) and TS/SF 25th-75th percentiles]. We excluded participants with overnight fasts <8 hr, cirrhosis, hepatitis B or C, pregnancy, or missing data. Observations were age, sex, C282Y homozygosity, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP), lymphocytes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein (CRP), TS, SF, and glucose/insulin. Insulin resistance was defined as homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) 4th quartile (≥2.70). A total of 407 women and 362 men (mean age 54 years) included 188 C282Y homozygotes and 371 wt/wt. Significant trends across HOMA-IR quartiles included age, male sex, BMI, SBP, DBP, lymphocytes, ALT, CRP >0.5 mg/dL (positive), and TS (negative). Multiple regression on HOMA-IR revealed significant associations with male sex, BMI, SBP, lymphocytes, ALT, CRP>0.5 mg/dL (positive), and DBP and SF (negative). Logistic regression on HOMA-IR 4th quartile revealed significant positive associations with age, male sex, BMI, and lymphocytes. Metabolic syndrome occurred in 53 participants (6.9%). Logistic regression on metabolic syndrome revealed these odds ratios: HOMA-IR 4th quartile [9.1 (4.8, 17.3)] and CRP >0.5 mg/dL [2.9 (1.6, 5.4)]. Age, male sex, BMI, and lymphocytes were positively associated with HOMA-IR after correction for other factors. HOMA-IR 4th quartile and CRP >0.5 mg/dL predicted metabolic syndrome.	25423072
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Metabolic alterations, HFE gene mutations and atherogenic lipoprotein modifications in patients with primary iron overload.	Clinical science (London, England : 1979)	2015	0.5	Iron overload (IO) has been associated with glucose metabolism alterations and increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Primary IO is associated with mutations in the HFE gene. To which extent HFE gene mutations and metabolic alterations contribute to the presence of atherogenic lipoprotein modifications in primary IO remains undetermined. The present study aimed to assess small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, chemical composition of LDL and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, and HDL functionality in IO patients. Eighteen male patients with primary IO and 16 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited. HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D and S65C), measures of insulin sensitivity and secretion (calculated from the oral glucose tolerance test), chemical composition and distribution profile of LDL and HDL subfractions (isolated by gradient density ultracentrifugation) and HDL functionality (as cholesterol efflux and antioxidative activity) were studied. IO patients compared with controls exhibited insulin resistance (HOMA-IR (homoeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance): +93%, P< 0.001). Metabolic profiles differed across HFE genotypes. C282Y homozygotes (n=7) presented a reduced β-cell function and insulin secretion compared with non-C282Y patients (n=11) (-58% and -73%, respectively, P< 0.05). In addition, C282Y homozygotes featured a predominance of large, buoyant LDL particles (C282Y: 43±5; non-C282Y: 25±8; controls: 32±7%; P< 0.001), whereas non-C282Y patients presented higher amounts of small, dense LDL (C282Y: 23±5; non-C282Y: 39±10; controls: 26±4%; P< 0.01). HDL particles were altered in C282Y homozygotes. However, HDL functionality was conserved. In conclusion, metabolic alterations and HFE gene mutations are involved in the presence of atherogenic lipoprotein modifications in primary IO. To what extent such alterations could account for an increase in CVD risk remains to be determined.	25442240
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Decreased cardiovascular and extrahepatic cancer-related mortality in treated patients with mild HFE hemochromatosis.	Journal of hepatology	2015	10.59	Mortality studies in patients with hemochromatosis give conflicting results especially with respect to extrahepatic causes of death. Our objective was to assess mortality and causes of death in a cohort of patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, diagnosed since the availability of HFE testing. We studied 1085 C282Y homozygotes, consecutively diagnosed from 1996 to 2009, and treated according to current recommendations. Mortality and causes of death were obtained from death certificates and compared to those of the general population. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were used to assess specific causes of death and the Cox model was used to identify prognostic factors for death. Patients were followed for 8.3±3.9 years. Overall the SMR was the same as in the general population (0.94 CI: 0.71-1.22). Patients with serum ferritin⩾2000 μg/L had increased liver-related deaths (SMR: 23.9 CI: 13.9-38.2), especially due to hepatic cancer (SMR: 49.1 CI: 24.5-87.9). Patients with serum ferritin between normal and 1000 μg/L had a lower mortality than the general population (SMR: 0.27 CI: 0.1-0.5), due to a decreased mortality, related to reduced cardiovascular events and extrahepatic cancers in the absence of increased liver-related mortality. Age, diabetes, alcohol consumption, and hepatic fibrosis were independent prognostic factors of death. In treated HFE hemochromatosis, only patients with serum ferritin higher than 2000 μg/L have an increased mortality, mainly related to liver diseases. Those with mild iron burden have a decreased overall mortality in relation to reduced cardiovascular and extrahepatic cancer-related events. These results support a beneficial effect of early and sustained management of patients with iron excess, even when mild.	25450707
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Reduced response of Cystathionine Beta-Synthase (CBS) to S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM): Identification and functional analysis of CBS gene mutations in Homocystinuria patients.	Journal of inherited metabolic disease	2014	3.54	A reduced response of cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) to its allosteric activator S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) has been reported to be a cause of CBS dysfunction in homocystinuria patients. In this work we performed a retrospective analysis of fibroblast data from 62 homocystinuria patients and found that 13 of them presented a disturbed SAM activation. Their genotypic background was identified and the corresponding CBS mutant proteins were produced in E. coli. Nine distinct mutations were detected in 22 independent alleles: the novel mutations p.K269del, p.P427L, p.S500L and p.L540Q; and the previously described mutations p.P49L, p.C165Rfs*2, p.I278T, p.R336H and p.D444N. Expression levels and residual enzyme activities, determined in the soluble fraction of E. coli lysates, strongly correlated with the localization of the affected amino acid residue. C-terminal mutations lead to activities in the range of the wild-type CBS and to oligomeric forms migrating faster than tetramers, suggesting an abnormal conformation that might be responsible for the lack of SAM activation. Mutations in the catalytic core were associated with low protein expression levels, decreased enzyme activities and a higher content of high molecular mass forms. Furthermore, the absence of SAM activation found in the patients' fibroblasts was confirmed for all but one of the characterized recombinant proteins (p.P49L). Our study experimentally supports a deficient regulation of CBS by SAM as a frequently found mechanism in CBS deficiency, which should be considered not only as a valuable diagnostic tool but also as a potential target for the development of new therapeutic approaches in classical homocystinuria.	23974653
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Diagnosis and treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis: an update.	Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology	2013	2.8	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an inherited iron overload disorder caused by inappropriately low hepcidin secretion leading to increased duodenal absorption of dietary iron, most commonly in C282Y homozygous individuals. This can result in elevated serum ferritin, iron deposition in various organs and ultimately end-organ damage, although there is incomplete biochemical and clinical penetrance and variable phenotypic expression of the HFE mutation in hereditary hemochromatosis. An elevated SF >1000 mg/l [corrected] is associated with an increased risk of cirrhosis and mortality in C282Y homozygotes.Conversely, a SF <1000 µg/l is associated with a very low likelihood of cirrhosis, making liver biopsy unnecessary among C282Y homozygotes in the absence of concomitant risk factors for liver disease. Phlebotomy remains the mainstay of treatment and new treatments being studied include erythrocytapheresis and 'mini-hepcidins'. Iron overload is being recognized to play a carcinogenic role in hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers, possibly supporting iron depletion in these patients.	23985001
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Diabetes in first-degree family members: a predictor of type 2 diabetes in 159 nonscreening Alabama hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity.	Diabetes care	2014	8.93	OBJECTIVE We sought to identify predictors of diabetes diagnosed before hemochromatosis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We studied these 16 variables in 159 nonscreening hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity: age; sex; BMI; diabetes reports in first-degree family members (dichotomous); heavy ethanol consumption; cigarette smoking; elevated serum alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase levels; nonalcoholic fatty liver; chronic viral hepatitis; cirrhosis; hand arthropathy; iron removed by phlebotomy; and positivity for HLA-A*01, B*08; A*03, B*07; and A*03, B*14 haplotypes. We performed univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS Twenty-three probands (14.5%) had diabetes; 19 were men. Each of the 23 probands had type 2 diabetes. Mean BMI was greater in probands with diabetes (31.7 ± 8.5 [SD] kg/m(2) vs. 27.6 ± 5.1 kg/m(2); P = 0.032). Reports of any first-degree family member with diabetes were more prevalent in probands with than in probands without diabetes (69.6 vs. 17.6%; P < 0.0001). In probands with diabetes, the odds ratio (OR) of maternal diabetes was 6.7 (95% CI 2.3-19.7; P = 0.0005) and of sibling diabetes was 11.7 (3.0-45.5; P = 0.0004). In a logistic regression model, predictors of diabetes at hemochromatosis diagnosis in 159 probands were diabetes reports in family members (OR 8.5 [95% CI 2.9-24.8]; P < 0.0001) and BMI (1.1 [1.0-1.2]; P = 0.049). This model explained 26.0% of total deviance contributing to diabetes. CONCLUSIONS In nonscreening hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity, a heritable factor(s) increases the risk of diabetes diagnosed before hemochromatosis.	23990522
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hereditary and acquired iron overload].	Nephrologie & therapeutique	2006	0.54	Since the discovery of HFE gene in 1996, considerable progress has been made concerning the iron-metabolism and its major abnormalities. Five types of hereditary hemochromatosis are actually known: type 1 (HFE gene), type 2A (HJV gene), type 2B (HAMP gene), type 3 (TfR2 gene), type 4 (SLC40A1 gene). The HFE C282Y +/+ mutation is responsible for the most frequent type of hemochromatosis in France. Various secondary causes can lead to iron-overload: associated genetic diseases, exogenous iron intake, thalassaemia and refractory anaemia, hepatic siderosis, alcoholic hepatitis, cutaneous porphyria and cirrhosis. The deleterious consequences of iron-overload are due to the interactions of the environmental factors. The role of HFE heterozygote mutations is still discussed. In clinical practice, the interpretation of a serum ferritin increase is a frequent problem that needs a careful evaluation based on the tranferrin saturation measurement. Significant increase of both these factors is in favour of an HFE C282Y +/+ hemochromatosis, after exclusion of a hepatocellular insufficiency or a refractory anaemia. Nevertheless, high ferritin is not always a marker of iron-overload. Thus, there are many disorders increasing the serum ferritin levels without iron overload : cytolysis (hepatic...), inflammatory or infectious syndromes, high alcohol intake, neoplasia... Looking for HFE mutations help to separate type 1 hemochromatosis from other conditions mainly hepatic siderosis (metabolic disorders). The identification of rare types of hemochromatosis (types 2-4) is only required in particular cases. The evaluation of the iron overload is now based on hepatic MRI determination rather than liver biopsy. Repeated phlebotomies remain the essential way to decrease the iron overload in HFE hemochromatosis and to prevent the occurrence of severe and irreversible complications (cirrhosis, arthropathies, cardiac failure, and diabetes). Because of the link established between the amount of iron-overload and the occurrence of complications and the mortality over-risk in HFE C282Y +/+ hemochromatosis, venesections must be started when serum ferritin is higher than 300 microg/l in man and 200 microg/l in woman, whatever the clinical manifestations are and obviously before the symptomatic phase of the disease.	17373275
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron-independent specific protein expression pattern in the liver of HFE-deficient mice.	The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology	2007	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis type I is an autosomal-recessive iron overload disease associated with a mutation in HFE gene. The most common mutation, C282Y, disrupts the disulfide bond necessary for the association of HFE with beta-2-microglobulin and abrogates cell surface HFE expression. HFE-deficient mice develop iron overload indicating a central role of the protein in the pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis type I. However, despite significant effort, the role of the HFE protein in iron metabolism is still unknown. To shed a light on the molecular mechanism of HFE-related hemochromatosis we studied protein expression changes elicited by HFE-deficiency in the liver which is the organ critical for the regulation of iron metabolism. We undertook a proteomic study comparing protein expression in the liver of HFE deficient mice with control animals. We compared HFE-deficient animals with control animals with identical iron levels obtained by dietary treatment to identify changes specific to HFE deficiency rather than iron loading. We found 11 proteins that were differentially expressed in the HFE-deficient liver using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry identification. Of particular interest were urinary proteins 1, 2 and 6, glutathione-S-transferase P1, selenium binding protein 2, sarcosine dehydrogenase and thioredoxin-like protein 2. Our data suggest possible involvement of lipocalins, TNF-alpha signaling and PPAR alpha regulatory pathway in the pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis and suggest future targeted research addressing the roles of the identified candidate genes in the molecular mechanism of hereditary hemochromatosis.	17376729
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis genotypes and risk of ischemic stroke.	Neurology	2007	8.17	We tested the hypothesis that the HFE genotypes H63D/H63D, H63D/wild type, C282Y/H63D, C282Y/C282Y, and C282Y/wild type are risk factors for symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis, ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD), and ischemic stroke. We performed an age- and gender-matched case-control study of 701 cases with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis vs 2,777 controls, and a prospective study of 9,178 individuals from the Danish general population followed for 24 years, during which 504 developed ICVD, of whom 393 had ischemic stroke. Genotype was not consistently associated with symptomatic carotid atherosclerosis. The cumulative incidences of ICVD and ischemic stroke by age were increased for H63D/H63D vs wild type/wild type (log-rank: p = 0.003 and p < 0.001). H63D/H63D vs wild type/wild type had an age- and multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio of 2.0 (95% CI: 1.2 to 3.2; p = 0.007) and 2.1 (1.3 to 3.5; p = 0.004) for ICVD and of 2.4 (1.4 to 4.0; p = 0.001) and 2.8 (1.7 to 4.6; p < 0.001) for ischemic stroke; these remained significant after correction for multiple comparisons. Other hereditary hemochromatosis genotypes were not associated with ICVD or ischemic stroke. Hereditary hemochromatosis H63D homozygosity predicts a two- to threefold risk of ICVD and ischemic stroke.	17389307
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Psychosocial impact of genetic testing for hemochromatosis in the HEIRS Study: a comparison of participants recruited in Canada and in the United States.	Genetic testing	2007	0.5	The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study screened 101,168 participants recruited from primary-care clinics in Canada and the United States. The present study investigated differences in the psychological effects of genetic screening for hemochromatosis (HFE mutation analysis) in participants from each country. Study participants comprised a subset of 2,654 individuals who donated blood for HFE mutation analysis. The initial screening and 1-month post-result questionnaires included measures of General Health, Mental Health (SF-36), and a measure of the percentage of individuals who experienced at least one example of worry in response to the genetic testing. Participants reported similar changes in general health and mental health, regardless of mutation result, or country. Although a significantly lower percentage of Canadian participants than U.S. participants indicated at least one negative emotional response to the genetic testing, greater than 50% of C282Y homozygote participants (the gene mutation most strongly associated with hemochromatosis) from both countries experienced such in response to testing. Thus, although not serious enough to affect individuals' mental or physical health, there was evidence of at least one element of negative emotional response to the genetic testing. These findings suggest that population screening for common HFE mutations associated with hemochromatosis risk has similar psychological effects on Canadian and U.S. individuals, although fewer Canadians may experience a negative response to such testing.	17394393
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygous HFE hemochromatosis.	Expert review of hematology	2008	2.44	Following the discovery of the HFE gene, it became apparent that C282Y homozygous HFE hemochromatosis is the most common autosomal recessive genetic disorder in populations of northern European descent, where it attains a maximum prevalence of approximately 1 in 200. Cross-sectional studies have revealed that the clinical penetrance of symptoms of iron-loading disease is relatively low and highly variable. Although there is no standard definition of clinical penetrance, large studies of newly diagnosed C282Y homozygotes that have specifically assessed liver disease have obtained data showing that penetrance occurs in between 24 and 43% of males and 1 and 14% of females. This relatively low clinical penetrance is largely unexplained. Current evidence suggests a limited role for digenic inheritance of mutations in iron homeostasis genes in modifying the penetrance of HFE hemochromatosis. Currently, the single most important environmental and genetic variables promoting penetrance are alcohol consumption and male gender, respectively. With genetic analyses becoming simpler to perform, new genetic modifiers of hepatic iron loading and liver fibrogenesis await identification.	21082925
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	What's new in hemochromatosis.	Current opinion in hematology	2001	3.33	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism affecting approximately 1 in 200-300 individuals of Northern European descent. Over time, the continued deposition of iron in parenchymal cells of many organs can eventually lead to diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy, and hepatic cirrhosis, the last of which is frequently followed by hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the complications of HHC can be devastating, its clinical management is simple and effective if the disease is identified early in its progression. The recent elucidation of the HFE gene has provided insight into the pathogenesis of HHC and provided a means for the early identification of individuals in whom HHC may develop. Two mutations have been implicated in HHC: C282Y and H63D. The former occurs in a homozygous state seen in 75-100% of patients with HHC. The high correlation of HFE to HHC has caused it to be considered as a candidate gene for population-based genetic testing for diagnosis and detection of predisposition to HHC. In addition, mechanisms of iron transport and metabolism are unfolding and are providing clues to the enigma of iron homeostasis and the pathophysiology of iron overload.	11224684
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	High-performance multiplex SNP analysis of three hemochromatosis-related mutations with capillary array electrophoresis microplates.	Genome research	2001	11.35	An assay is described for high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping on a microfabricated capillary array electrophoresis (CAE) microchip. The assay targets the three common variants at the HFE locus associated with the genetic disease hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). The assay employs allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) for the C282Y (845g->a), H63D (187c->g), and S65C (193a->t) variants using fluorescently-labeled energy-transfer (ET) allele-specific primers. Using a 96-channel radial CAE microplate, the labeled ASPCR products generated from 96 samples in a reference Caucasian population are simultaneously separated with single-base-pair resolution and genotyped in under 10 min. Detection is accomplished with a laser-excited rotary four-color fluorescence scanner. The allele-specific amplicons are differentiated on the basis of both their size and the color of the label emission. This study is the first demonstration of the combined use of ASPCR with ET primers and microfabricated radial CAE microplates to perform multiplex SNP analyses in a clinically relevant population.	11230165
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Mutations in the regulatory domain of cystathionine beta synthase can functionally suppress patient-derived mutations in cis.	Human molecular genetics	2001	5.99	Human cystathionine beta--synthase (CBS) is an S-adenosylmethionine-regulated enzyme that plays a key role in the metabolism of homocysteine. Mutations in CBS are known to cause homocystinuria, an inborn error in metabolism. We previously developed a yeast functional assay for CBS and used it to characterize mutations found in homocystinuric patients. We discovered that many patient-derived mutations are functionally suppressed by deletion of the C-terminal 142 amino acids, which contain a 53 amino acid motif known as the CBS domain. This domain is found in a wide variety of proteins of diverse biological function. Here we have used a genetic screen to identify missense mutations in the C-terminal region of CBS that can suppress the most common patient mutation, I278T. Seven suppressor mutations were identified, four of which map to the CBS domain. When combined in cis with another pathogenic mutation, V168M, six of seven of the suppressor mutations rescued the yeast phenotype. Enzyme activity analyses indicate that the suppressors restore activity from <2% to 17--64% of the wild-type levels. Analysis of the suppressor mutations in the absence of the pathogenic mutation shows that six of the seven suppressor alleles have lost enzymatic responsiveness to S-adenosylmethionine. Using homology modeling, we show that the suppressor mutations appear to map on one face of the CBS domain. Our results indicate that subtle changes to the C-terminus of CBS can restore activity to mutant proteins and provide a rationale for screening for compounds that can activate mutant CBS alleles.	11230183
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Is there a threshold of hepatic iron concentration that leads to cirrhosis in C282Y hemochromatosis?	The American journal of gastroenterology	2001	0.5	The relationship between the degree of iron overload and the presence of cirrhosis has not been clearly established in hemochromatosis. Severe iron overload occurs without cirrhosis and moderate iron overload can occur with cirrhosis. Previous estimates may have overestimated the problem because of the overdiagnosis of hemochromatosis in patients with alcoholic liver disease and chronic viral hepatitis. The objective of this study was to determine if a threshold for hepatic iron concentration leads to the development of cirrhosis in C282Y hemochromatosis. This study included only hemochromatosis patients who were homozygotes for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene and had undergone liver biopsy with hepatic iron concentration. Analysis of the thresholds for cirrhosis were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Data were available on 100 C282Y homozygotes (62 men, 38 women; mean age 51, range 18-74 yr). ROC curve analysis showed an area under the curve for hepatic iron concentration versus cirrhosis of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.75-0.96). The threshold for the prediction of cirrhosis was 283 micromol/g. At that threshold, the sensitivity was 85% and specificity 84%. From this analysis, it appears that a hepatic iron concentration >283 micromol/g is associated with cirrhosis. However, the low sensitivity of this threshold suggests that other cofactors contribute to the development of cirrhosis in hemochromatosis. Early diagnosis is encouraged to initiate iron depletion before the development of cirrhosis.	11232708
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Real-time polymerase chain reaction with fluorescent hybridization probes for the detection of prevalent mutations causing common thrombophilic and iron overload phenotypes.	American journal of clinical pathology	2001	2.28	We evaluated more than 450 patients with thrombophilia or iron overload for the presence of a factor V Leiden (R506Q), prothrombin G20210A, or HFE C282Y mutation using a standard method (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-restriction fragment length polymorphism) and a comparative real-time PCR fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) hybridization probe melting curve method. There was 100% concordance between the genotypes ascertained by the 2 methods (at each loci). In addition, phenotypic biochemical laboratory parameters measured on a subset of referred patients correlated with their respective genotypes. In the iron overload cohort, HFE C282Y homozygotes (n = 74) had significantly higher (P < .0001) transferrin saturation levels (74% +/- 25%) than did nonhomozygotes (n = 340; 51.4% +/- 28%), suggesting a genotype-dependent increase in body iron loads. In the thrombophilic cohort, the degree of activated protein C resistance (APCR), measured by a clotting time-based test, was associated significantly with the presence of 0 (n = 255; APCR = 2.59 +/- 0.26), 1 (n = 84; APCR = 1.61 +/- 0.13), or 2 (n = 5; APCR = 1.16 +/- 0.04) copies of the mutant factor V Leiden allele. As the fluorescent genotyping method required no postamplification manipulation, genotypes could be determined more quickly and with minimized risk of handling errors or amplicon contamination. In addition to these practical advantages, the FRET method is diagnostically accurate and clinically predictive of phenotypic, disease-associated manifestations.	11242801
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Decreased iron burden in overweight C282Y homozygous women: Putative role of increased hepcidin production.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2013	0.5	An excess of visceral adipose tissue could be involved as a modulator of the penetrance of HFE hemochromatosis since fat mass is associated with overexpression of hepcidin and low transferrin saturation was found to be associated with being overweight in women. This study was aimed at assessing the relationship between body mass index (BMI), a surrogate marker of insulin resistance, and iron burden in HFE hemochromatosis. In all, 877 patients from a cohort of C282Y homozygotes were included in the study when BMI at diagnosis and amount of iron removed (AIR) by phlebotomy were available. No relationship between AIR and BMI was found in men, whereas 15.1% (52/345) of women with AIR <6 g had BMI ≥28 versus 3.9% (2/51) of women with AIR ≥6 g (P = 0.03). At multivariate analysis, BMI was an independent factor negatively associated with AIR (odds ratio: 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.03-0.71) together with serum ferritin, serum transferrin, transferrin saturation, hemoglobin, and alanine aminotransferase. In a control group of 30 C282Y homozygous women, serum hepcidin was significantly higher in overweight (14.3 mmoL/L ± 7.1) than in lean (7.9 mmoL/L ± 4.3) women (P = 0.0005). In C282Y homozygous women, BMI ≥28 kg/m(2) is independently associated with a lower amount of iron removed by phlebotomy. BMI is likely a modulator factor of the phenotypic expression of C282Y homozygosity, likely through an increase of circulating levels of hepcidin.	23322654
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Influence of diet, menstruation and genetic factors on iron status: a cross-sectional study in Spanish women of childbearing age.	International journal of molecular sciences	2014	3.26	The aim of this study was to investigate the combined influence of diet, menstruation and genetic factors on iron status in Spanish menstruating women (n = 142). Dietary intake was assessed by a 72-h detailed dietary report and menstrual blood loss by a questionnaire, to determine a Menstrual Blood Loss Coefficient (MBLC). Five selected SNPs were genotyped: rs3811647, rs1799852 (Tf gene); rs1375515 (CACNA2D3 gene); and rs1800562 and rs1799945 (HFE gene, mutations C282Y and H63D, respectively). Iron biomarkers were determined and cluster analysis was performed. Differences among clusters in dietary intake, menstrual blood loss parameters and genotype frequencies distribution were studied. A categorical regression was performed to identify factors associated with cluster belonging. Three clusters were identified: women with poor iron status close to developing iron deficiency anemia (Cluster 1, n = 26); women with mild iron deficiency (Cluster 2, n = 59) and women with normal iron status (Cluster 3, n = 57). Three independent factors, red meat consumption, MBLC and mutation C282Y, were included in the model that better explained cluster belonging (R2 = 0.142, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the combination of high red meat consumption, low menstrual blood loss and the HFE C282Y mutation may protect from iron deficiency in women of childbearing age. These findings could be useful to implement adequate strategies to prevent iron deficiency anemia.	24663082
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genome-wide association study identifies genetic loci associated with iron deficiency.	PloS one	2011	3.06	The existence of multiple inherited disorders of iron metabolism in man, rodents and other vertebrates suggests genetic contributions to iron deficiency. To identify new genomic locations associated with iron deficiency, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using DNA collected from white men aged≥25 y and women≥50 y in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study with serum ferritin (SF)≤12 µg/L (cases) and iron replete controls (SF>100 µg/L in men, SF>50 µg/L in women). Regression analysis was used to examine the association between case-control status (336 cases, 343 controls) and quantitative serum iron measures and 331,060 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes, with replication analyses performed in a sample of 71 cases and 161 controls from a population of white male and female veterans screened at a US Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center. Five SNPs identified in the GWAS met genome-wide statistical significance for association with at least one iron measure, rs2698530 on chr. 2p14; rs3811647 on chr. 3q22, a known SNP in the transferrin (TF) gene region; rs1800562 on chr. 6p22, the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene; rs7787204 on chr. 7p21; and rs987710 on chr. 22q11 (GWAS observed P<1.51×10(-7) for all). An association between total iron binding capacity and SNP rs3811647 in the TF gene (GWAS observed P=7.0×10(-9), corrected P=0.012) was replicated within the VA samples (observed P=0.012). Associations with the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene also were replicated. The joint analysis of the HEIRS and VA samples revealed strong associations between rs2698530 on chr. 2p14 and iron status outcomes. These results confirm a previously-described TF polymorphism and implicate one potential new locus as a target for gene identification.	21483845
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A new mutation in the hepcidin promoter impairs its BMP response and contributes to a severe phenotype in HFE related hemochromatosis.	Haematologica	2009	6.67	Low levels of hepcidin are responsible for the development of iron overload in p.Cys282Tyr HFE related hemochromatosis. Every genetic factor lowering the hepcidin gene expression could contribute to a more severe phenotype in HFE hemochromatosis. Based on this hypothesis, we identified a heterozygous nc.-153 C>T mutation in the hepcidin gene promoter sequence in a patient homozygous for the p.Cys282Tyr HFE mutation who presented massive iron overload, resisting to well conducted iron depletive treatment. Our results demonstrate that the nc.-153 C>T mutation, located within a BMP-RE (Bone Morphogenetic Protein-Responsive Element): i) decreases the transcriptional activity of the hepcidin promoter, ii) alters its IL-6 (Interleukin-6) total responsiveness, and iii) prevents the binding of the SMAD protein complex (1/5/8 and 4) to the BPM-RE. In conclusion, our results suggest that a mutation in the BMP-RE of hepcidin promoter may impact on human iron metabolism.	19286879
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis HFE gene polymorphisms as potential modifiers of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer risk and onset age.	International journal of cancer	2009	5.53	Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is characterized by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes; however, variation in disease expression suggests that there are potential modifying factors. Polymorphisms of the HFE gene, which cause the iron overload disorder hereditary haemochromatosis, have been proposed as potential risk factors for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). To understand the relationship between HNPCC disease phenotype and polymorphisms of the HFE gene, a total of 362 individuals from Australia and Poland with confirmed causative MMR gene mutations were genotyped for the HFE C282Y and H63D polymorphisms. A significantly increased risk of developing CRC was observed for H63D homozygotes when compared with combined wild-type homozygotes and heterozygotes (hazard ratio = 2.93, p = 0.007). Evidence for earlier CRC onset was also observed in H63D homozygotes with a median age of onset 6 years earlier than wild type or heterozygous participants (44 vs. 50 years of age). This effect was significant by all tests used (log-rank test p = 0.026, Wilcoxon p = 0.044, Tarone-Ware p = 0.035). No association was identified for heterozygosity of either polymorphism and limitations on power-prevented investigation of C282Y homozygosity or compound C282Y/H63D heterozygosity. In the Australian sample only, women had a significantly reduced risk of developing CRC when compared with men (hazard ratio = 0.58, p = 0.012) independent of HFE genotype for either single nucleotide polymorphisms. In conclusion, homozygosity for the HFE H63D polymorphism seems to be a genetic modifier of disease expression in HNPCC. Understanding the mechanisms by which HFE interrelates with colorectal malignancies could lead to reduction of disease risk in HNPCC.	19291797
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Carriers of the Complex Allele HFE c.[187C>G;340+4T>C] Have Increased Risk of Iron Overload in São Miguel Island Population (Azores, Portugal).	PloS one	2015	3.06	Iron overload is associated with acquired and genetic conditions, the most common being hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) type-I, caused by HFE mutations. Here, we conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 41 patients from the São Miguel Island (Azores, Portugal), six belonging to a family with HH type-I pseudodominant inheritance, and 35 unrelated individuals fulfilling the biochemical criteria of iron overload compatible with HH type-I. For this purpose, we analyzed the most common HFE mutations- c.845G>A [p.Cys282Tyr], c.187C>G [p.His63Asp], and c.193A>T [p.Ser65Cys]. Results revealed that the family's HH pseudodominant pattern is due to consanguineous marriage of HFE-c.845G>A carriers, and to marriage with a genetically unrelated spouse that is a -c.187G carrier. Regarding unrelated patients, six were homozygous for c.845A, and three were c.845A/c.187G compound heterozygous. We then performed sequencing of HFE exons 2, 4, 5 and their intron-flanking regions. No other mutations were observed, but we identified the -c.340+4C [IVS2+4C] splice variant in 26 (74.3%) patients. Functionally, the c.340+4C may generate alternative splicing by HFE exon 2 skipping and consequently, a protein missing the α1-domain essential for HFE/ transferrin receptor-1 interactions. Finally, we investigated HFE mutations configuration with iron overload by determining haplotypes and genotypic profiles. Results evidenced that carriers of HFE-c.187G allele also carry -c.340+4C, suggesting in-cis configuration. This data is corroborated by the association analysis where carriers of the complex allele HFE-c.[187C>G;340+4T>C] have an increased iron overload risk (RR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.40-2.94, p<0.001). Therefore, homozygous for this complex allele are at risk of having iron overload because they will produce two altered proteins--the p.63Asp [c.187G], and the protein lacking 88 amino acids encoded by exon 2. In summary, we provide evidence that the complex allele HFE-c.[187C>G;340+4T>C] has a role, as genetic predisposition factor, on iron overload in the São Miguel population. Independent replication studies in other populations are needed to confirm this association.	26501199
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Autoimmune Conditions in 235 Hemochromatosis Probands with HFE C282Y Homozygosity and Their First-Degree Relatives.	Journal of immunology research	2015	2.81	We performed a retrospective study of autoimmune conditions (ACs) in 235 hemochromatosis probands at diagnosis by analyzing age, sex, ACs, history of first-degree family members with ACs (FH), diabetes, heavy ethanol consumption, elevated serum ALT/AST, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, iron removed to achieve iron depletion (QFe), and positivity for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes A (∗) 01, B (∗) 08; A (∗) 02, B (∗) 44; A (∗) 03, B (∗) 07; A (∗) 03, B (∗) 14; and A (∗) 29, B (∗) 44. There were 138 men (58.7%). Median followup was 19.6 y. One or more of 19 ACs were diagnosed in each of 35 probands (14.9%). Prevalences of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis were 8.1% (95% CI: [5.1, 12.5]), 1.7% [0.6, 4.6], and 0.0085 [0.0015, 0.0337], respectively. Eighteen probands (7.7%) had a FH. Eight probands with ACs had 9 family members with ACs. In a logistic regression, ACs were less likely in men (odds ratio (OR) 0.3 [0.1, 0.6]) and more likely in probands with a FH (OR 4.1 [1.4, 11.8]). Overall ACs risk was not significantly associated with QFe or HLA haplotypes. Estimated survival of probands with and without ACs did not differ significantly. We conclude that ACs are common in hemochromatosis probands, especially women and probands with a FH.	26504855
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Health-related quality of life in a racially diverse population screened for hemochromatosis: results from the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) study.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics	2007	7.71	"""The HEIRS Study screened 101,168 primary care participants for iron overload with serum transferrin saturation (TS), serum ferritin (SF), and C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of screening on participants' well-being. All C282Y homozygotes, participants with an elevated TS and SF concentration, and a control group of phenotype-genotype negative persons, with neither C282Y nor H63D mutations in the HFE gene were recalled for a clinical evaluation. Health-related quality of life was assessed before screening and approximately 1 week after receipt of the results. Health worries were assessed only at follow-up. Participants (N = 1478) completed both initial and follow-up surveys. After adjusting for model covariates, phenotype and genotype combinations were statistically significant predictors of changes in psychological well-being (P = 0.0001) and general health (P = 0.0014). C282Y homozygotes with transient elevations in TS or SF were significantly more likely to worry about their health compared to study controls. Race, ethnicity, and preferred language subgroups differed on psychological well-being, general health, and health worry. Iron phenotype and HFE genotype are associated with health-related quality of life. Health worry was greatest among those considered genetically """"at risk.

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Changing aspects of HFE-related hereditary haemochromatosis and endeavours to early diagnosis.	The Netherlands journal of medicine	2007	0.5	HFE-related hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is an iron overload disease attributed to the highly prevalent homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. The pathophysiology of this error in iron metabolism is not completely elucidated yet, although deficiency of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin appears to play a role. Ways of diagnosing iron overload include measurement of the serum iron parameters, i.e. serum transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, by a liver biopsy or by calculating the amount of mobilisable body iron withdrawn by phlebotomies. Clinical signs attributed to HFE-related HH include liver failure, arthralgia, chronic fatigue, diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure. organ failure can be prevented by phlebotomies starting before irreversible damage has occurred. Therefore, screening to facilitate early diagnosis is desirable in individuals at risk of developing HFE-related iron overload. over time it appeared that the clinical penetrance of the HFE mutations was much lower than had previously been thought. This changed the opinion about a suitable screening modality from case detection, via population screening, to family screening as the most appropriate method to prevent HFE-related disease. However, before the implementation of family screening it is vital to have thorough information on the relevance of the specific health problem involved, on the clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygosity and on the effectiveness of the screening approach.	18079564
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Morbidity and mortality in first-degree relatives of C282Y homozygous probands with clinically detected haemochromatosis compared with the general population: the HEmochromatosis FAmily Study (HEFAS).	The Netherlands journal of medicine	2007	0.5	Family screening has been suggested as a sophisticated model for the early detection of HFE-related hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). However, until now, controlled studies on the morbidity and mortality in families with HH are lacking. Data on iron parameters, morbidity and mortality were collected from 224 dutch C282Y-homozygous probands with clinically overt HH and 735 of their first-degree family members, all participating in the HEmochromatosis fAmily study (HEfAs). These data were compared with results obtained from an age- and gender-matched normal population. HEfAs and controls filled in similar questionnaires on demographics, lifestyle factors, health, morbidity and mortality. A significantly higher proportion of the HEfAs first-degree family members reported to be diagnosed with haemochromatosis-related diseases: 45.7 vs 19.4% of the matched normal population (McNemar p<0.001). Mortality among siblings, children and parents in the HEFAS population was similar to that in the relatives of matched control. In this study we show that, morbidity among first-degree family members of C282Y-homozygous probands previously diagnosed with clinically proven HH is higher than that in an age- and gender-matched normal population. Further studies are needed to definitely connect these increase morbidity figures to increase prevalenc of the C282Y mutated HFE-gene and elevated serum iron indices.	18079565
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Synopsis of the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of hereditary haemochromatosis.	The Netherlands journal of medicine	2007	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a disease related to mutations in the HFE gene and can lead to progressive iron accumulation, especially in the liver, eventually resulting in organ damage. We have developed guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease according to CBO methodology (dutch institute for Healthcare Quality). The prevalence of clinical symptoms such as fatigue, arthropathies, impotence and diabetes mellitus among homozygotes was similar to that in a control population. Nevertheless, we recommend the assessment of serum iron indices when these symptoms remain unexplained. When transferrin saturation is >45% and ferritin exceeds local reference ranges, HFE mutations should be investigated. Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation or combined C282Y/H63d mutation confirms the diagnosis of HFE-related HH. Liver biopsy is recommended when ferritin exceeds 1000 microg/l to establish the presence or absence of cirrhosis, which will affect prognosis and management. iron accumulation confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the absence of the homozygous C282Y mutation or the combined C282Y/H63d genotype may justify a search for rare hereditary forms of non-HFE HH in a specialised centre. The literature supports the benefits of adequate phlebotomy and the screening of first-degree relatives of index patients with clinically overt HH. overall, the guidelines presented here are to a great extent based on the expert opinion of the working party, as the quantity of evidence that met predefined criteria posed by the evidence-based approach was small. We therefore recommend world-wide efforts to collaboratively address these remaining issues.	18079569
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Assessment of the psychological effects of genetic screening for hereditary hemochromatosis.	Annals of hematology	2008	3.02	Discovery of genetic variants of the HFE gene has made it possible to screen for hereditary hemochromatosis. However, genetic screening raises ethical, legal, social, and psychological questions, which need to be addressed. To assess the psychological impact on individuals undergoing genetic screening for hereditary hemochromatosis and to determine the effects of providing different levels of information to the participants. Male residents, aged 30-50 years (n = 10,993) were invited to a genetic screening for hereditary hemochromatosis. Carriers of the gene variants H63D, S65C, and C282Y were offered additional biochemical screening using serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Psychological factors were evaluated through questionnaires before and after genetic and biochemical screening. According to genotype, participants were divided into three groups with different risks profiles for having/developing clinical hemochromatosis (at-risk, uncertain risk, no risk). Before completion of the questionnaires, 929 participants received only genetic information and 366 received both genetic and biochemical information. At-risk participants receiving only genetic information generally displayed negative reactions to the test result, whereas participants receiving both genetic and biochemical information were more satisfied and had fewer negative psychological reactions to the test result. Genetic screening is more readily accepted by subjects when genetic information is supported by biochemical measurements, especially in participants with a risk of clinical disease.	18080122
GJC2	c.1193C>T	p.Thr398Ile	Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease is caused not only by a loss of connexin47 function but also by a hemichannel dysfunction.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2010	4.58	Autosomal recessive mutations in the GJA12/GJC2 gene encoding the gap junction protein connexin47 (C x 47) cause a form of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease (PMLD) with hypomyelination, nystagmus, impaired psychomotor development and progressive spasticity. We investigated the functional consequences of four C x 47 missense mutations (G149S, G236R, T265A, and T398I) and one C x 47 complex mutation (A98G_V99insT) by immunoblot analysis and immunocytochemistry in transfected communication-incompetent HeLa cells and in OLI-neu cells. All studied C x 47 mutants, except G236R, generated stable proteins in transfected HeLa cells and OLI-neu cells. The mutants T265A and A98G_V99insT were retained in the ER, T398I formed gap junctional plaques at the plasma membrane, and G149S showed both, structures at the plasma membrane and ER localization. Two-microelectrode voltage clamp analyses in Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with wild-type and mutant C x 47 cRNA revealed reduced hemichannel currents for G236R, T265A, and A98G_V99insT. In contrast, T398I revealed hemichannel currents comparable to wild-type. For C x 47 mutant T398I, our results indicate a defect in hemichannel function, whereas C x 47 mutants G149S, G236R, T265A, and A98G_V99insT are predicted to result in a loss of C x 47 hemichannel function. Thus, PMLD is likely to be caused by two different disease mechanisms: a loss of function and a dysfunction.	20442743
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron stores and HFE genotypes are not related to increased risk of first-time myocardial infarction: a prospective nested case-referent study.	International journal of cardiology	2011	4.64	Our objectives were to study the relationship between iron stores, HFE genotypes and the risk for first-ever myocardial infarction. First-ever myocardial infarction cases (n=618) and double matched referents from the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Cohort Study were studied in a prospective nested case-referent setting. Plasma iron, total iron binding capacity, transferrin iron saturation and ferritin were analyzed, as well as several confounders. HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes were determined. There was an inverse risk association for myocardial infarction in the highest quartiles of iron (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.48-0.96) and transferrin iron saturation (OR 0.62; 95% CI 0.42-0.89) in men. This association, however, was lost after adjusting for C-reactive protein. Women homozygous for H63D had a higher risk for myocardial infarction. No risk association between high iron stores and first-ever myocardial infarction was found. The higher risk in female H63D homozygotes is probably not related to iron metabolism.	20447705
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis.	Journal of hepatology	2010	10.59	Iron overload in humans is associated with a variety of genetic and acquired conditions. Of these, HFE hemochromatosis (HFE-HC) is by far the most frequent and most well-defined inherited cause when considering epidemiological aspects and risks for iron-related morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with HFE-HC are homozygotes for the C282Y polymorphism [1]. Without therapeutic intervention, there is a risk that iron overload will occur, with the potential for tissue damage and disease. While a specific genetic test now allows for the diagnosis of HFE-HC, the uncertainty in defining cases and disease burden, as well as the low phenotypic penetrance of C282Y homozygosity poses a number of clinical problems in the management of patients with HC. This Clinical Practice Guideline will therefore, focus on HFE-HC, while rarer forms of genetic iron overload recently attributed to pathogenic mutations of transferrin receptor 2, (TFR2), hepcidin (HAMP), hemojuvelin (HJV), or to a sub-type of ferroportin (FPN) mutations, on which limited and sparse clinical and epidemiologic data are available, will not be discussed. We have developed recommendations for the screening, diagnosis, and management of HFE-HC.	20471131
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Multicentric origin of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations.	American journal of human genetics	1999	10.79	Genetic hemochromatosis (GH) is believed to be a disease restricted to those of European ancestry. In northwestern Europe, >80% of GH patients are homozygous for one mutation, the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at position 282 (C282Y) in the unprocessed protein. In a proportion of GH patients, two mutations are present, C282Y and H63D. The clinical significance of this second mutation is such that it appears to predispose 1%-2% of compound heterozygotes to expression of the disease. The distribution of the two mutations differ, C282Y being limited to those of northwestern European ancestry and H63D being found at allele frequencies>5%, in Europe, in countries bordering the Mediterranean, in the Middle East, and in the Indian subcontinent. The C282Y mutation occurs on a haplotype that extends </=6 Mb, suggesting that this mutation has arisen during the past 2,000 years. The H63D mutation is older and does not occur on such a large extended haplotype, the haplotype in this case extending </=700 kb. Here we report the finding of the H63D and C282Y mutations on new haplotypes. In Sri Lanka we have found H63D on three new haplotypes and have found C282Y on one new haplotype, demonstrating that these mutations have arisen independently on this island. These results suggest that the HFE gene has been the subject of selection pressure. These selection pressures could be due to infectious diseases, environmental conditions, or other genetic disorders such as anemia.	10090890
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A retrospective anonymous pilot study in screening newborns for HFE mutations in Scandinavian populations.	Human mutation	1999	5.09	We have retrospectively analyzed 837 random anonymized dried blood spot (DBS) samples from neonatal screening programs in Scandinavia for mutations in HFE, the candidate gene for hemochromatosis. We have found C282Y allele frequencies of 2.3% (+2.0%) (-1.3%) in Greenland, 4.5%+/-1.9% in Iceland, 5.1%+/-2.3% in the Faeroe Islands, and 8.2%+/-2.7% in Denmark. The high prevalence of HFE mutations in Denmark suggests that population screening for the C282Y mutation could be highly advantageous in terms of preventive health care. Long-term follow-up evaluation of C282Y homozygotes and H63D/C282Y compound heterozygotes will give an indication of the penetrance of the mutations.	10094552
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	N-Homocysteinylation impairs collagen cross-linking in cystathionine β-synthase-deficient mice: a novel mechanism of connective tissue abnormalities.	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	2016	5.3	Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency, a genetic disorder in homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism in humans, elevates plasma Hcy-thiolactone and leads to connective tissue abnormalities that affect the cardiovascular and skeletal systems. However, the underlying mechanism of these abnormalities is not understood. Hcy-thiolactone has the ability to form isopeptide bonds with protein lysine residues, which generates N-homocysteinylated protein. Because lysine residues are involved in collagen cross-linking, N-homocysteinylation of these lysines should impair cross-linking. Using a Tg-I278T Cbs -/- mouse model of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) which replicates the connective tissue abnormalities observed in CBS-deficient patients, we found that N-Hcy-collagen was elevated in bone, tail, and heart of Cbs -/- mice, whereas pyridinoline cross-links were significantly reduced. Plasma deoxypyridinoline cross-link and cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen were also significantly reduced in the Cbs -/- mice. Lysine oxidase activity and mRNA level were not reduced by the Cbs -/- genotype. We also showed that collagen carries S-linked Hcy bound to the thiol of N-linked Hcy. In vitro experiments showed that Hcy-thiolactone modifies lysine residues in collagen type I α-1 chain. Residue K 160 , located in the nonhelical N-telopeptide region and involved in pyridinoline cross-link formation, was also N-homocysteinylated in vivo Taken together, our findings showed that N-homocysteinylation of collagen in Cbs -/- mice impairs its cross-linking. These findings explain, at least in part, connective tissue abnormalities observed in HHcy.-Perła-Kajan, J., Utyro, O., Rusek, M., Malinowska, A., Sitkiewicz, E., Jakubowski, H.

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Correlates of hepcidin and NTBI according to HFE status in patients referred to a liver centre.	Acta haematologica	2015	1.05	Innately low hepcidin levels lead to iron overload in HFE-associated hereditary haemochromatosis. This study compared hepcidin and non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) levels in untreated iron-loaded and non-iron-loaded C282Y homozygotes to levels in C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes and individuals with other HFE genotypes associated with less risk of iron overload. As the genotypic risk for iron overload increased, transferrin saturation and serum NTBI levels increased while serum hepcidin levels decreased. Overweight and obese male C282Y homozygotes had significantly higher hepcidin levels than male C282Y homozygotes with a normal BMI. Pearson product-moment analysis showed that serum hepcidin levels significantly correlated with HFE status, serum ferritin, age, NTBI, transferrin saturation, gender and BMI. Subsequent multiple regression analysis showed that HFE status and serum ferritin were significant independent correlates of serum hepcidin levels. In summary, this study has shown that while serum ferritin and HFE status are the most important determinants of hepcidin levels, factors such age, gender, BMI, transferrin saturation and NTBI all interact closely in the matrix of homeostatic iron balance.	25277871
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Maternal iron metabolism gene variants modify umbilical cord blood lead levels by gene-environment interaction: a birth cohort study.	Environmental health : a global access science source	2014	3.45	Given the relationship between iron metabolism and lead toxicokinetics, we hypothesized that polymorphisms in iron metabolism genes might modify maternal-fetal lead transfer. The objective of this study was to determine whether maternal and/or infant transferrin (TF) and hemochromatosis (HFE) gene missense variants modify the association between maternal blood lead (MBL) and umbilical cord blood lead (UCBL). We studied 476 mother-infant pairs whose archived blood specimens were genotyped for TF P570S, HFE H63D and HFE C282Y. MBL and UCBL were collected within 12 hours of delivery. Linear regression models were used to examine the association between log-transformed MBL and UCBL, examine for confounding and collinearity, and explore gene-environment interactions. The geometric mean MBL was 0.61 μg/dL (range 0.03, 3.2) and UCBL 0.42 (<0.02, 3.9). Gene variants were common with carrier frequencies ranging from 12-31%; all were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. In an adjusted linear regression model, log MBL was associated with log UCBL (β = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.03; p < 0.01) such that a 1% increase in MBL was associated with a 0.92% increase in UCBL among infants born to wild-type mothers. In infants born to C282Y variants, however, a 1% increase in MBL is predicted to increase UCBL 0.65% (β(Main Effect) = -0.002, 95% CI: -0.09, -0.09; p = 0.97; β(Interaction) = -0.27, 95% CI: -0.52, -0.01; p = 0.04), representing a 35% lower placental lead transfer among women with MBL 5 μg/dL. Maternal HFE C282Y gene variant status is associated with greater reductions in placental transfer of lead as MBL increases. The inclusion of gene-environment interaction in risk assessment models may improve efforts to safeguard vulnerable populations.	25287020
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Modification of the association between lead exposure and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by iron and oxidative stress related gene polymorphisms.	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration	2015	0.5	Our objective was to examine whether functional polymorphisms in hemochromatosis (HFE; H63D and C282Y), transferrin (TfC2), and glutathione-s-transferase Pi1 (GSTP1; Ile105Val) genes modify any lead-ALS association. We measured blood lead using atomic absorption spectroscopy and bone lead - a biomarker of cumulative lead exposure - using K-shell-X-ray fluorescence in 100 neurologist-confirmed ALS cases and 194 controls, the latter recruited as part of two separate studies; all subjects lived in New England. Participants were considered variant carriers or wild-type for each polymorphism. To assess effect modification, we included cross-product terms between lead biomarkers and each polymorphism in separate adjusted polytomous logistic regression models. Compared with wild-type, the odds ratio (OR) per 15.6 μg/g patella lead (interquartile range; IQR) was 8.24 (95% CI 0.94-72.19) times greater among C282Y variant carriers, and 0.34 (95% CI 0.15-0.78) times smaller among H63D variant carriers. Results were weaker for tibia lead. Compared with wild-type the OR per 2 μg/dl blood lead (IQR) was 0.36 (95% CI 0.19-0.68) times smaller among H63D variant carriers, and 1.96 (95% CI 0.98-3.92) times greater among GSTP1 variant carriers. In conclusion, we found that HFE and GSTP1 genotypes modified the association between lead biomarkers and ALS. Contrasting modification by the HFE polymorphisms H63D and C282Y may suggest that the modification is not simply the result of increased iron.	25293352
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	H63D homozygotes with hyperferritinaemia: Is this genotype, the primary cause of iron overload?	European journal of haematology	2007	2.54	Hereditary haemochromatosis is a disease that affects iron metabolism and leads to iron overload. Homozygosity for the H63D mutation is associated with increased transferrin saturation (TS) and ferritin levels. Our objective was to find out if the homozygosity of H63D mutation was the primary cause of iron overload. We studied 45 H63D homozygotes (31 males and 14 females) with biochemical iron overload and/or clinical features of haemochromatosis. The simultaneous detection of 18 known HFE, TFR2 and FPN1 mutations and sequencing of the HAMP gene were performed to rule out the possible existence of genetic modifier factors related with iron overload. Values of biochemical iron overload, measured as percentage TS and serum ferritin concentration (SF), in our H63D homozygotes were significantly higher in patients than in controls: TS 55 +/- 15% vs. 35 +/- 15% and SF 764 (645-883) microg/L vs. 115 (108-123) microg/L for patients and controls, respectively. These H63D homozygotes presented extreme hyperferritinaemia and no additional mutations in HFE, TFR2, FPN1 and HAMP genes were detected. The lack of additional mutations in our H63D homozygotes suggests that this genotype could be the primary cause of iron overload in these patients. Despite our results, we cannot entirely discount the possibility that one or more genetic modifier factor exists, simply because we were unable to find it, although there was a precedent in the HFE gene. Genetic modifier factors have been described for C282Y mutations in the HFE gene, but at the present time they have never been reported in H63D homozygotes.	17042772
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron genes, iron load and risk of Alzheimer's disease.	Journal of medical genetics	2006	5.65	Compound heterozygotes of the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) variants, H63D and C282Y, have raised transferrin saturation compared with that in the wild type. In the cohort of the Oxford Project To Investigate Memory and Ageing (OPTIMA), bicarriers of the HFE C282Y and the transferrin C2 gene variants are at five times greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease; the addition of HFE H63D may raise the risk still further. To investigate transferrin saturation by HFE and transferrin genotype among people without dementia-that is, controls and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-and also among those with Alzheimer's disease. Serum iron status and genotype were examined of 177 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 69 patients with MCI and 197 controls from the OPTIMA cohort. Although each of these variants alone had relatively little effect on iron status, the combination of either HFE C282Y and HFE H63D or of HFE C282Y and transferrin C2 markedly raised transferrin saturation in those without dementia, but had little effect in those with mature Alzheimer's disease. These combinations may raise the risk for Alzheimer's disease, owing to higher iron loads and therefore oxidative stress in the preclinical phase. If replicated, these findings will have implications for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease.	17047092
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Disulone and hepatosiderosis].	Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie		0.58	Disulone (dapsone + iron oxalate) is a sulfone used in the treatment of numerous skin diseases. We report two cases of hepatosiderosis secondary to long-term administration of Disulone. Case n degrees 1. A 51-year-old man was treated with Disulone for a neutrophilic skin disease. After 17 years of treatment, elevated serum ferritin and free iron with hemolysis were found. Liver biopsy confirmed hepatosiderosis. A diagnosis of genetic hemochromatosis was ruled out by the absence of C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. Case n degrees 2. A 52-year-old man receiving Disulone for dermatitis herpetiformis for 25 years presented elevated serum ferritin and free iron with hemolysis. Hepatic iron overload was confirmed by liver biopsy. The absence of C282Y mutation (HFE gene) ruled out a diagnosis of genetic hemochromatosis. In our two cases, hepatosiderosis was noted after long-term administration of Disulone. This complication has been reported only rarely. In murine models, a relationship was found between prolonged administration of dapsone and hepatic iron overload as revealed by hemolysis. Although it is difficult to extrapolate this relationship to humans with any certainty, our patients had also chronic hemolysis and iron overload secondary to administration of Disulone. Moreover in France, dapsone is marketed in combination with iron oxalate, with the attendant risk of iron overload. These cases raise the question of the need for serum ferritin analysis during Disulone therapy.	17053738
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of haemochromatosis gene mutations in Parkinson's disease.	Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry	2007	6.43	The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between haemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations and the prevalence of Parkinson's disease. The HFE gene encodes a protein that modulates iron absorption. Several studies have documented increased iron levels in the basal ganglia in patients with Parkinson's disease. In a study on patients with concurrent hereditary haemochromatosis and Parkinson's disease, abnormal deposition of iron in the basal ganglia was suggested as an inductor of Parkinson's disease. In this study, genotype frequencies of the HFE mutations C282Y, H63D and S65C were estimated in 388 patients with Parkinson's disease and compared with frequencies found in comparable studies. No significant differences were found in frequencies between the patients and comparable populations. This study does not indicate increased susceptibility to Parkinson's disease in HFE gene mutation carriers in Norway.	17056630
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of HFE gene mutations C282Y and H63D in Bosnia and Herzegovina.	Collegium antropologicum	2006	0.5	Genetic epidemiology studies of hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) have shown a high prevalence of the C282Y mutation in individuals of the North Western European origin, whereas lower prevalence of HFE gene mutations was detected in the populations from southern European countries. However, no HFE mutation prevalence data have been provided for the population of Bosnia-Herzegovina so far. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of the C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations in the population of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Among 200 analysed subjects 8 (4%) were C282Y heterozygotes; no C282Y homozygotes were found. The frequency of the H63D allele was 11.5%. There were 33 (16.5%) heterozygotes and 6 (3%) homozygotes for the H63D mutation. One (0.5%) compound heterozygote C282Y/H63D was identified. The observed C282Y and H63D allele frequency was 2.25% (95% confidence interval: 1.2-4.2) and 11.5% (95% confidence interval: 8.7-14.9), respectively. The prevalence of the C282Y and H63D mutations was estimated in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which fit well in the European northwest-to-southeast gradient of the C282Y mutation distribution. In addition, these results have an important implication for clinical evaluation of HHC in Bosnia-Herzegovina.	17058523
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Geographic and racial/ethnic differences in HFE mutation frequencies in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study.	Ethnicity & disease	2006	1.01	To assess geographic differences in the frequencies of HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes in six racial/ethnic groups recruited in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study. HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes of 97,551 participants, ages > or = 25 years, who reported that they belonged to one of six racial/ethnic groups, were analyzed. HFE genotype frequencies were compared among the racial/ethnic groups and among the HEIRS Study field centers within each racial/ethnic group. The distribution of HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes differed among racial/ethnic groups (P<.0001) and among field centers in Hispanics, Asians, Whites, and Blacks (each P<.05). Genotype frequencies were similar among field centers in Native Americans and Pacific Islanders. Frequencies of C282Y and H63D genotypes were greatest in Whites. The lowest frequencies of C282Y genotypes were observed in Asians; Blacks had the lowest H63D genotype frequencies and the highest frequency of the wild-type genotype. Among racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics had the greatest variation in HFE genotypes across geographic regions. HFE C282Y and H63D genotype frequencies vary significantly between racial/ethnic groups and within some racial/ethnic groups across geographic regions.	17061732
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The prevalence of HFE C282Y gene mutation is increased in Spanish patients with porphyria cutanea tarda without hepatitis C virus infection.	Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV	2006	3.03	To investigate the role of C282Y and H63D mutations, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the pathogenesis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). Prospective case-control study. A large clinical and research institute for the study and treatment of cutaneous diseases in Barcelona, Spain. Ninety-nine consecutive patients with PCT and one hundred and twenty-six control patients (76 healthy subjects and 50 patients chronically infected with HCV), were recruited. The frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations in patients with PCT vs. controls and the relationship of these mutations with HCV infection, and iron status, as judged by serum iron, liver iron and ferritin levels. C282Y mutation was significantly increased in PCT patients. This mutation was more frequent among non-HCV-infected patients. Increased ferritin levels and hepatic iron overload were also observed in PCT patients with heterozygous C282Y state. H63D mutation was only significantly increased among PCT patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. No significant iron overload was observed in patients with H63D mutation. This study confirms the high frequency of C282Y mutation in patients with PCT and its relationship with iron overload. The C282Y mutation has a relevant role in Spanish patients with PCT not associated with HCV chronic infection. On the other hand, the prevalence of the H63D mutation seems not to be increased in patients with PCT. The possibility of an association between HCV infection and H63D mutation in inducing PCT can be hypothesized.	17062032
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of the hemochromatosis mutations C282Y and H63D in infertile men.	Fertility and sterility	2006	4.43	The aim of this study was to find out whether C282Y and H63D mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene are associated with male infertility and whether the prevalence of the HFE mutations is higher in a group of 262 infertile men in comparison to 200 fertile men. Because the C282Y and H63D HFE gene distributions in infertile men were not significantly different from fertile controls, our data suggest that the C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations are not risk factors for male infertility and are not associated with clinical manifestations of male infertility.	17067586
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Diversity of cystathionine beta-synthase haplotypes bearing the most common homocystinuria mutation c.833T>C: a possible role for gene conversion.	Human mutation	2007	5.09	Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for the c.833T>C transition (p.I278 T) in the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene represents the most common cause of pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria in Western Eurasians. However, the frequency of the pathogenic c.833C allele, as observed in healthy newborns from several European countries (q(c.833C) approximately equals 3.3 x 10(-3)), is approximately 20-fold higher than expected on the basis of the observed number of symptomatic homocystinuria patients carrying this mutation (q(c.833C) approximately equals 0.18 x 10(-3)), implying clinical underascertainment. Intriguingly, the c.833C mutation is also present in combination with a 68-bp insertion, c.[833C; 844_845ins68], in a substantial proportion of chromosomes from nonhomocystinuric individuals worldwide. We have sought to study the relationship between the pathogenic and nonpathogenic c.833C-bearing chromosomes and to determine whether the pathogenic c.[833C; -] chromosomes are identical-by-descent or instead arose by recurrent mutation. Initial haplotype analysis of 780 randomly selected Czech and sub-Saharan African wild-type chromosomes, employing 12 intragenic markers, revealed 29 distinct CBS haplotypes, of which 10 carried the c.[833C; 844_845ins68] combination; none carried an isolated c.833C or c.844_845ins68 mutation. Subsequent examination of 69 pathogenic c.[833C; -] chromosomes, derived from homocystinuria patients of predominantly European origin, disclosed three unrelated haplotypes that differed from their wild-type counterparts by virtue of the presence of c.833C, thereby indicating that c.833T>C transition has occurred repeatedly and independently in the past. Since c.833T does not reside within an obvious mutational hotspot, we surmise that the three pathogenic and comparatively prevalent c.[833C; -] chromosomes may have originated by recurrent gene conversion employing the common nonpathogenic c.[833C; 844_845ins68] chromosomes as templates.	17072863
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mapping genes responsible for strain-specific iron phenotypes in murine chromosome substitution strains.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	The highly variable clinical phenotype observed in patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) is likely due to the influence of non-HFE modifier genes. The primary functional abnormality causing iron overload in hemochromatosis is hyper-absorption of dietary iron. We found that iron absorption in inbred mice varies in a strain-specific manner, as does the pattern of iron distribution to the liver and spleen. A/J mice absorbed approximately twice the amount of 59Fe delivered by gavage compared to the C57BL/6 strain. Genetic comparisons between A/J and C57BL/6 were facilitated by the availability of consomic chromosome substitution strains (CSS). Each CSS has an individual chromosome pair from A/J on an otherwise C57BL/6J background. We found that iron absorption and iron content in liver and in spleen were continuous variables suggesting that each trait is under multigenic control. No trait co-segregated among the CSS. Chromosome 5 from A/J, however, imparted the highest iron absorption phenotype and multiple CSS had absorption levels equivalent to A/J. Chromosomes 9 and X were associated with high spleen iron content. These data suggest that multiple genes contribute to the regulation of iron absorption and that individual organ iron phenotypes are independently regulated.	17493847
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hypothetical molecular mechanisms by which local iron overload facilitates the development of venous leg ulcers and multiple sclerosis lesions.	Medical hypotheses	2008	1.14	This paper presents a hypothetical model of role for iron in the development of venous leg ulcers and multiple sclerosis. Elevated concentrations of iron were found in the skin affected by venous hypertension and also in the areas of brain with multiple sclerosis lesions. Individuals with hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations: C282Y and H63D, which result in a less efficient transport of iron by macrophages, are characterized by an increased risk for venous leg ulcer and multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a T cell-mediated disease, and T cells probably participate in the development of venous ulcers. This deleterious role of ferric ions could be related to the regulation of T cell proliferation and apoptosis. Under normal conditions excessive accumulation of T cells cannot take place, because nitric oxide and interferon-gamma drive these cells toward apoptosis. However, in tissues with a high concentration of iron, T lymphocytes proliferate instead of undergoing apoptosis. This is possible due to the internalization of the INF-gammaR2 chain of the interferon-gamma receptor, the downregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in macrophages and the inactivation of the active site of caspases. Yet, it should be emphasized that this hypothesis does not claim for the increased concentration of iron as a direct causal factor for the development of venous ulcerations or multiple sclerosis, but rather, iron is a factor that modulates and exaggerates the autoimmune process. Iron chelators, administered systemically or locally, should potentially exhibit therapeutic and prophylactic activity against venous leg ulcers and multiple sclerosis.	18400414
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The biochemical and clinical penetrance of individuals diagnosed with genetic haemochromatosis by predictive genetic testing.	European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	2008	2.09	HFE-related genetic haemochromatosis (GH) is the commonest inherited genetic disorder in Caucasian populations with approximately one in 180 of individuals in the west of Scotland homozygous for the common C282Y mutation. The clinical diagnosis of GH, however, remains relatively uncommon - suggesting either under diagnosis or low clinical penetrance. We aimed to assess the biochemical and clinical penetrance of GH in first-degree relatives of patients with known GH, who subsequently themselves screened positive for the common GH mutations. Individuals were identified from two large teaching hospitals in North Glasgow from July 1997 to July 2005 diagnosed with GH after predictive genetic testing after a relative was found to have GH. Details of patient history, biochemistry and known comorbidity at diagnosis and results of related further investigations were collected. Sixty-three individuals were identified, 31 (49%) of whom were males. Fifty-five individuals (87%) were C282Y homozygous and the remaining eight were compound heterozygotes for C282Y and H63D. All 31 male patients were found to have evidence of iron overload as opposed to 63% of females. Elevated liver enzyme levels were encountered in 15 patients (24%). All except one had evidence of iron overload. Four individuals underwent a liver biopsy, two of whom had hepatic fibrosis. Four patients were found to be diabetic. A full clinical history was obtained from 54 of 63 individuals, 38 (70%) of whom were entirely asymptomatic. Thirteen individuals complained of joint pains and a further nine complained of fatigue. This study suggests that although biochemical penetrance of GH is high, the clinical penetrance is low.	18403938
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic variants in adult liver diseases.	Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie	2015	1.36	In the last decades, understanding of genetic variants contributing to liver disease development has considerably improved through novel genotyping techniques. Genetic variants of single genes are known to be decisive for the development of monogenetic liver diseases of varying severity. Identification of genetic variants is an important part of the diagnostic process, e. g. the majority of patients with high iron [Fe] (HFE)-associated hemochromatosis carry the homozygous mutation p.C282Y. Detection of mutations in genes encoding hepatobiliary transport proteins like familial intrahepatic cholestasis 1 (FIC1), bile salt export pump (BSEP), or multidrug resistance protein 3 (MDR3) is the basis to differentiate various forms of intrahepatic cholestasis. Moreover, genetic variants in a variety of genes are known to act as disease modifiers and represent risk factors for disease progression and the development of cirrhosis or even hepatocellular carcinoma. Success of drug treatment or appearance of severe side effects can also be influenced by specific genetic variants. All these aspects underscore the increasing importance of genetic variants, which in the future may help to identify patients at risk for disease progression or help to guide treatment decisions. In the present overview, specific frequent genetic variants are summarized that play roles in monogenetic liver diseases, forms of intrahepatic cholestasis, gallstone development, fatty liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, and liver disease progression as well as hepatocellular carcinoma development.	26666282
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	High resolution melting analysis to genotype the most common variants in the HFE gene.	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	2011	3.02	High resolution melting (HRM) analysis of PCR amplicons was recently introduced as a closed-tube, rapid, and inexpensive method of genotyping. This study evaluated this system as an option for detecting the three most common mutations in the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D, S65C), accounting for the main form of hereditary haemochromatosis. Ninety samples, previously screened by direct sequencing, and 27 controls were used. The analysis were performed on the Rotor Gene Q, using the commercial HRM mix containing the Eva Green dye (Qiagen). Specific primers allowed the amplification of the regions of interest in the HFE gene. Following amplification, a HRM analysis was conducted to detect DNA variants. The thermal denaturation profiles of the samples were compared with those of the controls. One hundred percent of heterozygous and homozygous samples were readily identified. Heterozygotes were easily identified because heteroduplexes altered the shape of the melting curves, but significant differences were also present in the melting curves of the homozygous carries compared with those of the wild-type subjects. HRM analysis is an appealing technology for HFE gene screening. It is a robust technique that can be widely adopted in diagnostic laboratories to facilitate gene mutation screening.	21627541
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations and transferrin C1/C2 polymorphism among Croatian patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.	Molecular biology reports	2012	1.7	The aim of this study was to investigate the possible influence of hemochromatosis gene mutations (HFE-C282Y and H63D) and transferrin gene C2 variant (TF-C2) on susceptibility to schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and/or age at first hospital admission. Genotyping was performed in 176 Croatian patients and 171 non-psychiatric Croatian controls using PCR-RFLP analyses. Regarding the H63D mutation, allele and genotype frequencies reached boundary statistical significance. Other allele and genotype distributions were not significantly different between two groups. We also analyzed age at first hospital admission as a continuous variable using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis test, and multiple regression analysis. The results of these tests were negative. We concluded that investigated HFE mutations and TF-C2 variant are not high-risk genetic variants for schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder in our population. Also our data do not support their impact on age at onset of the first psychotic symptoms.	21643746
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Four new mutations in the erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS2) gene causing X-linked sideroblastic anemia: increased pyridoxine responsiveness after removal of iron overload by phlebotomy and coinheritance of hereditary hemochromatosis.	Blood	1999	11.84	X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) in four unrelated male probands was caused by missense mutations in the erythroid-specific 5-aminolevulinate synthase gene (ALAS2). All were new mutations: T647C, C1283T, G1395A, and C1406T predicting amino acid substitutions Y199H, R411C, R448Q, and R452C. All probands were clinically pyridoxine-responsive. The mutation Y199H was shown to be the first de novo XLSA mutation and occurred in a gamete of the proband's maternal grandfather. There was a significantly higher frequency of coinheritance of the hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) HFE mutant allele C282Y in 18 unrelated XLSA hemizygotes than found in the normal population, indicating a role for coinheritance of HFE alleles in the expression of this disorder. One proband (Y199H) with severe and early iron loading coinherited HH as a C282Y homozygote. The clinical and hematologic histories of two XLSA probands suggest that iron overload suppresses pyridoxine responsiveness. Notably, reversal of the iron overload in the Y199H proband by phlebotomy resulted in higher hemoglobin concentrations during pyridoxine supplementation. The proband with the R452C mutation was symptom-free on occasional phlebotomy and daily pyridoxine. These studies indicate the value of combined phlebotomy and pyridoxine supplementation in the management of XLSA probands in order to prevent a downward spiral of iron toxicity and refractory anemia.	10029606
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HFE) Gene Mutations in Egyptian Beta Thalassemia Patients and its Relation to Iron Overload.	Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences	2016	0.5	This study aimed to detect the most common HFE gene mutations (C282Y, H63D, and S56C) in Egyptian beta thalassemia major patients and its relation to their iron status. The study included 50 beta thalassemia major patients and 30 age and sex matched healthy persons as a control group. Serum ferritin, serum iron and TIBC level were measured. Detection of the three HFE gene mutations (C282Y, H63D and S65C) was done by PCR-RFLP analysis. Confirmation of positive cases for the mutations was done by sequencing. Neither homozygote nor carrier status for the C282Y or S65C alleles was found. The H63D heterozygous state was detected in 5/50 (10%) thalassemic patients and in 1/30 (3.3%) controls with no statistically significant difference between patients and control groups (p = 0.22). Significantly higher levels of the serum ferritin and serum iron in patients with this mutation (p = 001). Our results suggest that there is an association between H63D mutation and the severity of iron overload in thalassemic patients.	27335591
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Compound heterozygotes for hemochromatosis gene mutations: may they help to understand the pathophysiology of the disease?	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	1997	0.5	Two mutations have been described on the gene considered to be responsible for genetic hemochromatosis, the HLA-H or HFE gene. The C282Y mutation is a disease-causing mutation in most cases of genetic hemochromatosis, but involvment of the H63D substitution in the pathogenesis of the disease is unclear. Compound heterozygotes for both substitutions could help to determine whether or not the second mutation is a worsening factor when associate in trans with the C282Y mutant. We found twenty nine compound heterozygotes during DNA analysis of patients referred to our laboratory for the screening of those mutations. Clinical and biological data were obtainable for 23 of them. Compound heterozygotes could be divided into two groups: subjects with or without iron overload. Five (22%) individuals had normal ferritin levels, whereas 18 had elevated ferritin concentrations (78%). Among those 18 patients, 7 (30% of the total) had clinical and biological criteria of genetic hemochromatosis. Eleven had iron overload without all the criteria of genetic hemochromatosis. Such a high proportion of genetic hemochromatosis is not found in heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation alone neither in our series nor in the literature. Compound heterozygotes for the C282Y and the H63D mutations may have a higher risk of iron overload or genetic hemochromatosis than single heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation. We propose a schematic theoretical representation that could explain this fact at the protein level. Further fundamental studies on the protein, and clinical follow up of compound heterozygotes could help to ascertain this hypothesis.	9410470
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Correlation between genotype and phenotype in hereditary hemochromatosis: analysis of 61 cases.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	1997	0.5	This report assesses the degree of iron overload in a cohort of patients in relationship to the presence or absence of the recently described 845 G-->A (C282Y) and 187 C-->G (H63D) mutations in the HFE (HLA-H) gene. Sixty-one patients with hereditary hemochromatosis diagnosed either with liver biopsy or on clinical grounds were included in this analysis. Forty-one patients were homozygous for C282Y, the genotype considered to be characteristic of hereditary hemochromatosis. At the time of this analysis, 37 of these 41 patients had achieved a state of iron depletion and mobilizable iron was calculated: 19 had less than 4 grams. Twenty-five of these 41 patients had liver biopsies; 4 of these patients had a hepatic iron index less than 1.9. Of the 4 patients with a normal hepatic iron index, 3 had a quantitative hepatic iron of greater than 50 micromol/g dry weight, and one had an inadequate biopsy sample. These findings support our suspicion that individuals may have hereditary hemochromatosis and homozygous C282Y despite relatively low body iron stores. Five patients were compound heterozygotes for C282Y and H63D. Four of these patients underwent liver biopsy; two had a hepatic iron index greater than 1.9. a third patient had a hepatic iron index of 1.3 but a quantitative hepatic iron of 90.6 micromol/g dry weight. All patients were phlebotomized to a state of iron depletion and only one of these patients had a mobilizable iron greater than 4 grams. Three patients were homozygous for H63D; these patients had either a hepatic iron index >1.9 or greater than 4 grams of mobilizable iron. Patients with homozygous H63D and significant iron overload are not well described. Seven patients were heterozygous for either C282Y or H63D; 4 had significant iron overload but three did not. Five patients had no HFE mutations; one of these patients unequivocally has iron overload with a hepatic iron index of 4.4 We conclude that: (1) Identification of HFE mutations will be clinically useful in identifying patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, (2) Patient genotyping will help confirm a diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis in some patients with relatively low body iron stores, (3) Significant iron loading can occur in the absence of homozygous C282Y, adding to the evidence that genes other than HFE may be involved in iron loading, and (4) Homozygous H63D can be associated with significant iron overload.	9410475
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemojuvelin and hepcidin genes sequencing in Brazilian patients with primary iron overload.	Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers	2010	1.3	most hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) patients are homozygous for the p.C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Some studies reported that HH phenotypic expression could be modulated by genetic factors such as HJV and HAMP gene mutations. the aims of this study were to identify HJV and HAMP mutations and to analyze their impact on HH phenotype in non-p.C282Y homozygous individuals. Twenty-four Brazilian patients with primary iron overload and non-p.C282Y homozygous genotype (transferrin saturation >50% in women and >60% in men and absence of secondary causes) were selected. Subsequent bidirectional sequencing of the HJV and HAMP exons was performed. sequencing revealed a substitution in heterozygosis, c.929C > G, which corresponds to p.A310G polymorphism in HJV exon 4 (rs7540883). In the same gene, in another individual, an IVS1-36C > G intronic variant was detected in heterozygosis. In the HAMP gene, an IVS3 + 42G > A intronic variant was identified. There were six (25.0%) patients carrying a heterozygous genotype for the HFE p.C282Y and nine (37.5%) patients carrying a heterozygous genotype for the HFE p.H63D. HJV p.A310G polymorphism and two intronic variants were found, but none of these alterations were associated with digenic inheritance with the HFE gene. Our data indicate that HJV and HAMP functional mutations are not frequent in these patients.	21039223
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between HFE mutations and acute myocardial infarction: a study in patients from Northern and Southern Italy.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	There is interest in the role of iron in age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis. Tissue iron deposition could be harmful, because Fe(2+) can react with H(2)O(2) to form OH(-) radicals and Fe(2+) can react with O(2) to form reactive oxygen species. Free radicals react with cell membranes and cell organelles and could lead to the development of atherosclerosis by initiating lipid peroxidation. Hereditary hemochromatosis provides an opportunity for studying the effects of iron on cardiovascular disease. Some studies have shown that individuals who carried HFE mutations may be at greater risk of developing coronary heart disease than those without the mutations. In contrast, a large number of studies have reported no association between HFE mutations and coronary heart disease. These studies have possible confounding factors, such as the homogeneity of the population in term of geographical origin among others. We studied the relation between HFE mutations and acute myocardial infarction in two case-control studies involving two sets of subjects representing different age groups from different geographic regions in Italy. The first one was composed of 172 older patients (139 males and 33 females; mean age 67) and 207 healthy controls (91 males and 116 females; mean age 46) from Emilia-Romagna. The second one was composed of younger 77 patients (75 males and 2 females; mean age 41) and 172 healthy controls (75 males and 97 females, mean age: 38) from Sicily. All patients were genotyped for ApoE alleles, since the ApoE- epsilon 4 allele is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and can interfere with other genetic and environmental factors by modifying susceptibility to this disease. DNA typing for C282Y and H63D HFE alleles was performed also. There were no significant differences in frequencies of the different HFE alleles between acute myocardial infarction patients and controls in cohorts of both old and young patients. Also taking into account the presence or absence of the ApoE- epsilon 4 allele, no significant differences in H63D allele frequencies were observed. Thus, our study, performed in two samples of genetically homogeneous patients and controls, does not support the suggestion that HFE mutations may be associated with acute myocardial infarction in susceptible individuals.	12850485
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Common variable immunodeficiency and IgG subclass deficiency in central Alabama hemochromatosis probands homozygous for HFE C282Y.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Eight hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity had frequent, severe, or unusual infections and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) or immunoglobulin (Ig) G subclass deficiency (IgGSD). Thus, we performed serum Ig isotyping and other characterization of 43 additional unselected probands, 5 human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings, and 240 consecutive CVID or IgGSD index patients. C282Y allele frequencies were estimated in 58 CVID or IgGSD index patients without hemochromatosis phenotypes and in 341 controls. HLA-A and -B haplotypes and frequencies were determined in all 51 probands, 186 CVID or IgGSD index patients without hemochromatosis phenotypes, and 751 controls. Thirteen unselected probands (30%) had CVID or IgGSD. Among all 21 hemochromatosis probands with CVID (n = 4) or IgGSD (n = 17), Ig subclass deficiency patterns were IgG(1) (n = 5), IgG(1) and IgG(3) (n = 6), IgG(3) (n = 9), and IgG(1), IgG(3), and IgG(4) (n = 1). IgG(2) or IgA deficiency was not detected; one proband had IgM deficiency. Mean values of total IgG, IgG(1), and IgG(3) were significantly lower in probands with CVID or IgGSD. Mean values of age, transferrin saturation, and ferritin at diagnosis and phlebotomy units required to induce iron depletion were similar in probands with or without CVID or IgGSD; phlebotomy had no apparent effect on IgG levels. C282Y frequencies were similar in CVID or IgGSD index cases without hemochromatosis phenotypes and in controls. There was concordance of Ig and hemochromatosis phenotypes in probands and respective HLA-identical siblings. Eight of 240 CVID or IgGSD index patients had hemochromatosis phenotypes and C282Y homozygosity (3 vs 0.7% and 0.2% controls; P < 0.0001, respectively). The frequency of A*03-B*07 was greater in CVID and IgGSD index cases without hemochromatosis phenotypes than in controls (0.0968 vs 0.0546, respectively; P = 0.0032). HLA-A*03-B*07 was the predominant haplotype in probands grouped by presence or absence of CVID or IgGSD. Some probands in each group were A*03-B*07 homozygotes; group A*03-B*07 frequencies were similar. We conclude that serum IgG abnormalities characteristic of CVID or IgGSD are common in hemochromatosis probands, and that the prevalence of hemochromatosis is increased in CVID and IgGSD index cases. These observations could be explained by the increased frequencies of HLA-A*03-B*07 in C282Y homozygotes and in CVID and IgGSD, and by the common occurrence of putative CVID or IgGSD allele(s) on haplotypes bearing C282Y.	12850493
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: effect of excessive alcohol consumption on disease expression in patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation.	American journal of epidemiology	2003	5.04	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common inherited disorder characterized by iron overload. A single mutation (C282Y) in the HFE gene is present in 80-95% of cases in populations of northern European extraction. The disorder presents a large phenotypic heterogeneity, and its expression can be influenced by environmental factors. This 1977-2002 study aimed to identify the influence of alcohol consumption on expression of the disease. The authors retrospectively registered 378 C282Y-homozygous patients treated in a blood center of western Brittany, France. In this cohort, 33 patients reported excessive alcohol consumption (8.7%). Those subjects presented significantly increased iron parameters (serum ferritin: 1745.2 vs. 968.7 microg/liter, p< 0.0001; serum iron: 39.9 vs. 36.0 micromol/liter, p = 0.0040; transferrin saturation: 87.1 vs. 80.1%, p = 0.0071) and elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase: 66.3 vs. 41.1 IU/liter, p = 0.0003; aspartate aminotransferase: 56.2 vs. 34.9 IU/liter, p = 0.0002). Their risk of skin pigmentation was also higher (odds ratio = 3.4, p = 0.0006). Results remained unchanged after adjustment. This study provides precise quantitative data about the impact of alcohol on expression of hereditary hemochromatosis in C282Y-homozygous patients. Excessive alcohol consumption accentuates disease expression and therefore the risk of cirrhosis and cancer. Consequently, these patients should be encouraged to consume very moderate quantities of alcohol.	12851225
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Lack of association between HFE gene mutations and hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis.	Gut	2003	14.92	Liver cirrhosis may lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), regardless of its cause. Genetic and/or environmental factors may modulate the risk of HCC. Mutations in the HFE gene are responsible for genetic haemochromatosis, a condition known to be associated with liver cirrhosis, HCC, or both. It has recently been suggested that the C282Y HFE gene mutation may be more frequent in patients with HCC that have developed in the non-cirrhotic liver than in the general population. Whether or not HFE gene mutations are associated with an increased risk of HCC in patients with cirrhosis is unknown. To assess the prevalence of HFE gene mutations in cirrhotic patients with and without HCC. A total of 133 consecutive cirrhotic patients with HCC were prospectively studied for the presence of C282Y and H63D mutations. The control group consisted of 100 cirrhotic patients without HCC. We used restriction enzyme digestion of polymerase chain reaction amplified genomic DNA for determination of HFE genotypes. Iron loading was assessed on non- tumoral liver biopsy samples from 89 patients with HCC and 73 patients without HCC. The prevalence of C282Y heterozygotes was similar in patients with and without HCC (5% v 4%, respectively; p=0.65) and did not differ from that expected in the general population. None of the HCC patients was found to be homozygous for C282Y or H63D, nor compound heterozygous. The prevalence of H63D heterozygotes was similar in patients with and without HCC (31% v 38%, respectively; p=0.25). No relation was detected between HFE genotypes and hepatic iron loading in patients with or without HCC. C282Y and H63D mutations do not appear to be associated with an increased risk of HCC in patients with cirrhosis.	12865278
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotype and transferrin saturation in the United States.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics		7.71	Examine the penetrance (defined by high transferrin saturation [TS]) of C282Y and H63D in the U.S. population. 5171 participants from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1992 to 1994. 77.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3, 95.1) of men and 51.9% (95% CI, 0, 84.2) of women with C282Y homozygosity had high TS. The associations of H63D homozygosity with high TS were stronger in people aged 50 years or older than in younger persons. Among Mexican-Americans, simple H63D heterozygosity was associated with high TS. The associations between HFE genotype and high TS may vary by sex, age, and ethnic group.	12865759
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of HFE mutations in upper Northern Italy: study of 1132 unrelated blood donors.	Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver	2003	2.72	In the Italian general population, prevalence of C282Y is lower than in Northern European countries. We hypothesised a higher prevalence of C282Y in Northern than in Central and Southern Italy. We previously identified a nonsense mutation (W169X) in haemochromatosis probands originating from a Northern Italian region (Brianza). To define the prevalence of HFE mutations in that region. Subjects and methods. A total of 1132 unrelated blood donors from the Blood Banks of Monza and Merate were investigated for C282Y, H63D, S65C and W169X mutations by PCR-restriction assays. A total of 300 were also tested for rare HFE and TFR2 mutations by reverse-hybridization test strips. Two C282Y homozygotes, eight C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes, 27 H63D homozygotes and one W169X heterozygote were found. The allele frequencies of C282Y, H63D, S65C, and W169X were 3.2, 13.4, 1.3, and 0.04%, respectively. Our results confirm the existence of a decreasing frequency of C282Y allele from upper to lower Northern Italy. This difference is probably related to the larger Celtic component of upper Northern Italian populations in which screening studies for haemochromatosis may even be cost effective. W169X, due to its severity, should be looked for in all haemochromatosis patients of Northern ancestry with an incomplete HFE genotype.	12870733
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Steatosis is a cofactor in liver injury in hemochromatosis.	Gastroenterology	2005	18.19	Obesity-related steatosis is an increasingly common histologic finding and often coexists with other chronic liver diseases. Although obesity and steatosis are recognized risk factors for more advanced fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease, it has not been determined whether these factors influence the progression of other diseases in which steatosis is not a feature of the primary liver insult. We studied 214 patients with hemochromatosis who were homozygous for the C282Y substitution in HFE and had undergone liver biopsy prior to phlebotomy. Steatosis was present in 41.1% of these patients, and 14.5% had moderate or severe steatosis. Median serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and ferritin levels were higher (P < .001), and median transferrin saturation (P = .01) and hepatic iron concentration (HIC) were lower (P = .003) in subjects with steatosis compared with subjects without steatosis. Bivariate analysis revealed a significant association between steatosis and fibrosis (P = .001). Following multiple logistic regression, steatosis was independently associated with fibrosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1-8.8; P < .001) along with male sex (OR, 5.1; 95% CI: 2.0-12.5; P < .001), excess alcohol consumption (males > or = 50 g/day, females > or = 40 g/day) (OR, 3.9; 95% CI: 1.8-8.5; P = .001), and hepatic iron content (OR, 1.4; 95% CI: 1.2-1.6; P < .001). Both higher BMI (OR, 3.3; 95% CI: 1.8-6.3; P < .001) and alcohol consumption (males > or = 30 g/day, females > or = 10 g/day) (OR, 3.4; 95% CI: 1.2-10.0; P = .023) were independently associated with the presence of steatosis. These findings indicate that obesity-related steatosis may have a role as a cofactor in liver injury in hemochromatosis. This has important clinical implications and suggests that obesity should be actively addressed in the management of patients with hemochromatosis, as well as other liver diseases.	16344062
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Late onset of Wilson's disease in a family with genetic haemochromatosis.	European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	2006	2.09	We report the coexistence of Wilson's disease and genetic haemochromatosis in one family. The diagnosis of genetic haemochromatosis was established in a 52-year-old man. Among his siblings, one 57-year-old sister and one 55-year-old brother had decreased copper and ceruloplasmin levels in serum and increased urinary copper excretion. The sister shared the same human leucocyte antigen haplotypes and was homozygous for the HFE mutation C282Y, like the propositus. However, she had normal liver iron content and increased liver copper content. Her dietary copper intake was probably excessive. The association of Wilson's disease and genetic haemochromatosis is rare and has only been described twice. The onset of Wilson's disease after 50 years of age is rare; Wilson's disease should be considered in any patient with unexplained chronic liver disease; an excess in liver copper content might be induced by excessive dietary input in a susceptible individual.	16357618
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Endothelial activation and induction of monocyte adhesion by nontransferrin-bound iron present in human sera.	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology	2006	5.3	Nontransferrin-bound iron (NTBI) has been detected in iron overload diseases. This form of iron may exert pro-oxidant effects and modulate cellular function and inflammatory response. The present study has aimed to investigate the effects of serum NTBI on monocyte adherence to endothelium. Measured by a recently developed high-throughput fluorescence-based assay, serum NTBI was found to be higher in both homozygotes of HFE C282Y mutation of hereditary hemochromatosis (7.9+/-0.6 microM, n=9, P<0.001) and heterozygotes (4.0+/-0.5 microM, n=8, P<0.001), compared with controls (1.6+/-0.2 microM, n=21). The effects of these sera on monocyte adhesion and endothelial activation were examined. Adhesion of normal human monocytes to C282Y homozygote- and heterozygote-serum-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells was higher (25.0+/-0.9 and 22.1+/-0.7%, respectively) compared with controls (17.6+/-0.5%, both P<0.001). For the three groups combined, the expression of adhesion molecules, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin, was positively correlated to NTBI levels but not to the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein. Furthermore, accumulation of intracellular labile iron and oxidative radicals within the cells due to NTBI was evidenced. Finally, counteraction of NTBI-induced endothelial activation was observed using iron chelators. These findings therefore identify a physiological function of NTBI in monocyte-endothelial interactions that may also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases.	16368718
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations in a population of Italian Parkinson's disease patients.	Parkinsonism & related disorders	2008	3.79	An abnormal accumulation and distribution of brain iron are common to different neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), and alteration of genes involved in iron metabolism cause neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. HFE participates in the regulation of iron metabolism, its mutations are primary cause of hereditary hemochromatosis and appear to be more frequent in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, conflicting results were obtained in previous studies aimed to verify if nucleotide variations in HFE gene act as risk modifiers for PD. We used denaturing HPLC for scanning DNA sequence variations in exon 2 and 4 of HFE gene in a cohort of 475 Italian PD patients. We identified the most common H63D, C282Y and S65C, and also other 4 rare mutation types (R66H, R224W, E277K, and T281M). The allele frequency of H63D and C282Y was not statistically different from that of 2 control groups with similar mean age or of a large cohort of the same geographical area. In addition we could not find statistical differences in the clinical phenotypes of patients carrying at least one mutated HFE allele from those with the normal allele. We conclude that in the Italian population, the most common HFE mutations, H63D and C282Y are not associated with the individual risk to develop PD, nor have specific influence on the clinical features of the disease.	18325820
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Heterozygotes for HFE mutations have no increased risk of advanced alcoholic liver disease.	Gut	1998	14.92	Iron overload is common in the livers of alcoholics and may play a role in disease pathogenesis. An MHC like gene, HFE, has recently been identified that is mutated in most patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (C282Y in 90% and H63D in 45% of the remainder). To examine the hypothesis that these mutations determine hepatic iron status in alcoholics and play a role in pre-disposition to advanced alcoholic liver disease. The HFE gene was genotyped in 257 patients with alcoholic liver disease and 117 locally matched healthy volunteers. In addition, iron staining was scored (0-4) on biopsy specimens from fibrotic/cirrhotic patients with and without HFE mutations matched for age and sex. Some 15.7% of fibrotic/cirrhotic patients were C282Y heterozygotes compared with 13.7% of controls (p = 0.77). One control and three patients were C282Y homozygotes. Of chromosomes without the C282Y mutation, 68/442 (15.4%) of patients' chromosomes carried the H63D mutation compared with 36/216 (16.6%) of control chromosomes (p = 0.91). Significant (> grade 1) hepatocyte iron staining was seen in 6/23 C282Y heterozygotes and 4/26 H63D heterozygotes compared with 4/23 controls. Possession of a single copy of either of the two HFE mutations influences neither liver iron content nor the risk of fibrotic disease in alcoholics.	10189855
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations analysis in 711 hemochromatosis probands: evidence for S65C implication in mild form of hemochromatosis.	Blood	1999	11.84	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive genetic disorder of iron metabolism. The HFE candidate gene encoding an HLA class I-like protein involved in HH was identified in 1996. Two missense mutations have been described: C282Y, accounting for 80% to 90% of HH chromosomes, and H63D, which is associated with a milder form of the disease representing 40% to 70% of non-C282Y HH chromosomes. We report here on the analysis of C282Y, H63D, and the 193A-->T substitution leading to the S65C missense substitution in a large series of probands and controls. The results confirm that the C282Y substitution was the main mutation involved in hemochromatosis, accounting for 85% of carrier chromosomes, whereas the H63D substitution represented 39% of the HH chromosomes that did not carry the C282Y mutation. In addition, our screening showed that the S65C substitution was significantly enriched in probands with at least one chromosome without an assigned mutation. This substitution accounted for 7.8% of HH chromosomes that were neither C282Y nor H63D. This enrichment of S65C among HH chromosomes suggests that the S65C substitution is associated with the mild form of hemochromatosis.	10194428
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	"""A genotypic study of 217 unrelated probands diagnosed as """"genetic hemochromatosis"""" on """"classical"""" phenotypic criteria."""	Journal of hepatology	1999	10.59	The HFE gene is a crucial candidate gene for hemochromatosis. The aims of this study were to assess the HFE genotypic profile in a large series of unrelated probands diagnosed as having phenotypic hemochromatosis, to characterize the sub-group of patients who were not homozygous for the major C282Y mutation, and to report the iron status of the detected HFE-identical siblings. In 217 patients, the phenotypic diagnosis of hemochromatosis was based on strict bioclinical and/or histological criteria, and their genotypic profile (C282Y and H63D mutations) was determined. 1) 209 of the 217 probands were C282Y +/+. In 33 cases, an HFE-identical sibling was identified. Two of them had neither a clinical nor a biochemical phenotypic profile of hemochromatosis in the absence of any external factor which might have attenuated this expression. 2) Eight patients (seven males) were not C282Y +/+. Their genotypic profiles were: (C282Y +/-): six cases (four were H63D +/- and two H63D -/-); (C282Y -/-): two cases (one was H63D +/+, one H63D +/-). Phenotypic expression consisted of six cases of mild liver siderosis (among whom were the four compound heterozygotes and one case of alcoholic cirrhosis) and two severe cases of hepatic iron overload (one with alcoholic cirrhosis). Three HFE-identical siblings were identified, none of them presenting with iron excess. In our population: 1) The classical phenotypic criteria fitted, in 96.3% of cases, with a homogeneous genotypic entity defined by homozygosity for the C282Y mutation. Incomplete penetrance of the homozygous status was shown by the absence of the hemochromatosis phenotypic profile in 6% of the HFE-identical siblings. 2) A minority (3.7%) were not homozygous for C282Y. These were essentially men with mild iron overload, and might present with distinct iron overload entity(ies) as suggested by the presence in three of an HFE-identical sibling with absence of iron overload.	10207799
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Rapid genetic screening for haemochromatosis using heteroduplex technology.	British journal of haematology	1997	5.4	The recently described association between haemochromatosis and mutations in the HFE or HLA-'H' gene has prompted the need for a simple and rapid genetic test capable of detecting multiple mutations simultaneously. Heteroduplex analysis, a new diagnostic technique, fulfills such criteria and we have investigated the potential for the detection of the Cys282Tyr mutation. 100 subjects were genotyped using the heteroduplex approach. The results showed clear distinction between individuals who did not carry the mutation, individuals who were heterozygous for the mutation and homozygous individuals. Heteroduplex results obtained by both silver staining and capillary electrophoresis showed 100% concordance with those obtained by restriction digestion of PCR product.	9326178
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Lower serum hepcidin and greater parenchymal iron in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease patients with C282Y HFE mutations.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2012	0.5	Hepcidin regulation is linked to both iron and inflammatory signals and may influence iron loading in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The aim of this study was to examine the relationships among HFE genotype, serum hepcidin level, hepatic iron deposition, and histology in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping for C282Y (rs1800562) and H63D (rs1799945) HFE mutations was performed in 786 adult subjects in the NASH Clinical Research Network (CRN). Clinical, histologic, and laboratory data were compared using nonparametric statistics and multivariate logistic regression. NAFLD patients with C282Y, but not H63D mutations, had lower median serum hepcidin levels (57 versus 65 ng/mL; P = 0.01) and higher mean hepatocellular (HC) iron grades (0.59 versus 0.28; P < 0.001), compared to wild-type (WT) subjects. Subjects with hepatic iron deposition had higher serum hepcidin levels than subjects without iron for all HFE genotypes (P < 0.0001). Hepcidin levels were highest among patients with mixed HC/reticuloendothelial system cell (RES) iron deposition. H63D mutations were associated with higher steatosis grades and NAFLD activity scores (odds ratio [OR], ≥1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI]: >1.0, ≤2.5; P ≤ 0.041), compared to WT, but not with either HC or RES iron. NAFLD patients with C282Y mutations had less ballooning or NASH (OR, ≤0.62; 95% CI: >0.39, <0.94; P ≤ 0.024), compared to WT subjects. The presence of C282Y mutations in patients with NAFLD is associated with greater HC iron deposition and decreased serum hepcidin levels, and there is a positive relationship between hepatic iron stores and serum hepcidin level across all HFE genotypes. These data suggest that body iron stores are the major determinant of hepcidin regulation in NAFLD, regardless of HFE genotype. A potential role for H63D mutations in NAFLD pathogenesis is possible through iron-independent mechanisms.	22611049
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Pathogenesis, Diagnosis and Treatment of Hemochromatosis.	Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)	2016	0.5	Hemochromatosis is a common cause of chronic liver disease and HFE genotyping allows decisive and non-invasive diagnosis. Molecular and clinical genetic studies have led to the identification of genes other than HFE in patients with inherited diseases associated with increased hepatic iron storage that can cause hemochromatosis, which adds complexity to a diagnostic approach to patients with suspected hemochromatosis. Despite major advances in genetics, hepatic iron quantification by non-invasive methods therefore remains the key to the diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Although associated with homozygosity for the C282Y polymorphism in the HFE gene in >80% of patients, hemochromatosis is a complex genetic disease with strong environmental disease modifiers. Testing for mutations in the non-HFE hemochromatosis genes transferrin receptor 2, hemojuvelin, HAMP and SLC40A1 is complex, costly and time-consuming. Demonstration of hepatic iron overload by liver biopsy or MRI is therefore required before such complex tests are carried out. The pathogenesis of chronic liver disease in hemochromatosis is mainly attributed to the redox potential of tissue iron, and only the more recent studies have focused on the toxic properties of circulating iron. Considering the fact that an increased saturation of transferrin and high iron in plasma are the hallmark of all hemochromatosis forms, an alternative view would be that toxic iron in the circulation is involved in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis. Recent studies have shown an increased concentration of redox-active iron in plasma in patients with increased transferrin saturation. This finding supports the hypothesis that tissue iron may be the 'smoking gun' of iron-induced organ damage. Taken together, caring for patients with suspected or established hemochromatosis still remains a challenge, where understanding the genetics, biochemistry and cell biology of hemochromatosis will aid better diagnosis and treatment of affected individuals.	27170390
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis in the era of genetic testing.	Digestive diseases and sciences	2012	2.52	Homozygous C282Y mutation in HFE gene is responsible for the majority of hereditary hemochromatosis cases. Since 1996 this mutation can be identified by a simple genetic test. To determine the clinical presentations in patients with homozygous HFE C282Y mutation and the impact of genetic testing on the time needed for diagnosis. A total of 414 patients diagnosed with C282Y homozygous hereditary hemochromatosis before and after the introduction of genetic testing were evaluated regarding symptoms and clinical findings at diagnosis as well as first hemochromatosis-related clinical features in their past medical history. At the time of diagnosis, the predominant symptom was joint pain, in particular of the hands/wrists. Those patients presenting with hand/wrist arthralgia had significantly higher ferritin levels than patients without this joint involvement (p = 0.0005 for males and p < 0.0001 for females). After the introduction of the HFE genetic test an earlier diagnosis after first onset of hemochromatosis-associated clinical features was observed between 2006 and 2009 vs. 2000-2005 p = 0.01). Arthralgia, in particular of the hands/wrists, is a hallmark of hereditary hemochromatosis and its presence is associated with higher ferritin levels. Despite the availability of a genetic test, it often takes more than 6 years from the first onset of clinical features to diagnose hereditary hemochromatosis. This underlines the importance of raising the awareness of hemochromatosis and its typical clinical presentations.	22674401
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effect of the Hemochromatosis Mutations on Iron Overload among the Indian β Thalassemia Carriers.	Journal of clinical laboratory analysis	2016	1.55	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron metabolism characterized by increased iron absorption.HFE gene mutations C282Y and H63D are responsible for the majority of hereditary hemochromatosis cases. We tried to look at the effect of HFE mutations on the iron status. A total of 100 β thalassemia traits (BTT) with 100 normal individuals were screened for the C282Y and H63D mutations using PCR-RFLP. The serum ferritin levels were determined using ELISA kit. We did not find the C282Y mutation in our study group. The allelic frequencies for H63D mutation did not differ significantly between β-thalassemia traits (8.5%) and normal controls (9%). ΒΤΤ with H63D genotype of H/D (143.16 ± 80.3 ng/ml) and D/D (504 ng/ml) showed higher ferritin levels as against H/H genotype (88.64 ± 92.43 ng/ml). The statistically significant difference was observed in the mean serum ferritin levels among the individuals showing H/H and D/D genotypes (P < 0.002) and H/D and D/D genotype (P < 0.01) in both the groups. This suggests that iron load in BTT tends to aggravated with the co-inheritance of the H63D mutation. The mutant H63D gene showed the presence of haplotype 6 which is reported in the European population suggesting a common origin.	27561698
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Testing families with HFE-related hereditary haemochromatosis.	The Netherlands journal of medicine	2004	0.5	HFE-related hereditary haemochromatosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population. In 1996 the responsible gene (called HFE) was identified. Two mutations (C282Y and H63D) are considered most important and occur frequently in the Caucasian population. We describe a family of an affected proband in which first- and second-degree relatives were tested phenotypically and genotypically. In second-degree relatives both C282Y homozygosity as well as compound heterozygosity were found. Family testing can be useful to detect persons who will possibly develop iron overload. We must be aware that testing first-degree relatives only carries a 2.5% chance that persons at risk of developing iron loading will not be detected. Cascade screening of second-degree relatives might be cost-effective.	15366698
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Expression of the HFE hemochromatosis gene in a community-based population of elderly women.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2004	3.32	Recent studies suggest that the clinical penetrance of associated hereditary hemochromatosis, defined as either the C282Y homozygote or compound heterozygote HFE genotype status, is much lower than previously thought. We investigated the clinical penetrance and phenotypic expression of HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis in a community-based population of 1352 elderly female subjects with a mean age of 75 years. Serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels were determined on all subjects bearing a C282Y mutation and a subset of wild-type C282Y subjects. The prevalences of the C282Y homozygous and compound heterozygous HFE genotypes were 0.15% (2/1352) and 2.0% (27/1352), respectively. The observed prevalence of 0.15% for C282Y homozygotes borders on significance (P = 0.054) for deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg population equilibrium calculations, which predict a prevalence of 0.49%, whereas the observed and predicted compound heterozygote prevalences were not significantly different. Clinical symptoms of hemochromatosis were absent in both the C282Y homozygote subjects. Of the compound heterozygous subjects, 2/27 (7%) had elevated serum transferrin saturation and ferritin values; however, clinical symptoms of hemochromatosis were absent in both. Considered as a whole, the compound heterozygous subjects had markedly elevated means for serum iron (19.4 vs 16.0 micromol/L, P = 0.0008), transferrin saturation (34.8% vs 25.2%, P < 0.0001) and ferritin (157 vs 92 microg/L, P = 0.002) compared with the wild-type subjects. The C282Y homozygous HFE hereditary hemochromatosis genotype was under-represented in this elderly cohort, whereas the compound heterozygous genotype was not. None of the homozygous or compound heterozygous subjects expressed the phenotype of iron overload disease.	15377292
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic factors influence ethanol-induced uroporphyria in Hfe(-/-) mice.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2004	0.5	Two major risk factors for porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) are alcohol consumption and homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE). We recently described an animal model for alcohol-induced uroporphyria, using Hfe(-/-) mice. In the present study we show that this effect is dependent on genetic background and ethanol dose. In the 129S6/SvEvTac (129) strain, treatment with 15% ethanol in the drinking water for 6.5 months produced an accumulation of hepatic uroporphyrin (URO) 4-fold higher than that observed with 10% ethanol, a 90% decrease in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase activity (UROD), and further increased the activities of hepatic 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) and CYP1A2. Hepatic nonheme iron (NHFe) and hepatocyte iron staining were not further increased by 15% compared to 10% ethanol. Treatment of C57BL/6 Hfe(-/-) mice with 15% ethanol for 6.5 months did not increase hepatic URO. Although NHFe was increased by ethanol, the resulting level was only half that of ethanol-treated 129 Hfe(-/-) mice. ALAS induction was similar in both Hfe(-/-) strains. In wild-type 129 mice treated with ethanol for 6 to 7 months, administration of iron dextran increased hepatic URO accumulation and decreased UROD activity. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a strong effect of genetic background on ethanol-induced uroporphyria, which is probably due to a greater effect of ethanol on iron metabolism in the susceptible strain.	15382179
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Genotype and phenotypic expression of hereditary hemochromatosis in Spain].	Gastroenterologia y hepatologia	2004	0.8	The prevalence of C282Y homozygosity in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) has been reported to be markedly lower in the Mediterranean Basin than in northern Europe. In Spain, the available data are contradictory and limited to small series in specific regions. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of the 2 main HFE gene mutations in a large series of unrelated Spanish patients with HH from different geographical origins. The criteria for HH diagnosis were: repeat serum transferrin saturation index (> 45% plus C282Y homozygosity and/or hepatic iron index (> 1.9 of dry liver weight in non-cirrhotic patients or (> 4.1 in patients with liver cirrhosis. Cases in related individuals were excluded. Demographic data, clinical expression, iron parameters and HFE gene mutations (C282Y and H63D) were assessed in 222 patients. A total of 83.3% of patients were C282Y homozygous and 5% were compound heterozygous (C282Y/H63D). No significant differences in phenotypic expression or in the frequency of C282Y homozygosity were observed between patients born in the North and South of Spain. The genotypic and phenotypic expression of HH in Spain is very similar to that reported in Northern Europe. Thus, the genetic heterogeneity described in some Southern European regions cannot be considered a common feature to all countries of the Mediterranean Basin.	15388046
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in Asian Indians is neither associated with iron overload nor with HFE gene mutations.	World journal of gastroenterology	2005	2.79	The pathogenesis of occurrence of liver inflammation and fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is not completely understood. Other than insulin resistance, iron abnormalities have been thought to be one of the triggering factors. Therefore, our aim was to study the role of iron abnormalities and HFE gene mutations in patients with NASH. Thirty-one patients of NASH diagnosed on the basis of clinical examination biochemistry, ultrasonography and liver biopsy (n = 14) were included in the study. Serum iron parameters (n = 23) (iron, ferritin, total iron-binding capacity and transferrin saturation), Perls' iron staining on liver biopsies (n = 14) and HFE gene mutations (C282Y and H63D) (n = 16) were studied in these patients. The association between iron staining, necroinflammatory activity and fibrosis stage on liver biopsies was also determined. Elevated serum iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation above 55% were observed in 4.3% of patients. On histology, 71% of the patients had negative iron staining, 21.4% had 1+ staining, 7.2% had 2+ staining and none had 3+ or 4+ staining. There was no association between the degree of iron staining and necroinflammatory activity (P = 0.55) and fibrosis stage (P = 0.09) on histology. None of the patients had C282Y HFE gene mutation and four patients (25%) were found to be heterozygotes for H63D gene mutation. Our study does not favor iron overload and HFE gene mutations as major factors in the pathogenesis of NASH in Asian Indians.	15637751
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations C282Y, H63D and S65C in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.	European journal of heart failure	2005	5.13	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), a common autosomal recessive disease, leads to excessive iron accumulation in some organs, including the heart. It is therefore not surprising that cardiomyopathy is one of the most severe complications of HH. The HFE gene defects have been thought to contribute to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) in some patients, even though the results of genotype analyses have so far been contradictory. Hence we set out here to evaluate the prevalence and potential role of HFE mutations in patients with IDCM. A total of 91 IDCM patients and 102 controls were subjected to HFE mutation analyses, in which C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations were determined for each patient. We also analyzed the impact of the C282Y and H63D mutations on the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes. The prevalences of heterozygosity for the C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in the IDCM patients were 13.2%, 22.0% and 2.2%, respectively. LVEDD was significantly higher (P=0.037) in those with the C282Y mutation at the end of the follow-up period than in those with no mutation. Our data showed no significant deviations in C282Y, H63D and S65C mutation frequencies between the IDCM patients and controls, suggesting that these mutations do not increase the risk of IDCM. Heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation may nevertheless be a modifying factor contributing to LV dilatation and remodeling.	15642540
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The soluble transferrin receptor as a marker of iron homeostasis in normal subjects and in HFE-related hemochromatosis.	Haematologica	2005	6.67	The soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is a clinical marker of erythropoietic activity, also used in the diagnosis of iron deficiency. In the present paper we explore the meaning of this parameter in normal physiological conditions of iron homeostasis and in the setting of iron overload due to hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). Reference values for sTfR were established in a population of 42 apparently healthy subjects, analyzed in relation to other hematologic parameters, namely, hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), transferrin saturation (TfSat) and serum ferritin. The same analysis was done in a group of 45 patients with HH who were homozygous for the C282Y mutation of HFE and had a wide range of TfSat values. In addition, individual serial profiles were analyzed in three patients. In normal subjects circulating sTfR correlated significantly with the TfSat level, reflecting the systemic effect of iron availability on the erythropoietic activity in a normal physiological steady state. A TfSat of 25% appeared as a threshold value, below which there was a progressive increase in sTfR; this increase in sTfR occurred concomitantly with a decrease in Hb, MCV and serum ferritin. In HH patients the up-regulation of sTfR started at TfSat values as high as 50%. The fact that sTfR up-regulation started at higher TfSat values in HH patients suggests that the recognition of systemic iron available for erythropoiesis is altered in this condition. Based on these results, a new hypothesis is advanced, proposing that the HFE protein in involved as a sensor of systemic iron availability, via the soluble transferrin receptor.	15642666
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis: genetics and pathophysiology.	Annual review of medicine	2006	10.95	A number of genetic disorders can result in the accumulation of excess iron in the body. These causes of hereditary hemochromatosis include defects in genes encoding HFE, transferrin receptor 2, ferroportin, hepcidin, and hemojuvelin. Hepcidin, with its cognate receptor, ferroportin, has emerged as a central regulator of iron homeostasis; all of the known causes of hemochromatosis appear to prevent this system from functioning normally. The most common form of primary hemochromatosis is that caused by C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. This mutation is most prevalent among Northern Europeans. Although the frequency of the homozygous genotype is approximately 5 per 1000, the disease itself is quite rare because the clinical penetrance of the genotype is very low.	16409153
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations in viral-associated neoplasia: Linkage to cervical cancer.	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	2006	2.37	The present study examines the frequency of the two main HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) in a randomly selected population of 346 individuals including 201 DNA samples from women with cervical neoplasia (including high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and invasive squamous cell carcinoma) and a control population of 146 women from the same geographical area. We found a significantly lower risk of development of cervical neoplasia in H63D carriers (OR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.35-0.92; p = 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirms this observation (OR = 0.55; 95% CI 0.35-0.88, p = 0.01). Regarding the C282Y mutation no association was found (OR = 1.32; 95% CI 0.53-3.33; p = 0.52). In addition, a significant difference between H63D carrier and non-carrier women on the time-to-onset of cervical lesions was observed (log-rank test: p = 0.0012). These results indicate that HFE could be considered a candidate modifier gene of viral-related neoplasia such as cervical carcinoma possibly by a dual role on iron metabolism and immunological system.	16414021
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	S65C and other mutations in the haemochromatosis gene in the Czech population.	Folia biologica	2005	0.83	HFE-linked hereditary haemochromatosis is a common autosomal recessive disease among Caucasians. The primary pathogenetic mechanism is excessive absorption of iron, which is deposited in various organs with their subsequent damage. In 1996 the gene responsible for haemochromatosis was detected--the HFE gene and its major mutation C282Y. The discovery of further mutations followed. Two sites of point mutations in the HFE gene, C282Y and H63D, are associated with more than 80% of haemochromatosis cases. Another mutation-- S65C--was detected on 8% of chromosomes of haemochromatosis patients, which were negative for mutations C282Y or H63D. The objective of this study was to identify the allele frequency of S65C and other HFE mutations in the Czech population. DNA extracted from 481 randomly selected newborn screening cards (Guthrie cards) from all over the country was analysed by PCR-RFLP. No (0%) sample was identified as homozygous for S65C or C282Y mutation and 8 (1.67%) were homozygous for H63D mutation. Twelve (2.49%) samples were S65C heterozygous, 33 (6.86%) samples were C282Y heterozygous, and 128 (26.61%) were H63D heterozygous. Of these, 11 (2.29%) carried one copy of each mutation, i.e. were compound heterozygous. Two samples were S65C/H63D compound heterozygous and nine were C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous. Allele frequencies for S65C, C282Y, and H63D were 1.25% (95% CI, +/- 0.70), 3.43% (95% CI, +/- 1.15), and 14.97% (95% CI, +/- 2.25), respectively. The observed genotype frequency for S65C, C282Y, and H63D mutations in the Czech Republic agrees with those reported for other Central European populations.	16419611
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of HFE C282Y and H63D in Jewish populations and clinical implications of H63D homozygosity.	Clinical genetics	2006	3.89	The frequencies of C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene vary between different populations. A previous study showed an unexpectedly high H63D frequency in Chuetas (a population of Jewish descent). The present study addressed the question of the distribution of these mutations in Jewish populations from different origins and studied the possible causes of the high H63D frequency in Chuetas. Moreover, to improve the understanding of the controversial relationship between H63D homozygosity and iron overload, a group of patients with altered iron metabolism were studied. The high frequency of H63D mutation in Chuetas is not due to a high prevalence of this mutation in Sephardic Jews. Jewish populations have low C282Y and moderate H63D frequencies, suggesting slight gene flow from their surrounding populations. In accordance with historical and demographic data, genetic drift is the most probable cause for the singular H63D frequency in Chuetas. Clinically, this study of H63D homozygotes supports the conclusion that this genotype must be taken into account, because it confers an increased risk of iron overload and therefore genetic susceptibility to developing hereditary hemochromatosis or to aggravating other diseases.	16433696
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association of the transferrin receptor in human placenta with HFE, the protein defective in hereditary hemochromatosis.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	1997	9.42	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disease associated with loss of regulation of dietary iron absorption and excessive iron deposition in major organs of the body. Recently, a candidate gene for HH (also called HFE) was identified that encodes a novel MHC class I-like protein. Most patients with HH are homozygous for the same mutation in the HFE gene, resulting in a C282Y change in the HFE protein. Studies in cultured cells show that the C282Y mutation abrogates the binding of the recombinant HFE protein to beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) and disrupts its transport to the cell surface. The HFE protein was shown by immunohistochemistry to be expressed in certain epithelial cells throughout the human alimentary tract and to have a unique localization in the cryptal cells of small intestine, where signals to regulate iron absorption are received from the body. In the studies presented here, we demonstrate by immunohistochemistry that the HFE protein is expressed in human placenta in the apical plasma membrane of the syncytiotrophoblasts, where the transferrin-bound iron is normally transported to the fetus via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Western blot analyses show that the HFE protein is associated with beta2M in placental membranes. Unexpectedly, the transferrin receptor was also found to be associated with the HFE protein/beta2M complex. These studies place the normal HFE protein at the site of contact with the maternal circulation where its association with transferrin receptor raises the possibility that the HFE protein plays some role in determining maternal/fetal iron homeostasis. These findings also raise the question of whether mutations in the HFE gene can disrupt this association and thereby contribute to some forms of neonatal iron overload.	9371823
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hereditary haemochromatosis: recent developments in diagnostics].	Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde	1997	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HHC), a condition of abnormal iron absorption, is among the commonest diseases in humans. Early diagnosis is vital, because the disease is easily treated by phlebotomy to remove iron. Recently, mutations were identified in a HLA-class I-like gene, designated HFE and possibly associated with HHC. It was found that 83% of unselected HHC patients and more than 90% of patients with a clear family history of HHC, were homozygous for a single point mutation resulting in an amino acid substitution (Cysteine282Tyrosine) in the HFE protein. Although these data look compelling, they are not definitive proof that HFE is the haemochromatosis gene, but identification of these mutations will be of value in early diagnosis of haemochromatosis. However, the questions when to use the assay for detection of the Cys282Tyr mutation and how to interpret the results are not fully clear yet. Therefore, caution is still advocated when using molecular testing.	9380196
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Endothelial function, antioxidant status and vascular compliance in newly diagnosed HFE C282Y homozygotes.	Advances in medical sciences	2014	1.21	This pilot study was aimed to establish techniques for assessing and observing trends in endothelial function, antioxidant status and vascular compliance in newly diagnosed HFE haemochromatosis during the first year of venesection. Untreated newly diagnosed HFE haemochromatosis patients were tested for baseline liver function, iron indices, lipid profile, markers of endothelial function, anti-oxidant status and vascular compliance. Following baseline assessment, subjects attended at 6-weeks and at 3, 6, 9 and 12-months for follow-up studies. Ten patients were recruited (M=8, F=2, mean age=51 years). Venesection significantly increased high density lipoproteins at 12-months (1.25 mmol/L vs. 1.37 mmol/L, p=0.01). However, venesection did not significantly affect lipid hydroperoxides, intracellular and vascular cell adhesion molecules or high sensitivity C-reactive protein (0.57 μmol/L vs. 0.51 μmol/L, p=0.45, 427.4 ng/ml vs. 307.22 ng/ml, p=0.54, 517.70 ng/ml vs. 377.50 ng/ml, p=0.51 and 290.75 μg/dL vs. 224.26 μg/dL, p=0.25). There was also no significant effect of venesection on anti-oxidant status or pulse wave velocity (9.65 m/s vs. 8.74 m/s, p=0.34). Venesection significantly reduced high density lipoproteins but was not associated with significant changes in endothelial function, anti-oxidant status or vascular compliance. Larger studies using this established methodology are required to clarify this relationship further.	24797970
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepatic iron overload and hepatocellular carcinoma.	Liver cancer	2014	0.5	In recent years it has become increasingly evident that excess body iron may be complicated by the supervention of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) was the first condition in which hepatic iron overload was shown to predispose to the development of HCC. The inherited predisposition to excessive absorption of dietary iron in HH is almost always the result of homozygosity of the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, which causes inappropriately low secretion of hepcidin. HCC develops in 8-10% of patients with HH and is responsible for approximately 45% of deaths in the HCC patients. Cirrhosis is almost always present when HCC is diagnosed. Dietary iron overload is a condition which occurs in rural-dwelling Black Africans in southern Africa as a result of the consumption, over time, of large volumes of alcohol home-brewed in iron containers and having, as a consequence, a high iron content. Iron loading of the liver results and may be complicated by malignant transformation of the liver (relative risk of approximately 10.0). Accompanying cirrhosis does occur but is less common than that in HH. The development of HCC as a consequence of increased dietary iron, and the fact that it may develop in the absence of cirrhosis, has been confirmed in an animal model. Drinking water with a high iron content might contribute to the high incidence of HCC in parts of Taiwan. The metabolic syndrome [obesity, insulin resistance type 2 (or diabetes mellitus type 2), non-alcoholic fatty liver or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis] has in recent years become a major public health problem in some resource-rich countries. A link between excess body iron and insulin resistance or the metabolic syndrome has become apparent. The metabolic syndrome may be complicated by the supervention of HCC, and recent evidence suggests that increased body iron may contribute to this complication.	24804175
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The role of hereditary hemochromatosis in aseptic loosening following primary total hip arthroplasty.	Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society	2005	2.81	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) results in increased iron absorption and subsequent deposition in tissue. This condition occurs predominantly in individuals of Northern European and Celtic origin with Ireland having one of the highest allele frequencies in the world. This study examines the hypothesis that homozygosity for either the C282Y or H63D mutations in the HFE gene may be associated with aseptic loosening following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Two groups of individuals were screened for the C282Y and H63D mutations associated with HH. Group 1 were individuals who had undergone primary hip arthroplasty and group 2 were individuals who had undergone revision hip arthroplasty for aseptic loosening. Exclusion criteria included rheumatoid or other inflammatory arthropathies and revision due to causes other than aseptic loosening. Significantly more patients in the revision THA group were homozygous for the C282Y genotype (P = 0.014). Aseptic loosening occurred earlier in these patients (P = 0.009), in particular in the patients who had clinical signs of hemochromatosis. No association was seen with the H63D mutation and revision THA. The incidence of HH in the group of primary THA patients was no higher than the background incidence. Patients who require primary THA and who are homozygous for the C282Y mutation have an increased risk of developing aseptic loosening, leading to revision THA. Moreover C282Y homozygosity appears to be associated with earlier aseptic loosening than in individuals without the C282Y mutation.	15885473
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	The role of cystathionine beta-synthase in homocysteine metabolism.	Antioxidants & redox signaling		7.09	Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) is the first enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, catalyzing the conversion of serine and homocysteine to cystathionine and water. The enzyme contains three functional domains. The middle domain contains the catalytic core, which is responsible for the pyridoxal phosphate-catalyzed reaction. The C-terminal domain contains a negative regulatory region that is responsible for allosteric activation of the enzyme by S-adenosylmethionine. The N-terminal domain contains heme, and this domain regulates the enzyme in response to redox conditions. Besides its canonical reaction, CBS can catalyze alternative reactions that produce hydrogen sulfide, a novel neuromodulator in the brain. Mutations in human CBS result in homocystinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defects in a variety of different organ systems. The most common CBS allele is 833T>C (I278T), which is associated with pyridoxine-responsive homocystinuria. A complementation system in S. cerevisiae has been developed for analysis of human CBS mutations. Using this system, it has been discovered that deletion of the C-terminal domain of CBS can suppress the functional defects of many patient-derived mutations. This finding suggests it may be possible to develop drugs that interact with the C-terminal domain of CBS to treat elevated homocysteine in humans.	15890029
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Molecular basis in hereditary haemochromatosis].	La Revue de medecine interne	2005	0.5	Recent discoveries in molecular mechanisms of iron metabolism have changed the classical view of hereditary iron overload conditions. We present natural mutations in newly discovered genes and related phenotypes observed in patients with different form of haemochromatosis. Most haemochromatosis patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Ferroportin, TFR2, hemojuvelin and hepcidin mutations also cause iron overload. Recent data support the hypothesis that haemochromatosis should no longer be considered a monogenic disease but rather an oligogenic disorder. Several results suggest that haemochromatosis could result from digenic inheritance of mutations in HFE and HAMP. Other modifier genes probably influence penetrance in C282Y homozygous patients. Such genes could enhance or reduce the phenotypic expression in various iron overload conditions.	15893030
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Investigation of genetic variants of genes of the hemochromatosis pathway and their role in breast cancer.	Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology	2005	3.62	Iron overload has been noticed as a feature of human breast cancer. Cellular iron uptake is regulated by the hemochromatosis and transferrin receptor system, mutations of which cause the iron storage disease hereditary hemochromatosis. To understand the role of hemochromatosis and transferrin receptor system mutations in breast cancer, we analyzed 19 sequence variations at HFE, TFR1, TFR2, and FPN1 and compared genotype frequencies between cases and controls in a German population. There were 688 breast cancer patients and 724 population-based and age-matched controls. For genotyping, we applied the Hemochromatosis Strip Assay and TaqMan allelic discrimination analyses. In addition to genotype frequencies, we established frequencies of compound genotypes. The frequencies of HFE at His63Asp, Ser65Cys, and Cys282Tyr, and of TFR1 at Ser142Gly minor alleles in this German population were 15.9%, 1.8%, 5.6%, and 46.0%, respectively. No rare variants at 15 more loci at HFE, TFR2, and FPN1 were observed in breast cancer patients. There were no significant differences of allele and genotype frequencies between cases and controls. Triple and quadruple compound genotypes at HFE_His63_Cys282-TFR1_Ser142Gly and HFE_His63_Ser65_Cys282-TFR1_Ser142Gly showed a nonsignificant increase in cases. Although limited by low numbers, an increased prevalence of the HFE Tyr282 minor allele was observed in breast cancer cases with a high number of affected lymph nodes (P = 0.032). Our data suggest that variants of the hemochromatosis-transferrin receptor system have no direct effect on the incidence of breast cancer in Germany. Possible effects on tumor progression and prognosis remain elusive.	15894659
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum iron parameters, HFE C282Y genotype, and cognitive performance in older adults: results from the FACIT study.	The journals of gerontology. Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences	2010	0.5	Although iron homeostasis is essential for brain functioning, the effects of iron levels on cognitive performance in older individuals have scarcely been investigated. In the present study, serum iron parameters and hemochromatosis (HFE) C282Y genotype were determined in 818 older individuals who participated in a 3-year randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial examining the effects of folic acid on carotid intima-media thickness. All participants had slightly elevated homocysteine levels and were vitamin B12 replete. Cognitive functioning was assessed at baseline and after 3 years by means of a neuropsychological test battery. At baseline, increased serum ferritin was associated with decreased sensorimotor speed, complex speed, and information-processing speed and increased serum iron was associated with decreased sensorimotor speed. Cognitive performance over 3 years was not associated with HFE C282Y genotype or iron parameters. In conclusion, serum iron parameters do not show a straightforward relationship with cognitive functioning, although elevated iron levels may decrease cognitive speed in older individuals susceptible to cognitive impairment.	20813792
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A phase 1/2, dose-escalation trial of deferasirox for the treatment of iron overload in HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2010	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is characterized by increased intestinal iron absorption that may result in iron overload. Although phlebotomy is widely practiced, it is poorly tolerated or contraindicated in patients with anemias, severe heart disease, or poor venous access, and compliance can vary. The once-daily, oral iron chelator, deferasirox (Exjade) may provide an alternative treatment option. Patients with HH carrying the HFE gene who were homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation, serum ferritin levels of 300-2000 ng/mL, transferrin saturation ≥ 45%, and no known history of cirrhosis were enrolled in this dose-escalation study to characterize the safety and efficacy of deferasirox, comprising a core and an extension phase (each 24 weeks). Forty-nine patients were enrolled and received starting deferasirox doses of 5 (n = 11), 10 (n = 15), or 15 (n = 23) mg/kg/day. Adverse events were generally dose-dependent, the most common being diarrhea, headache, and nausea (n = 18, n = 10, and n = 8 in the core and n = 1, n = 1, and n = 0 in the extension, respectively). More patients in the 15 mg/kg/day than in the 5 or 10 mg/kg/day cohorts experienced increases in alanine aminotransferase and serum creatinine levels during the 48-week treatment period; six patients had alanine aminotransferase > 3 × baseline and greater than the upper limit of normal range, and eight patients had serum creatinine > 33% above baseline and greater than upper limit of normal on two consecutive occasions. After receiving deferasirox for 48 weeks, median serum ferritin levels decreased by 63.5%, 74.8%, and 74.1% in the 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg/day cohorts, respectively. In all cohorts, median serum ferritin decreased to < 250 ng/mL. Deferasirox doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg/day can reduce iron burden in patients with HH. Based on the safety and efficacy results, starting deferasirox at 10 mg/kg/day appears to be most appropriate for further study in this patient population.	20814896
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Transferrin and HFE genes interact in Alzheimer's disease risk: the Epistasis Project.	Neurobiology of aging	2012	5.15	Iron overload may contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the Epistasis Project, with 1757 cases of AD and 6295 controls, we studied 4 variants in 2 genes of iron metabolism: hemochromatosis (HFE) C282Y and H63D, and transferrin (TF) C2 and -2G/A. We replicated the reported interaction between HFE 282Y and TF C2 in the risk of AD: synergy factor, 1.75 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.8, p = 0.02) in Northern Europeans. The synergy factor was 3.1 (1.4-6.9; 0.007) in subjects with the APOEε4 allele. We found another interaction, between HFE 63HH and TF -2AA, markedly modified by age. Both interactions were found mainly or only in Northern Europeans. The interaction between HFE 282Y and TF C2 has now been replicated twice, in altogether 2313 cases of AD and 7065 controls, and has also been associated with increased iron load. We therefore suggest that iron overload may be a causative factor in the development of AD. Treatment for iron overload might thus be protective in some cases.	20817350
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis of a young girl: detection of early iron deposition in liver cell lysosomes using transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy.	Ultrastructural pathology		0.83	A 14-year-old girl demonstrated increased iron concentration and transferrin saturation, suggesting iron overload of unknown origin. Liver biopsy showed no fibrosis or hepatocytic atrophia. Nevertheless, Prussian blue reaction for histochemical detection of iron demonstrated very weak positive granules in a few hepatocytes on the periphery of hepatic lobules in close connection to bile capillaries. This very early stage of hemochromatosis was confirmed by TEM and EELS for iron accumulation inside hepatocytic lysosomes and residual bodies. Such siderosomes were scarce in number and iron content, compared to a case of manifested hemochromatosis and liver cirrhosis (Jonas L, Fulda G, Salemeh T, et al. Ultrastruct Pathol. 2001; 25: 111-118.). Liver iron concentration as measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) yielded 2.005 mg/g tissue dry weight, which was considered not significantly increased. In the absence of known causes for secondary iron overload, the early diagnosis was evidenced by genotyping, revealed homozygosity for the HFE gene C282Y mutation, demonstrating the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis.	12028655
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	No influence of hemochromatosis-related gene mutations on restenosis rate in a retrospective study of 137 patients after coronary stent implantation.	International journal of cardiovascular interventions	2001	0.5	BACKGROUND: Recent publications have shown an increased risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction in patients with alteration of the hemochromatosis-related gene (HFE gene). The HFE gene mutation is associated with elevated iron uptake and serum iron overloading. Iron plays an important role in promoting the oxidation of LDL cholesterol. The iron deposition in the endothelium and in the media is closely associated with the progression of atherosclerosis. However, it is unclear whether the mutation of the HFE gene also influences the rate of restenosis after coronary stent implantation. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, 137 patients (pts.) who underwent elective coronary stent implantation were angiographically reevaluated after six months. All patients were part of the OPTICUS-study population which investigated optimized stent implantation guided by intravascular ultrasound. Computerized quantitative analysis was performed in all procedures in a double-blinded fashion. At six-month follow-up, DNA fragments containing the substitution of tyrosine for cytosine at codon 282 were amplified by PCR. The results were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Statistical analysis was performed by multivariate linear regression. RESULTS: According to the HFE gene polymorphism we formed two subgroups: 129 pts. (94%) did not show changes in HFE gene (NH), 8 pts. (6%) were heterozygous for HFE Cys282Tyr (H). The groups did not differ in age, gender, extent of coronary artery disease, initial degree and length of stenosis and all patients underwent re-angiography. At six-month follow-up the average luminal narrowing in the stented vessel was 36.2 +/- 20.3% in the NH group compared with 27.8 +/- 20.0% in the H group which was statistically not significant (n. s.). The minimal luminal diameter was 1.9 +/- 0.71 mm in the NH group and 2.2 +/- 0.66 mm in the H group respectively (n. s.). 33 pts (26%) in the NH group versus 2 pts (25%) in the H group had >/= 50% diameter narrowing at follow-up (n. s.). The odds ratio of stent restenosis in H patients was 0.932. CONCLUSIONS: The authors did not find any association between restenosis rate and HFE gene alteration and therefore, we conclude that the polymorphism of the HFE gene is not a risk factor for restenosis after coronary stent implantation.	12036461
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Survival after liver transplantation in patients with hepatic iron overload: the national hemochromatosis transplant registry.	Gastroenterology	2005	18.19	Previous uncontrolled studies have suggested that patients with hepatic iron overload have a poor outcome after liver transplantation. We examined the effect of HFE mutations on posttransplantation survival in patients with hepatic iron overload. Two hundred sixty patients with end-stage liver disease and hepatic iron overload were enrolled from 12 liver transplantation centers. Hepatic iron concentration (HIC), hepatic iron index (HII), HFE mutation status, and survival after liver transplantation were recorded. HFE-associated hemochromatosis (HH) defined as homozygosity for the C282Y (n = 14, 7.2%) mutation or compound heterozygosity for the C282Y/H63D (n = 11, 5.6%) mutation was identified in 12.8% of patients. Survival postliver transplantation was significantly lower among patients with HH (1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of 64%, 48%, 34%, respectively) compared with simple heterozygotes (C282Y/wt or H63D/wt) or wild-type patients. Patients with HH had a hazard ratio for death of 2.6 (P = .002) after adjustment for age, United Network for Organ Sharing status, year of transplantation, and either elevated HII or HIC. Non-HH patients with hepatic iron overload also had significantly decreased survival when compared with the overall population undergoing liver transplantation (OR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.15-1.61, P < .001). One- and 5-year survivals after liver transplantation are significantly lower among patients with HFE-associated HH. Our data also suggest that hepatic iron overload may be associated with decreased survival after liver transplantation, even in patients without HH. Early diagnosis of hepatic iron overload using HFE gene testing and iron depletion prior to liver transplantation may improve posttransplantation survival, particularly among patients with HH.	16083706
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Intron 2 [IVS2, T-C +4] HFE gene mutation associated with S65C causes alternative RNA splicing and is responsible for iron overload.	Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology	2005	2.21	A patient with congenital liver fibrosis revealed a high transferrin saturation index and iron overload on liver biopsy. He did not carry the most frequent HFE mutations: C282Y or H63D. Heterozygosity was detected for S65C. Unknown HFE mutations were also sought using a combined denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC)/direct sequence approach and another point mutation, a transition T-C (nt 4910), at the fourth base of the donor splice site of intron 2 [HFE, intervening sequence (IVS) 2, T-C +4] was found. Family screening revealed that a daughter carried both S65C and [IVS2, T-C +4]. : The existence in our proband of a partly-altered HFE protein in the region encoded by exon 2 might be responsible for the histologically-demonstrated iron overload.	16099205
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis C282Y gene mutation increases the risk of venous leg ulceration.	Journal of vascular surgery	2005	3.45	Chronic venous disease (CVD) is the most common vascular disorder, progressing in approximately 10% of cases toward chronic venous leg ulceration, whereas the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) C282Y mutation is the most common recognized genetic defect in iron metabolism. Because CVD leads to local iron overload in the affected legs, we investigated whether two common HFE mutations could increase the risk of chronic venous leg ulceration. This was a case-control study at the Vascular Diseases Center, University of Ferrara, Italy. From a cohort of 980 consecutive patients affected by severe CVD (CEAP clinical classes C4 to C6) we selected 238 cases with the exclusion of any other comorbidity factor potentially involved in wound etiology (group A). They were subdivided into group B, including 137 patients with ulcer (classes C5 and C6: 98 primary and 39 postthrombotic cases), and group C, including 101 cases with no skin lesions (class C4). They were completely matched for sex, age, and geographic origin with 280 healthy controls (group D). A total of 518 subjects were polymerase chain reaction genotyped for HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D). We assessed the risk of ulceration by comparing the prevalence of ulcer in homogenous cases with and without the HFE variants. Other main outcome measures were the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the genetic test in CVD cases. C282Y mutation significantly increases the risk of ulcer in primary CVD by almost seven times (odds ratio, 6.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-30.8; P = .01). Application of the HFE test in primary CVD demonstrated increased specificity and positive predictive values (98% and 86%, respectively), with negligible sensitivity and negative predictive values. The overlap of primary CVD and the C282Y mutation consistently increases the risk of developing venous leg ulceration. These data, which have been confirmed in other clinical settings, suggest new strategies for preventing and treating primary CVD. The number of patients affected by primary CVD is so great that the vast majority of ulcers are also related to this common problem. On the other hand, there is not a reliable way for identifying in advance, from the broad base of primary CVD patients (20-40% of the general population), the high risk minority (10% of primary CVD cases) who will develop a venous ulcer. In such cases, a simple C282Y blood genetic test demonstrated an elevated specificity in predicting ulcer development (98%, CI 95%, 92.8-99.7). The genetic test could be applied starting from the C2 class, varicose veins, the most common situation observed in clinical practice. In perspective, the presence of the C282Y mutation would strengthen the indications and priorities for surgical correction of superficial venous insufficiency.	16102632
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effects of HFE gene mutations and alcohol on iron status, liver biochemistry and morbidity.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2005	3.32	The aims of the present study were to determine: (i) whether alcohol consumption is greater in individuals with HFE mutations; and (ii) whether common HFE mutations modify the effects of alcohol on serum iron and liver biochemistry or morbidity. The residents of the town of Busselton in Western Australia were subject to cross-sectional health surveys between 1966 and 1983. In 1994/1995 all surviving participants of the earlier surveys were invited to take part in a follow-up survey. Logistic, linear and Poisson log-linear regression analyses were performed in 1490 men and 1452 women from the 1994/1995 survey to assess the relationships between HFE mutations, alcohol, iron levels, liver biochemistry and morbidity. Heavy or moderate alcohol consumption was present in 7% or 36% of men and 0.5% or 12% of women, respectively. Alcohol consumption strongly influenced levels of serum ferritin and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and mean cell volume (MCV) in men and women but only alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in women. These effects were independent of HFE gene mutations. Hospital admission rates for respiratory disorders were higher in men with the C282Y mutation. Alcohol consumption strongly influences serum ferritin and GGT levels and MCV in men and women but only ALT levels in women, and these effects are independent of HFE mutations. HFE gene mutations do not predispose to moderate or heavy alcohol consumption. The C282Y mutation is associated with increased respiratory admission rates in men.	16105133
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Relationship of Baseline Hemoglobin Level with Serum Ferritin, Postphlebotomy Hemoglobin Changes, and Phlebotomy Requirements among HFE C282Y Homozygotes.	BioMed research international	2015	2.13	Objectives. We aimed to examine whether baseline hemoglobin levels in C282Y-homozygous patients are related to the degree of serum ferritin (SF) elevation and whether patients with different baseline hemoglobin have different phlebotomy requirements. Methods. A total of 196 patients (124 males and 72 females) who had undergone therapeutic phlebotomy and had SF and both pre- and posttreatment hemoglobin values were included in the study. Results. Bivariate correlation analysis suggested that baseline SF explains approximately 6 to 7% of the variation in baseline hemoglobin. The results also showed that males who had higher (≥150 g/L) baseline hemoglobin levels had a significantly greater reduction in their posttreatment hemoglobin despite requiring fewer phlebotomies to achieve iron depletion than those who had lower (<150 g/L) baseline hemoglobin, regardless of whether baseline SF was below or above 1000 µg/L. There were no significant differences between hemoglobin subgroups regarding baseline and treatment characteristics, except for transferrin saturation between male subgroups with SF above 1000 µg/L. Similar differences were observed when females with higher (≥138 g/L) baseline hemoglobin were compared with those with lower (<138 g/L) baseline hemoglobin. Conclusion. Dividing C282Y-homozygous patients into just two subgroups according to the degree of baseline SF elevation may obscure important subgroup variations.	26380265
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Relationships of serum free thyroxine and erythrocyte measures in euthyroid HFE C282Y homozygotes and control subjects: the HEIRS study.	International journal of laboratory hematology	2010	2.4	Hemoglobin (Hb) levels and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) are abnormal in some persons with hemochromatosis or thyroid disorders. We sought to determine whether serum free thyroxine (T4) affects erythrocyte measures in euthyroid adults with or without C282Y homozygosity. We evaluated 488 white HFE C282Y homozygotes and controls (no HFE C282Y or H63D; normal serum iron measures) identified in screening; we excluded those with thyroid disorders, anemia, erythrocytosis, or serum ferritin (SF) <34 pmol/l. In the remaining 141 C282Y homozygotes and 243 controls, we evaluated correlations of log(10) free T4 with Hb, RBC, MCV, and red blood cell distribution width (RDW). C282Y homozygotes had lower mean age, higher mean Hb, MCV, and log(10) SF, and lower mean RBC and RDW than controls; mean log(10) free T4 did not differ significantly. In HFE C282Y homozygotes, there was no significant correlation of log(10) T4 with erythrocyte measures. In controls, there was a positive correlation of log(10) T4 with Hb (P = 0.0096) and a negative correlation with RDW (P = 0.0286). Among euthyroid white adults without iron deficiency, there are significant correlations of log(10) free T4 with Hb and RDW in controls, but not in HFE C282Y homozygotes.	19706067
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Study on HFE gene mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and aplastic anemia].	Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi	2009	0.5	To detect the incidence of the HFE gene C282Y and H63D mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and aplastic anemia (AA), and analyze the relationship of these mutations with iron metabolism, and organs impairment from iron overload. The incidence of the C282Y and H63D mutations in 271 MDS, 402 AA patients and 1615 normal subjects was measured by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) combining with DNA sequencing. Iron metabolism parameters and iron overload indices were retrospectively compared between HFE gene mutation and unmutation groups in MDS and AA patients with no transfusion history. No C282Y and C282Y/H63D compound mutation was detected in all the three groups. The incidence of H63D heterozygous and homozygous genotype did not significantly differ between AA cases and controls (9.7% vs 10.2%, 0.25% vs 0.24% respectively, both P > 0.05). The frequency of H63D heterozygous genotype in MDS patients was significantly lower than that in controls (4.1% vs 10.2%, P = 0.002). H63D homozygous was not found in MDS patients. In both MDS and AA patients with no RBC transfusion history, serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation value (TS), serum iron concentration (SI) were close to or higher than normal; and unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) value was significantly lower. There was no significant difference in SF, SI, TS values between HFE-mutation and -unmutation MDS patients. For AA patients, only the level of SI was significantly higher in HFE-mutant group than in -unmutation group [42.6 (24.6-60.4) micromol/L vs 32.0 (8.4-63.3) micromol/L, P = 0.011]. There was no significant difference in the values of liver enzyme, fasting blood sugar (FBS), abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG), peripheral blood indices between HFE-mutation and -unmutation MDS and AA groups (all P > 0.05). The distribution of C282Y and H63D mutations has ethnic and genetic disparity, the frequency in Chinese population is lower than that in Caucasian. It seems that MDS and AA patients are susceptible to iron overload, in the diseases itself and the mutations of HFE gene are not the major factor for iron overload in the patients.	19731820
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene mutations and treatment of anemia in patients on hemodialysis.	Hemodialysis international. International Symposium on Home Hemodialysis	2009	0.5	Hemochromatosis causes iron overload by enhanced intestinal absorption. This study examined erythropoietin and intravenous (i.v.) iron requirements in hemodialysis (HD) patients with HFE mutations. Patients on HD for > 90 days with no cause of anemia except chronic kidney disease were tested for HFE mutations (H63D and C282Y). Intravenous iron and erythropoietin doses were adjusted to achieve recommended targets. Monthly hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin, mean corpuscular volume, mean cell hemoglobin, erythropoietin, and i.v. iron doses for 3 consecutive months were averaged. Of 172 patients, 71 (41.3%) had > or = 1 HFE mutation: 24 (14%) C282Y heterozygotes, 40 (23.3%) H63D heterozygotes, 5 compound heterozygotes, and 2 homozygotes. Comparing patients with > or = 1 HFE mutation to those without mutations showed no significant difference in Hb or serum ferritin. There was a trend toward lower median weekly erythropoietin dose in patients with > or = 1 HFE mutation (94.0 vs. 135.4 U/kg body weight; P=0.13). There was no difference in median weekly i.v. iron dose (1.0 vs. 0.9 mg/kg body weight; P=0.56). Comparing the 30 patients with a C282Y mutation to patients without HFE mutations produced similar results. Comparing the 47 patients with an H63D mutation, with those without HFE mutations, no discernable trend was observed. In this study, patients with HFE gene mutations on HD for established renal failure do not require less iron supplementation to achieve recommended Hb targets. We observed a trend toward lower erythropoietin requirement in patients possessing C282Y mutations. Larger studies may clarify the role of HFE mutations, regulators of iron metabolism and erythropoiesis in chronic kidney disease.	19732172
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	White blood cells and subtypes in HFE p.C282Y and wild-type homozygotes in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2016	0.5	The major histocompatibility complex is linked to white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts in subjects unselected for HFE genotypes. We compared age, sex, body mass index, total WBC and subtypes (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils) (Beckman Coulter® Gen-S), transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin of HFE p.C282Y and wild-type (p.C282Y, p.H63D negative) homozygotes without acquired conditions that influence WBC counts. We performed regressions on WBC and subtypes. There were 161 p.C282Y homozygotes (45.3% men) and 221 wild-type homozygotes (40.3% men). Mean WBC of men and women and between HFE genotypes were similar. Mean lymphocytes were higher in male p.C282Y homozygotes: 1.6×10 9 /L [95% confidence interval: 1.5,1.7] vs. 1.4 [1.3,1.5], p=0.0002. Mean lymphocytes and basophils were higher in female p.C282Y homozygotes: 1.6 [1.5,1.7] vs. 1.4 [1.3,1.5], p=0.0002; and 0.065 [0.059,0.071] vs. 0.052 [0.051,0.054], p=0.0001, respectively. Transferrin saturation was associated with neutrophils (negative; p=0.0163). Age was associated with lymphocytes (negative; p=0.0003) and monocytes (positive; p<0.0001). Regressions on lymphocytes and basophils revealed positive associations with p.C282Y homozygosity (p=0.0043 and 0.0003, respectively). There were significant positive associations of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. We conclude that HFE p.C282Y homozygosity is significantly associated with lymphocyte and basophil counts.	27915113
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Underdiagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis: lack of presentation or penetration?	Gut	2002	14.92	The majority of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. We have demonstrated a homozygote frequency of 1 in 83 for the C282Y mutation in a retrospective analysis of Irish neonates. However, a fully developed phenotype is not observed at the same frequency clinically, suggesting that a large proportion of Irish HH patients may remain undiagnosed. To determine whether underdiagnosis of HH results from the non-specific nature of early symptoms or incomplete penetrance of the C282Y mutation. Seventy nine C282Y homozygous individuals identified from family screening for HH and 30 HH probands were investigated. Non-specific symptoms (fatigue, arthropathy, and impotence) and their association with iron indices (transferrin saturation and serum ferritin) and hepatic iron deposition were analysed. We found that 78% of men (mean age 42 years) and 36% of women (mean age 39 years) who were identified as C282Y homozygotes following family screening had iron overload, as defined by a transferrin saturation >or=52% combined with a serum ferritin >or=300 microg/l for men and >or=200 microg/l for women. The frequency of reports of non-specific symptoms in those individuals with iron overload was not significantly different from those who did not have iron overload. Our findings indicate that underdiagnosis of HH may be due to the non-specific nature of early symptoms and less frequently to the incomplete penetrance of the C282Y mutation.	12077102
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations, hepatic iron, and fibrosis: ethnic-specific association of NASH with C282Y but not with fibrotic severity.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2002	0.5	There is conflicting evidence regarding inheritance of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations and influence of hepatic iron deposition as cofactors for development of fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We studied hepatic iron content (Perls' stain grade), frequency of HFE mutations, and serum iron indices in 93 patients with NASH from a multiethnic background; 59 (63%) were of Anglo-Celtic origin. Data on C282Y mutations were available for all 93 patients and on H63D for 69 patients. Respective controls were 206 (for C282Y, 141 [69%] of whom were Anglo-Celtic) and 180 (for H63D) blood donors. Hyperferritinemia was present in 38 patients (40%) with NASH, but transferrin saturation was increased (>55%) in only 5 (5%). Liver biopsy specimens showed advanced fibrosis in 31 (33%) (cirrhosis in 20%). Altogether, 9 biopsy specimens (10%) showed increased iron: 7 (8%) with grade 2 and 2 (2%) with grade 3 iron staining. Only 1 biopsy specimen with increased iron showed advanced fibrosis. The frequency of C282Y heterozygosity was increased in Anglo-Celtic patients with NASH compared with ethnic blood donor controls (22% vs. 9.2%; P =.035); there were no C282Y homozygotes in the NASH cohort. Although there was a trend toward higher serum ferritin levels among C282Y heterozygotes with NASH, there were no differences in histologic grades of steatosis, inflammation, or fibrosis between individuals with and without C282Y. The frequencies of compound C282Y/H63D heterozygotes (n = 1) or H63D heterozygotes (n = 10) were not increased in NASH. Multivariate analysis identified female sex, diabetes mellitus, and more severe liver inflammation but not HFE mutations, serum ferritin, iron saturation, or hepatic iron staining as independent predictors of hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, hepatic iron is not a factor linked to hepatic fibrogenesis in patients with NASH. HFE mutations do not confer an additional risk of hepatic fibrosis in this disorder.	12085358
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Autosomal dominant reticuloendothelial iron overload associated with a 3-base pair deletion in the ferroportin 1 gene (SLC11A3).	Blood	2002	11.84	We describe a family with autosomal dominant inheritance of increased body iron stores characterized by raised serum ferritin concentration and normal transferrin saturation. Liver biopsy showed iron deposition in Kupffer cells without fibrosis. The clinical features of HFE-related hemochromatosis were absent, as were the Cys282Tyr and His63Asp mutations. Venesection therapy was poorly tolerated, suggesting a defect in iron release from reticuloendothelial stores. A 3-base pair deletion in exon 5 of the ferroportin 1 gene (SLC11A3) predicting Val162 deletion was found in affected members, but not in unaffected individuals or in 100 control subjects. Consensus structural predictions of the transmembrane helices showed that the deletion is in the extracellular loop between the third and fourth predicted transmembrane helices and lies within a spatial cluster of other known ferroportin 1 mutations. These results indicate that this extracellular cluster is functionally important for iron transport, and its disruption leads to iron overload.	12091367
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The Cys282Tyr polymorphism in the HFE gene in Australian Parkinson's disease patients.	Neuroscience letters	2002	2.11	Iron homeostasis is altered in Parkinson's disease (PD). The HFE protein is an important regulator of cellular iron homeostasis and variations within this gene can result in iron overload and the disorder known as hereditary haemochromatosis. We studied the Cys282Tyr single nucleotide polymorphism as a genetic risk factor for PD in two distinct and separately collected cohorts of Australian PD patients and controls. In the combined cohort comprising 438 PD patients and 485 control subjects, we revealed an odds ratio for possession of the 282Tyr allele of 0.61 (95% confidence interval, CI=0.42-0.90, P=0.011) from univariate chi-squared and 0.59 (95% CI=0.39-0.90, P=0.014) after logistic regression analyses (correcting for potential confounding factors). These results suggest that possession of the 282Tyr allele may offer some protection against the development of PD.	12098643
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Raised serum ferritin predicts non-response to interferon and ribavirin treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection.	Liver	2002	0.5	Previous studies have indicated that response to interferon therapy is inversely proportional to the amount of body iron stores. We have studied the relationship between serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, liver iron, presence of HFE-C282Y gene mutation and response to treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. Two hundred and fifty-six naive, HCV-RNA positive patients (60% males, median age 38 years, range 21-70) were treated with interferon and ribavirin for 6 months. Iron indices and the presence of the C282Y mutation were measured. In 242 (94%) patients iron deposition were determined by Perls staining method. Patients with negative HCV-RNA at 6 months after the end of treatment were defined as sustained viral responders. Non-responders (n = 127) had significantly higher median s-ferritin values compared with sustained viral responders (130 microg/L vs. 75 microg/L P < 0.001). There was no difference in transferrin saturation among the two response groups. Only 23% (4/7) of patients with Perls grade 1 in liver biopsies responded to treatment vs. 54% (122/225) patients without iron deposition (P = 0.02), however, 10/13-non-responders had HCV genotype one. Two patients (0.8%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, 36 patients were heterozygous (14%). Among mutation carriers 26/38 achieved sustained response compared with 102/216 non-carriers (68% vs. 48%, P = 0.02). In a multivariate analysis s-ferritin (P = 0.030) and C282Y carrier status (P = 0.012) remained independent predict of sustained response. Raised s-ferritin values predicate non-response to interferon-ribavirin therapy in hepatitis C patients. Response rate in C282Y mutation carriers seems greater than in non-carriers.	12100578
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Correction of cystathionine β-synthase deficiency in mice by treatment with proteasome inhibitors.	Human mutation	2013	5.09	Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an inborn error of metabolism characterized by extremely elevated levels of plasma total homocysteine. The vast majority of CBS-deficient patients have missense mutations located in the CBS gene that result in the production of either misfolded or unstable protein. Here, we examine the effect of proteasome inhibitors on mutant CBS function using two different mouse models of CBS deficiency. These mice lack mouse CBS and express a missense mutant human CBS enzyme (either p.I278T or p.S466L) that has less than 5% of normal liver CBS activity, resulting in a 10-30-fold elevation in plasma homocysteine levels. We show that treatment of these mice with two different proteasome inhibitors can induce liver Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp27, increase levels of active CBS, and lower plasma homocysteine levels to within the normal range. However, response rates varied, with 100% (8/8) of the p.S466L animals showing correction, but only 38% (10/26) of the p.I278T animals. In total, our data show that treatment with proteostasis modulators can restore significant enzymatic activity to mutant misfolded CBS enzymes and suggests that they may be useful in treating certain types of genetic diseases caused by missense mutations.	23592311
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical cofactors and hepatic fibrosis in hereditary hemochromatosis: the role of diabetes mellitus.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2012	0.5	The risk of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in hereditary hemochromatosis relates to the degree of iron loading, but iron alone does not explain the variability in disease penetrance. This study sought to identify clinical cofactors that increase the risk of progressive liver disease. We identified 291 patients from our database who were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE and had undergone a liver biopsy with quantification of hepatic iron concentration (HIC) and fibrosis staging. Data were collected from a retrospective chart review, including age, gender, alcohol consumption, medical therapy, smoking history, metabolic risk factors, mobilizable iron, and laboratory results. Male gender, excess alcohol consumption, HIC, and the presence of diabetes were independently associated with increasing fibrosis stage in multivariate analysis. Of these, the presence of diabetes showed the strongest association (odds ratio, 7.32; P = 0.03). The presence of steatosis was associated with higher fibrosis scores, but this was of borderline statistical significance. Risk factors for hepatic steatosis were male gender, impaired glucose tolerance, and increased body mass index. The presence of diabetes was associated with more severe hepatic fibrosis independent of iron loading, male gender, and alcohol consumption. The mechanism for this association is unknown and deserves further evaluation; however, it is possible that diabetes produces an additional hepatic oxidative injury from hyperglycemia. Thus, management of such cofactors in patients with hemochromatosis is important to reduce the risk of liver injury and fibrosis.	22422567
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Study of the HFE gene common polymorphisms in French patients with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.	Journal of the neurological sciences	2012	2.13	Our objective was to investigate whether the C282Y (p.Cys 282 Tyr) and H63D (p. His 63 Asp) HFE polymorphisms were associated with sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SALS) in the French population. We searched for a relation of HFE polymorphisms with the clinical characteristics of the disease. The HFE polymorphisms were studied in 824 patients with SALS and 583 controls. We compared the frequency of the polymorphisms between SALS and controls groups by univariate and multivariate statistics, taking into account gender, site, age-at-onset and survival. We did not observe significant difference in the frequency of H63D polymorphism between SALS and control group. We observed a significant difference for C282Y between patients and controls with a low frequency of the Y allele in patients (3.2%) compared to our control group (5.9%). Disease duration, distribution of gender, site-of-onset, age-at-onset did not differ between groups taking into account genotypes of each polymorphism. Our results in this large cohort of ALS patients indicate that H63D polymorphism is not associated with SALS in the French population. This conclusion does not exclude a weak effect of the HFE gene polymorphisms in certain ALS populations, or an effect of other rare HFE gene variants.	22425014
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis mutations and ferritin in myocardial infarction: a case-control study.	European journal of clinical investigation	2002	2.69	Iron accumulation may contribute to coronary heart disease by catalysing free radical formation and promoting oxidation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Epidemiological studies of iron status and coronary heart disease are conflicting. To test whether genetic haemochromatosis is associated with myocardial infarction, we determined the prevalence of three mutations in the HFE gene (Cys282Tyr, His63Asp and Ser65Cys) in a 2 : 1 case-control study including 177 patients who survived an acute myocardial infarction and 89 controls. Genotypes were determined by PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by restriction enzyme digestion. We also studied the relationship between plasma ferritin and myocardial infarction. The carrier frequencies of these three mutations were not statistically different among patients and controls (Cys282Tyr: 1.4 vs. 10.1%; His63Asp: 26.5 vs. 31.5%; Ser65Cys: 2.8 vs. 1.1%). Mean ferritin levels were elevated among patients (176 +/- 155 microg L(-1)) compared with controls (131 +/- 106 microg L(-1), P = 0.015). Subjects with plasma ferritin concentrations of 300 microg L(-1) or more had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.2-7.3, P = 0.02) unadjusted risk for a myocardial infarction compared with those with normal levels. In a univariate analysis, ferritin was significantly associated with myocardial infarction. Upon multiple regression analysis adjusting for smoking, hypertension, diabetes, body-mass index and total cholesterol, significance was no longer present. No direct association was found between genetic haemochromatosis and myocardial infarction among Swiss whites. Raised ferritin levels among patients suggest a role of increased iron stores in myocardial infarction, but iron overload was not an independent risk factor for Swiss coronary heart disease patients.	11886425
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations in an inflammatory arthritis population.	Rheumatology (Oxford, England)	2002	0.5	To determine the value of screening patients with inflammatory arthritis for haemochromatosis-associated mutations in the HFE gene. We screened 1000 patients with inflammatory arthritis and 1000 controls for the HFE gene mutations that are associated with haemochromatosis. The arthritis patients were diagnosed between 1989 and 1995 and their blood DNA was archived as part of the Norfolk Arthritis Register project. Five out of 1000 (0.005) patients in the arthritis group were homozygous for the HFE C282Y mutation. This frequency is the same as the frequency of 5/1000 (0.005) for C282Y homozygosity observed in the normal population. It is slightly above the predicted frequency of homozygosity of 0.0044 derived from the gene frequency in the normal population. These data suggest that most of the C282Y homozygotes occurred in this arthritis group by chance and that their arthritis was incidental to their HFE genotype. This implies that screening for HFE mutations among patients with inflammatory arthritis would infrequently identify patients whose arthritis might benefit from additional treatment.	11886966
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of HLA-A antigens and C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene in Brazilian patients with hemochromatosis.	Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas	2002	0.5	The hemochromatosis gene, HFE, is located on chromosome 6 in close proximity to the HLA-A locus. Most Caucasian patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) are homozygous for HLA-A3 and for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, while a minority are compound heterozygotes for C282Y and H63D. The prevalence of these mutations in non-Caucasian patients with HH is lower than expected. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the frequencies of HLA-A antigens and the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene in Brazilian patients with HH and to compare clinical and laboratory profiles of C282Y-positive and -negative patients with HH. The frequencies of HLA-A and C282Y and H63D mutations were determined by PCR-based methods in 15 male patients (median age 44 (20-72) years) with HH. Eight patients (53%) were homozygous and one (7%) was heterozygous for the C282Y mutation. None had compound heterozygosity for C282Y and H63D mutations. All but three C282Y homozygotes were positive for HLA-A3 and three other patients without C282Y were shown to be either heterozygous (N = 2) or homozygous (N = 1) for HLA-A3. Patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation had higher ferritin levels and lower age at onset, but the difference was not significant. The presence of C282Y homozygosity in roughly half of the Brazilian patients with HH, together with the findings of HLA-A homozygosity in C282Y-negative subjects, suggest that other mutations in the HFE gene or in other genes involved in iron homeostasis might also be linked to HH in Brazil.	11887210
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Intestinal expression of genes involved in iron absorption in humans.	American journal of physiology. Gastrointestinal and liver physiology	2002	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is one of the most frequent genetic disorders in humans. In healthy individuals, absorption of iron in the intestine is tightly regulated by cells with the highest iron demand, in particular erythroid precursors. Cloning of intestinal iron transporter proteins provided new insight into mechanisms and regulation of intestinal iron absorption. The aim of this study was to assess whether, in humans, the two transporters are regulated in an iron-dependent manner and whether this regulation is disturbed in HHC. Using quantitative PCR, we measured mRNA expression of divalent cation transporter 1 (DCT1), iron-regulated gene 1 (IREG1), and hephaestin in duodenal biopsy samples of individuals with normal iron levels, iron-deficiency anemia, or iron overload. In controls, we found inverse relationships between the DCT1 splice form containing an iron-responsive element (IRE) and blood hemoglobin, serum transferrin saturation, or ferritin. Subjects with iron-deficiency anemia showed a significant increase in expression of the spliced form, DCT1(IRE) mRNA. Similarly, in subjects homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation, DCT1(IRE) expression levels remained high despite high serum iron saturation. Furthermore, a significantly increased IREG1 expression was observed. Hephaestin did not exhibit a similar iron-dependent regulation. Our data show that expression levels of human DCT1 mRNA, and to a lesser extent IREG1 mRNA, are regulated in an iron-dependent manner, whereas mRNA of hephaestin is not affected. The lack of appropriate downregulation of apical and basolateral iron transporters in duodenum likely leads to excessive iron absorption in persons with HHC.	11897618
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Recognition and management of hereditary hemochromatosis.	American family physician	2002	1.88	Hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common inherited single-gene disorder in people of northern European descent. It is characterized by increased intestinal absorption of iron, with deposition of the iron in multiple organs. Previously, the classic description was combined diabetes mellitus, cutaneous hyperpigmentation and cirrhosis. Increasingly, however, hereditary hemochromatosis is being diagnosed at an earlier, less symptomatic stage. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical, laboratory and pathologic findings, including elevated serum transferrin saturation. Life expectancy is usually normal if phlebotomy is initiated before the development of cirrhosis or diabetes mellitus. Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with mutations in the HFE gene. Between 60 and 93 percent of patients with the disorder are homozygous for a mutation designated C282Y. The HFE gene test is useful in confirming the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis, screening adult family members of patients with HFE mutations and resolving ambiguities concerning iron overload.	11898957
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Biochemical and genetic markers of iron status and the risk of coronary artery disease: an angiography-based study.	Clinical chemistry	2002	7.46	"""Iron may promote coronary atherosclerotic disease (CAD) by increasing lipid peroxidation. Studies on biochemical or genetic markers of body iron stores as risk factors for CAD have yielded conflicting results. We studied 849 individuals with a clear-cut definition of the CAD phenotype, i.e., with (CAD; n = 546) or without (CAD-free; n = 303) angiographically documented disease. We determined serum ferritin, as a biochemical estimate of iron stores, and the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, i.e., the main cause of hemochromatosis in Caucasians. The relationships of ferritin with serum markers of either inflammation [C-reactive protein (CRP)] or lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) were also investigated. Mean ferritin concentrations were slightly higher in CAD vs CAD-free individuals, but this difference disappeared after adjusting for sex and CRP. Ferritin was significantly correlated with CRP (Spearman's test, rho = 0.129; P <0.001). Heterozygotes for Cys282Tyr were 4.8% among the CAD group and 6.6% among the CAD-free group (P = 0.26). The prevalence of high concentrations of stored iron, defined as ferritin concentrations above the sex-specific upper quintiles of the control distribution, was also similar in the two groups. There was a higher prevalence of """"iron depletion"""" in CAD-free vs CAD females (20% vs 8.8%, respectively), but this difference disappeared after adjustment for age and other cardiovascular risk factors (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-2.08). No differences in iron markers were found in CAD patients with or without myocardial infarction. Our results do not support a role for biochemical or genetic markers of iron stores as predictors of the risk of CAD or its thrombotic complications."""	11901060
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A previously undescribed nonsense mutation of the HFE gene.	Clinical genetics	2002	3.89	A patient with clinically manifest hereditary hemochromatosis was found to be heterozygous for the c.845 A-->G (C282Y) mutation. As simple heterozygotes for this mutation do not develop the hemochromatosis phenotype, the coding region of the patient's HFE gene was sequenced and a previously undescribed nonsense mutation was identified at c.211 C-->T (R74X). The patient's brother who also had the hemochromatosis phenotype shared his HFE genotype. To determine how common such mutations might be, the coding and 5' region of the HFE genes of 11 subjects who had been found in a large population survey to be heterozygous for the C282Y mutation and had elevated ferritin levels were sequenced. No mutations were found. Sequencing of the HFE gene also revealed two polymorphisms that had not previously been noted, -467 C-->G and -970 T-->G. Neither of these mutations appear to cause an abnormality in iron metabolism.	11903354
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Distribution of HFE C282Y and H63D mutations in the Balearic Islands (NE Spain).	Clinical genetics	2002	3.89	The HFE gene contains two main missense mutations: C282Y and H63D. Individuals with these mutations carry a risk of developing hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). The common form of this disease is due to homozygosity for the C282Y mutation. Population studies have shown the variation of the prevalence of these mutations in different countries and ethnic groups. The purposes of this current study were to determine the prevalence of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the Balearic Islands and the genotypic characterization of patients diagnosed with HH, as well as those with iron overload and liver diseases. A total of 1330 Balearic chromosomes were analyzed. The results showed that the populations of the Balearic Islands were not homogeneous. No C282Y carriers were observed in a group of descendants of Majorcan Jews (Chuetas) and the frequency was very low in Minorca (1.2%) in comparison with the other islands of Majorca (4.7%) and Ibiza (6.5%). The carrier frequency of the H63D mutation was similar in the three islands and very high (43.1%) in the descendants of Majorcan Jews. The study of patients was carried out in 129 individuals. The homozygous C282Y genotype was the principal one involved in hereditary haemochromatosis (90%), whereas the other HH patients were C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous and H63D homozygous.	11903355
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Co-selection of the H63D mutation and the HLA-A29 allele: a new paradigm of linkage disequilibrium?	Immunogenetics	2002	2.3	The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) shows a remarkable conservation of particular HLA antigens and haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium in most human populations, suggesting the existence of a convergent evolution. A recent example of such conservation is the association of particular HLA haplotypes with the HFE mutations. With the objective of exploring the significance of that association, the present paper offers an analysis of the linkage disequilibrium between HLA alleles or haplotypes and the HFE mutations in a Portuguese population. Allele and haplotype associations between HLA and HFE mutations were first reviewed in a population of 43 hemochromatosis families. The results confirmed the linkage disequilibrium of the HLA haplotype HLA-A3-B7 and the HLA-A29 allele, respectively, with the HFE mutations C282Y and H63D. In order to extend the study of the linkage disequilibrium between H63D and the HLA-A29-containing haplotypes in a normal, random population, an additional sample of 398 haplotypes was analyzed. The results reveal significant linkage disequilibrium between the H63D mutation and all HLA-A29-containing haplotypes, favoring the hypothesis of a co-selection of H63D and the HLA-A29 allele itself. An insight into the biological significance of this association is given by the finding of significantly higher CD8(+) T-lymphocyte counts in subjects simultaneously carrying the H63D mutation and the HLA-A29 allele.	11904676
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE codon 63/282 (H63D/C282Y) dimorphism in German patients with genetic hemochromatosis.	Tissue antigens	1998	2.05	Genetic hemochromatosis (GH) is closely associated with genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6. Recently, a candidate gene for GH, with structural similarities to MHC class I genes, designated HLA-H and presently named HFE, has been cloned. The HFE gene is localized telomeric to the MHC and several reports have indicated that the HFE gene is mutated in GH patients. In the present study we have analyzed the relationship of HFE gene variants and disease manifestation in GH patients and family members. Fifty-seven patients with GH, 73 family members and 153 healthy blood donors were studied for the amino acid dimorphism at codon 63 (His63Asp=H63D) and codon 282 (Cys282Tyr= C282Y) of the HFE gene. The codon 63 and 282 dimorphism were defined by PCR amplification of genomic DNA samples and restriction enzyme digestion using RsaI/SnaBI for C282Y and BclI/MboI for H63D. Ferritin, transferrin serum levels and total iron-binding capacity were determined prior to therapeutic intervention. The Tyr-282 substitution occurred in 53 (93%) of patients compared with 8 (5.2%) of controls (OR=169, P<0.0001). Fifty-one (90%) patients were Tyr-282 homozygous. In contrast, the Asp-63 substitution was present in 5 (8.8%) of the patients compared with 34 (22%) of controls (OR=0.39, P=NS) with none of the patients being homozygous. In Tyr-282 homozygous GH patients serum ferritin levels, transferrin saturation, liver iron and liver iron index were elevated significantly compared to Tyr-282-negative patients, whereas no difference was observed between Tyr/Cys-282 heterozygous and Tyr-282-negative patients.	9550327
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The C282Y mutation in the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) and hepatitis C virus infection are independent cofactors for porphyria cutanea tarda in Australian patients.	Journal of hepatology	1998	10.59	Whether mutations in the putative haemochromatosis gene (HFE) and hepatitis C virus act independently to precipitate porphyria cutanea tarda is unknown. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between mutations in HFE, hepatitis C and porphyria cutanea tarda. The frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE were determined in 27 patients with porphyria cutanea tarda and compared with the reported control frequencies. In addition, the presence of hepatitis C virus infection was identified and related to the patients' HFE status. The C282Y mutation was found in 44.4% of patients compared with the control frequency of 12% (p<0.001). Three patients were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, two of whom did not meet current clinical diagnostic criteria for expressed haemochromatosis. The proportion of patients with the H63D mutation did not differ from the reported control frequency. The mean transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentration were similar in porphyria cutanea tarda patients who were homozygous normal and heterozygous for the C282Y mutation, but greater in both groups than previously reported in healthy controls. Seven (25.9%) patients were anti-HCV IgG positive. None of these patients carried the C282Y mutation. Porphyria cutanea tarda patients heterozygous for the C282Y mutation and patients with anti-HCV antibodies had elevated transferrin saturations and serum ferritin concentrations. The raised frequency of the C282Y mutation in porphyria cutanea tarda indicates that this mutation is likely to be a predisposing factor. However, abnormalities of iron indices also exist in porphyria cutanea tarda patients without mutations in HFE. Hepatitis C virus infection is likely to be another common precipitating factor for porphyria cutanea tarda which acts independently of the C282Y mutation.	9551677
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Heterogeneity of hemochromatosis in Italy.	Gastroenterology	1998	18.19	Patients with hemochromatosis show variable phenotype expression. We evaluated the frequency of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations and the contribution of HFE genotype, ancestral haplotype, ethnic background, and additional factors (alcohol intake, hepatitis viruses, and beta-thalassemia trait) to the severity of iron overload in a large series of Italian patients with a hemochromatosis phenotype. HFE genotype was studied in 188 patients. Phenotype evaluation was available in 153 men and 20 women and was based mainly on iron removed. HFE genotype was determined by a polymerase chain reaction restriction assay and ancestral haplotype through D6S265 and D6S105 microsatellite analysis. The frequency of C282Y homozygotes was 64%, with a decreasing gradient from north to south. C282Y homozygotes showed more severe iron overload than the other HFE genotypes. In the same group, ancestral haplotype was associated with a more severe phenotype. Additional factors may favor the development of a relatively mild hemochromatosis phenotype in patients nonhomozygous for the C282Y mutation. Hemochromatosis in Italy is a nonhomogenous disorder in which genetic and acquired factors are involved. In patients with a single or no HFE mutation, further studies will enable a differentiation between true genetic disorders and interactions between genetic and acquired factors.	9558289
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Expression of HLA-linked hemochromatosis in subjects homozygous or heterozygous for the C282Y mutation.	Gastroenterology	1998	18.19	In the absence of a genetic test, diagnostic criteria for hereditary hemochromatosis have been imprecise. The identification of the HFE gene and the C282Y mutation allow definition of expression of this disease and reassessment of diagnostic criteria. The aim of this study was to analyze the concordance between the genetic diagnosis and the previous clinical diagnosis in families with hemochromatosis. Three hundred subjects were tested for the C282Y mutation and were grouped as homozygous, heterozygous, or homozygous normal. All adults previously diagnosed as homozygous or heterozygous for HLA-linked hereditary hemochromatosis carried at least one C282Y mutation. Two adolescents, previously thought to be homozygous, had no C282Y mutation. Of 127 subjects homozygous for the mutation, 105 met criteria for diagnosis. Iron overload was not expressed in 6.7% of homozygous men and 32.7% of homozygous women. The iron indices in 8 of 171 subjects heterozygous for the C282Y mutation were within the range previously regarded as indicative of homozygosity. Seven of these 8 carried the H63D mutation. In Australia, 17.3% of subjects homozygous for the C282Y mutation do not express iron overload to meet current diagnostic criteria of hemochromatosis. In subjects heterozygous for the mutation, 4.8% have iron overload in the range previously diagnosed as homozygous. Nonexpression is common, particularly in women.	9558290
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Liver and iron metabolism--a comprehensive hypothesis for the pathogenesis of genetic hemochromatosis.	Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie	2007	1.36	It is hypothesized that a homozygous C282Y mutation of the HFE gene prohibits the assembly of the transferrin-receptor 1 (TFR1) with the divalent metal transporter (DMT1) as the main iron update complex in hepatocytes membrane. Thus, the cellular influx of transferrin-bound iron from the endosomal compartment into the cytasol is compromised. As a consequence, transferrin saturation increases while concomitantly a cytosolic iron deficiency state develops. This in turn triggers the suppression of hepcidin synthesis in hepatocytes. Its impaired release into the bloodstream, causes the increased intestinal iron absorption of hemochromatosis. Excessively absorbed iron cannot be used by the erythron as a surplus for hemoglobin synthesis and is therefore trapped in ferritin complexes of RES macrophages. The ferritin is thereafter released into the bloodstream and taken up by hepatocytes for final disposal. In the lysosomal compartment ferritin is degraded to hemosiderin. Here, the release of excessive iron molecules may induce cellular injury via free radicals. The phenotypic expression of genetic hemochromatosis may depend on the activity of the erythron to use transferrin-bound-iron for heme synthesis. Therefore, a high erythron requirement for iron can utilize excess iron and may represent the rationale of phlebotomy therapy in this disease.	17236123
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis (HFE) gene splice site mutation IVS5+1 G/A in North American Vietnamese with and without phenotypic evidence of iron overload.	Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine	2007	4.56	Homozygosity for a novel hemochromatosis (HFE) gene splice site mutation (IVS5+1 G/A) was previously reported in a 48-year-old Vietnamese man residing in Germany who had an elevated serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) and severe iron overload on liver biopsy. This mutation was not found in 222 controls of central European origin but has been found in Southeast Asians living in Vietnam without evidence of iron overload. Hemochromatosis and iron overload screening (HEIRS) Study is an ongoing, multiethnic, primary care-based study of 101,168 North American adults, including 12,772 Asians, a group that the HEIRS Study found has a significantly higher than expected prevalence of elevated serum TS and SF but very low prevalence of the common C282Y and H63D HFE alleles usually associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. It was hypothesized that the IVS5+1 G/A splice site mutation might explain some elevated biochemical iron measures in North American Asians. Overall, 200 Vietnamese subjects from the Los Angeles Field Center who had TS and SF values greater than the 75th percentile of all HEIRS Study participants after adjusting for covariates and 149 controls randomly selected to represent this Vietnamese population were genotyped. Among cases, 1 homozygous mutant and 7 heterozygotes were found; among controls, 1 homozygous mutant and 4 heterozygotes were found yielding an allele frequency of 2.32% for cases and 2.04% for controls (P>0.5). This finding suggests that the HFE IVS5+1 G/A splice site mutation is not the major explanation for unexpectedly high prevalence of TS and SF in North American Asians.	17240320
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic study of variation in normal mouse iron homeostasis reveals ceruloplasmin as an HFE-hemochromatosis modifier gene.	Gastroenterology	2007	18.19	Genetic hemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic disorders, with progressive tissue iron overload leading to severe clinical complications. In Northern European populations, genetic hemochromatosis is usually caused by homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE protein. However, penetrance of this mutation is incomplete, suggesting that other genetic and environmental factors contribute to its differential biologic or clinical expression. To identify genes modifying iron homeostasis, we screened the 27 recombinant congenic strains of the C3H/DiSnA-C57BL/10ScSnA/Dem series for tissue and serum iron indices and genotyped 18 microsatellite markers in (C3H/DiSnA x HcB-2) F2 hybrid mice. We identified 1 locus encompassing the Ceruloplasmin (Cp) gene with a strong linkage with liver iron, serum iron, and transferrin levels but not with spleen iron. Sequencing of Cp showed an R435X nonsense mutation in exon 7 in C3H/DiSnA mice. To evaluate whether Cp might act as a modifier gene of genetic hemochromatosis, we intercrossed C3H Hfe(-/-) and C3HDiSnA Cp(R435X/R435X) mice. As expected, we found that double-mutant mice deposited more iron in the liver than mice defective for either one or both genes. In contrast, Hfe(-/-) x Cp(R435/R435X) or Cp(R435X/R435X) x Hfe(+/-) showed 30% decrease in liver iron when compared with single mutant mice. This study highlights the existence of complex interactions between Cp and HFE and represents the first example of a modifier gene with a protective effect, in which heterozygosity reduces the iron load in the context of HFE deficiency.	17258727

Gene	2013	2.32	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated to infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become the fastest-rising cause of cancer-related deaths. Genetic variations may play an important role in the development of HCC in HCV patients. Ghrelin exerts anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic and hepatoprotective effects on chronically injured hepatic tissues. Ghrelin gene shows several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including -604G/A, Arg51Gln, and Leu72Met. Hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations namely C282Y and H63D may cause hepatic iron overload, thus increasing the risk of HCC in HCV patients. To investigate the association of progression of HCC with ghrelin and HFE gene polymorphisms in HCV Egyptian patients. Seventy-nine chronic HCV patients (thirty-nine developed HCC and forty did not), and forty healthy control subjects were included in the study. The polymorphisms were evaluated by PCR/RFLP analysis, and related protein levels were measured by either ELISA or colorimetric assays. The three tested SNPs on ghrelin gene were detected in the studied groups, only one SNP (Arg51Gln) showed significantly higher GA, AA genotypes and A allele frequencies in hepatitis C patients who developed HCC than in hepatitis C patients without HCC and controls. Of the two mutations studied on HFE gene only H63D heterozygous allele was detected, and its frequency did not statistically differ among studied groups. Our results suggest that A allele at position 346 of the ghrelin gene is associated with susceptibility to HCC in hepatitis C patients.	23845776
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations in patients with altered iron metabolism in Argentina.	Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)	2009	0.5	Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is an iron overload syndrome caused by increased duodenal iron absorption, which leads to excessive iron deposition in parenchymal cells of the liver and mayor organs, causing cirrhosis, diabetes, cardiac failure, endocrine complications and arthritis. There are 6 types of HH related to mutations in the genes that encode proteins of iron metabolism. HH Type I is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait of mutations in HFE gene. We investigate the prevalence of C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in 95 individuals (77 males, 18 females) bearing iron metabolism alterations to establish an early diagnosis of HH. Among this population, 58% carried mutations in the HFE gene (45 males, 10 females). H63D mutation was found in 32.6% of the subjects (29.5% in heterozygocity, 3.15% in homozygocity). S65C mutation was only detected in the heterozygous form (5.3% of the patients), 2 of them carried also H63D mutation. C282Y in heterozygocity was found in 15.8% of the individuals; but only 4.15% carried this mutation in homozygocity. Our findings are in agreement with the prevalence of the Mediterranean origin of most of our patients, where C282Y mutation is not as common as H63D mutation.	19656448
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The global burden of iron overload.	Hepatology international	2009	1.12	There have been major developments in the field of iron metabolism in the past decade following the identification of the HFE gene and the mutation responsible for the C282Y substitution in the HFE protein. While HFE-associated hemochromatosis occurs predominantly in people of northern European extraction, other less-common mutations can lead to the same clinical syndrome and these may occur in other populations in the Asian-Pacific region. The most common of these is the mutation that leads to changes in the ferroportin molecule, the protein responsible for the transport of iron across the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte and from macrophages. Recent research has unraveled the molecular processes of iron transport and regulation of how these are disturbed in hemochromatosis and other iron-loading disorders. At the same time, at least one new oral iron chelating agent has been developed that shows promise in the therapy of hemochromatosis as well as thalassemia and other secondary causes of iron overload. It is pertinent therefore to examine the developments in the global field of iron overload that have provided insights into the pathogenesis, disease penetrance, comorbid factors, and management.	19669241
WAS	c.995T>C	p.Val332Ala	X-linked thrombocytopenia in a female with a complex familial pattern of X-chromosome inactivation.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2013	0.5	The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, eczema and various degrees of immune deficiency caused by mutations in the WAS gene, which encodes the WASP protein, the expression of which is restricted to haematopoietic cells. Mild allelic variants are associated with X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT). Female carriers tend in general to be asymptomatic as a consequence of a positive selection of cells with an active normal X chromosome, which results in a non-random inactivation of the mutated gene in affected cell lineages. We report on six female members of the same family carrying the mutated WAS allele p.V332A, which is known to be associated with XLT. One of them had presented severe thrombocytopenia from birth. Western blotting showed the WASP protein in peripheral blood cells to be normal in size and expression, and scanning electron microscopy revealed a normal distribution of microvilli on T cells. X-chromosome inactivation-pattern analysis showed total inactivation of the non-mutated paternal X chromosome in the patient's peripheral blood cells. All the other female family members were healthy and presented varying X-chromosome inactivation patterns, ranging from random X chromosome inactivation to total X-chromosome inactivation of the mutated chromosome. Our results in these female carriers of p.V332A show that manifestation of the disease requires a total inactivation of the non-mutated X chromosome and allow us to confirm that clinical manifestations in female carriers are highly dependent not only on the mutation characteristics but also on the X-chromosome inactivation pattern of affected line.	23689198
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The iron reabsorption index: a new phenotypic and pathophysiological descriptor in HFE hemochromatosis.	European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	2013	2.09	The current phenotypic descriptors of high Fe gene hemochromatosis are hardly specific and time dependent in a context of highly variable expressivity. We hypothesized that the rate of iron removed during maintenance therapy and corresponding to the iron reabsorption index (IRI) could be patient specific and may then represent a new useful phenotypic marker. The present study aimed to describe IRI with respect to its phenotypic specificity and to its potential usefulness. We studied a cohort of 316 p.Cys282Tyr homozygous patients with stable low serum ferritin levels on maintenance therapy for at least 12 months. Characteristics at diagnosis, date and volume of phlebotomies, and parameters of iron metabolism throughout maintenance therapy were determined. IRI ranged from 1.3 to 6.1 mg/day (median: 2.44). It was lower in women (difference: 1.26 mg/day), mainly explained by physiological blood loss, weight, and alcohol consumption. IRI was correlated to iron burden and fibrosis stage at diagnosis, was stable over time (variation: 11.5%), and depended on serum ferritin level during therapy. Its independence from disease duration, its stability, its wide distribution, and its significant correlation with iron burden markers make IRI a valuable potential phenotypic indicator of the daily iron overabsorption in hemochromatosis. Moreover, IRI provides a conceptual frame for empiric adaptation of maintenance therapy.	23708276
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased incidence of HFE C282Y mutations in patients with iron overload and hepatocellular carcinoma developed in non-cirrhotic liver.	Journal of hepatology	2000	10.59	Histological and biochemical iron overload has been reported in non-tumoral liver of most patients presenting an hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developed in non-cirrhotic liver (NCL). The aim of our study was to investigate HFE mutations in patients with HCC in NCL. Thirty-five patients with HCC in NCL were included either retrospectively or prospectively. Clinical data, iron and viral status, and HFE gene mutations were compared between groups with (I+, n = 19) or without histological iron overload (I-, n = 16). Twenty per cent of patients were HBV or HCV positive. Fifty-four per cent had hepatocytic iron overload at histology. Mean hepatic iron concentration was 100.2 +/- 14.6 micromol/g in I+ versus 23.2 +/- 2.1 micromol/g in I- (p<0.001). Among the 19 I+ patients, eight mutations were found: two C282Y/C282Y, three C282Y/WT, two C282Y/H63D and one H63D/H63D. None of these mutations was found in the I- group. There was no significant difference concerning the H63D heterozygous mutation between I+ or I- patients. In patients with HCC in NCL, HBV and HCV markers are rare (20%), and mild iron overload is frequent (54%). In patients with HCC in NCL and iron overload, C282Y mutations are frequent (36.8% of cases) and significantly increased (p<0.009) compared to HCC in NCL without iron overload; these mutations are mostly heterozygous. H63D heterozygosity is not associated with liver iron overload. Because of the small size of the series, HFE C282Y mutation should be investigated on a larger scale in patients with HCC in NCL with iron overload in order to confirm this association.	10845668
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis.	Clinical and laboratory haematology	1998	0.5	Genetic haemochromatosis (GH) is the most common, autosomal recessive disorder in Northern Europe. The studies which led to the identification of the HFE gene are described. In the UK over 90% of patients with GH are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of this gene. This mutation is confined to populations of European origin. The significance of another mutation, H63D, in causing iron overload is less certain. Preliminary studies on the localization of the protein and the effects of the mutations are described. Genetic testing and the measurement of iron status now provide the means to allow for widespread testing for the prevention of iron overload and its consequences. However, questions remain about the clinical penetrance of GH.	9681215
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis: an inherited metal and toxicity syndrome.	Current opinion in genetics & development	1998	5.78	A newly-identified major histocompatibility Class I-like gene, HFE (originally HLA-H) located approximately 3.5 Mb telomeric to the Class I cluster on chromosome 6p 21.3 harbours mutations in haemochromatosis. Two of these, Cys282Tyr (C282Y) and His63Asp (H63D, a minor determinant) have diagnostic utility as approximately 90% of adults are homozygous or compound heterozygotes for these alleles. The pathophysiological role of HFE is unclear: it is expressed as a surface molecule on many cells and the C282Y mutation disrupts interactions with beta 2-microglobulin, thus preventing surface expression. Lately, there has been experimental evidence that HFE protein interacts with the transferrin-receptor, affecting receptor turnover or its affinity for ligand.	9691000
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Are common mutations of cystathionine beta-synthase involved in the aetiology of neural tube defects?	Clinical genetics	1997	3.89	Mildly elevated maternal plasma homocysteine (Hcy) levels (hyperhomocysteinemia) have recently been observed in some neural tube defect (NTD) pregnancies. Plasma levels of Hcy are governed by both genetic and nutritional factors and the aetiology of NTDs is also known to have both genetic and nutritional components. We therefore examined the frequency of relatively common mutations in the enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), which is one of the main enzymes that controls Hcy levels, in the NTD population. Neither the severely dysfunctional G307S CBS allele nor the recently reported 68 bp insertion/I278T CBS allele was observed at increased frequency in the cases relative to controls. We therefore conclude that loss of function CBS alleles do not account for a significant proportion of NTDs in Ireland.	9084933
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Beta-globin mutations are associated with parenchymal siderosis and fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.	Journal of hepatology	2010	10.59	Parenchymal liver siderosis is associated with increased fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to assess whether a panel of genetic variants previously reported to influence iron metabolism, including the C282Y/H63D HFE, the PiZ/PiS alpha1-antitrypsin, the IVS1-24 ferroportin polymorphisms, and the beta-thalassemia trait, may be able to predict the presence of parenchymal siderosis and of progressive fibrosis in NAFLD. We considered 274 Italian patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Genetic polymorphisms were searched for by sequence allele specific-polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis, whereas beta-trait was determined according to blood count and HbA(2) determination. Parenchymal iron deposition was predominantly observed in 32 (11.7%) patients. Heterozygosity for the C282Y (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.04-3.25), homozygosity for the H63D HFE (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.04-4) mutations, and the beta-thalassemia trait (OR 2.57 95% CI 1.49-4.47) were all predominantly associated with parenchymal siderosis, independently of age, sex, body mass index, alcohol intake, ferritin, and transferrin saturation. Sixty-three percent of patients with hepatocellular siderosis were positive for at least one of the aforementioned genetic variants. The beta-thalassemia trait had the highest positive and the lowest negative likelihood ratios for predominantly parenchymal iron accumulation (5.05 and 0.74, respectively), and was independently associated with moderate/severe fibrosis (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.26-5.19). In patients with NAFLD, predominant hepatocellular iron deposition is often related to genetic factors, among which beta-globin mutations play a major role, predisposing to parenchymal iron accumulation and to progressive liver fibrosis.	20739079
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic aspects of scurvy and the European famine of 1845-1848.	Nutrients	2013	3.76	The view of scurvy being exclusively a nutritional disorder needs to be updated. Genetic polymorphisms of HFE and haptoglobin (Hp) may explain the geographic variability of mortality caused by the European famine of the mid-19th century. In this period, potatoes had fallen victim to the potato blight and Ireland was more severely hit than continental Europe. Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder with mutations in the HFE gene, characterized by iron overload (with a reduced vitamin C stability) and with a predominance of affected men. The Irish have the world's highest frequency of the C282Y mutation and the particular iron metabolism of the Irish helps to understand the size of the catastrophe and the observed overrepresentation of male skeletons showing scurvy. Hp is a plasma α2-glycoprotein characterized by 3 common phenotypes (Hp 1-1, Hp 2-1 and Hp 2-2). When the antioxidant capacity of Hp is insufficient, its role is taken over by hemopexin and vitamin C. The relative number of scurvy victims corresponds with the Hp 2-2 frequency, which is associated with iron conservation and has an impact on vitamin C stability. As iron is more abundant in males, males are overrepresented in the group of skeletons showing scurvy signs.	24036531
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: the clinical significance of the S65C mutation.	Genetic testing	2002	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common genetic disease with iron overload in certain organs, especially the liver. Most cases are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene; a few are C282Y heterozygous, compound C282Y/H63D heterozygous, or have no known mutation. A third mutation, S65C, has been associated with HH, but this finding is disputed. We have studied the clinical significance of various genotypes with the S65C mutation. In a population-based screening for HH in 65,238 persons, 613 had high serum transferrin saturation in two blood samples and were invited for HFE genotyping. In 556 persons with complete data sets, we studied the serum ferritin concentration and the risk of being diagnosed with phenotypic HH in the various genotypic groups. The phenotypic diagnosis was given without knowing the genotypic result. Except for the C282Y homozygotes, no differences in median serum ferritin concentrations were found between the various genotypic groups. However, the C282Y/S65C compound heterozygous group had a higher risk of being diagnosed with phenotypic HH than the wild-type group, as did the C282Y homozygous and the C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous groups. When combined with the C282Y mutation, the S65C mutation is associated with an increased risk of being diagnosed with phenotypic HH.	12180078
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Unsaturated iron binding capacity and transferrin saturation are equally reliable in detection of HFE hemochromatosis.	The American journal of gastroenterology	2002	0.5	Unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) has been proposed as an inexpensive alternative to transferrin saturation for detection of hereditary hemochromatosis. The aim of this study was to compare, in a hospital referral clinic, the reliability of transferrin saturation and UIBC for detection of subjects who have inherited HFE (HLA-asociated iron overload) genotypes predisposing to iron overload. Serum transferrin saturation, UIBC, and ferritin were tested in 110 consecutive subjects. Optimum thresholds were determined from receiver operating characteristic curves. Of 110 subjects, 44 carried significant HFE mutations (C282Y/C282Y or C282Y/H63D). In genetically predisposed subjects with biochemical expression, the optimum threshold for transferrin saturation was 43%, giving a sensitivity of 0.88 and specificity 0.95. For UIBC, the optimum threshold was 143 microg/dL (25.6 micromol/L), giving a sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.95. In patients referred with a family history or clinical suspicion of hemochromatosis, transferrin saturation and UIBC were highly reliable predictors of genotype. In patients referred for investigation of abnormal liver enzymes without a known family history of hemochromatosis, a normal transferrin saturation or normal UIBC was highly reliable in excluding hemochromatosis. Transferrin saturation and UIBC have equal reliability in ability to predict hemochromatosis. UIBC should be considered as an alternative to transferrin saturation in detection of hemochromatosis.	12190182
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Sequence variation and haplotype structure at the human HFE locus.	Genetics	2002	4.64	The HFE locus encodes an HLA class-I-type protein important in iron regulation and segregates replacement mutations that give rise to the most common form of genetic hemochromatosis. The high frequency of one disease-associated mutation, C282Y, and the nature of this disease have led some to suggest a selective advantage for this mutation. To investigate the context in which this mutation arose and gain a better understanding of HFE genetic variation, we surveyed nucleotide variability in 11.2 kb encompassing the HFE locus and experimentally determined haplotypes. We fully resequenced 60 chromosomes of African, Asian, or European ancestry as well as one chimpanzee, revealing 41 variable sites and a nucleotide diversity of 0.08%. This indicates that linkage to the HLA region has not substantially increased the level of HFE variation. Although several haplotypes are shared between populations, one haplotype predominates in Asia but is nearly absent elsewhere, causing higher than average genetic differentiation among the three major populations. Our samples show evidence of intragenic recombination, so the scarcity of recombination events within the C282Y allele class is consistent with selection increasing the frequency of a young allele. Otherwise, the pattern of variability in this region does not clearly indicate the action of positive selection at this or linked loci.	12196404
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Epidemic pathogenic selection: an explanation for hereditary hemochromatosis?	Medical hypotheses	2002	1.14	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a disorder associated with progressive iron overload and deposition in multiple organs. It is the most common inherited single gene disorder in people of Northern and Western European descent. About 80% of individuals of European descent with HH are homozygous for a cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution (C282Y) in the gene now called HFE. The function of HFE protein, a major histocompatibility class I-like transmembrane protein, has not been fully elucidated. Three consequences of the C282Y mutation are lack of expression of HFE on the cellular surface, a lowered iron level in macrophages, and an increased rate of clearance of iron from the intestinal lumen. These changes could confer protection against certain pathogens early in life before iron overload occurs. Furthermore, the C282Y mutation might have been selected for during the European plagues caused by Yersinia spp. and other pathogens because of the conferred resistance to infection, i.e., by epidemic pathogenic selection.	12208162
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Novel aspects of pathogenesis of hereditary hemochromatosis].	Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego	2008	0.5	"""Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HC) may present a plenty of clinical symptoms, thus are referred to various specialists and may prone a significant diagnostic dillema. The molecular basis of hemochromatosis is more complex than expected. In 1996 HFE gene was identified and its main mutations (C282Y and H63D) were described as well as their high frequency in population of European descent. Them: Most patients with clinical symptoms of hemochromatosis are homozygous for C282Y but it is also clear that some families are linked to rarer conditions, named """"non-HFE hemochromatosis"""". Between 2000-2004 other genes involved in iron homeostasis were intensively studied, leading to recognition of hepcidin (HAMP) - the most important iron hormone, hemojuvelin (HJV), transferin receptor 2 (TfR2) and ferroportin. Recent findings led to novel hypothesis on potential digenic modes of inheritance or the involvement of modifier genes. Hepcidin plays a central role in mobilization of iron, HFE, TfR2 and HJV playing a modulating role in its production, related to the body's iron status. It has also been demonstrated that HAMP negatively regulates cellular iron efflux by affecting the ferroportin cell surface availability. The result of such a wide investigations is OMIM classification of hereditaty hemochromatosis, typing four types of the disease."""	18634255
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Risk factors for development of dementia in a unique six-year cohort study. I. An exploratory, pilot study of involvement of the E4 allele of apolipoprotein E, mutations of the hemochromatosis-HFE gene, type 2 diabetes, and stroke.	Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD	2014	0.5	Risk factors for dementia development are not well-defined. We evaluated several factors alone and in combination in a unique cohort of Caucasian volunteers over an approximately 6-year observation window using a nested case/control design. Factors included: apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene variants (the E4 allele is the strongest confirmed genetic predisposing factor for Alzheimer's disease), the hemochromatosis-HFE gene mutations (H63D and C282Y), diabetes, and stroke. At study entry, subjects were ≥65 years of age (M ± SD = 73.0 ± 4.9), had an MMSE score ≥24, and no evidence of cerebrovascular disease or current depression. Genotyping was completed on 163 available DNA samples from three different groups at the study end: those who still had normal cognitive function; those who had developed dementia; and those with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Analyses were interpreted at the 95% confidence level without Bonferroni corrections. In the subgroup with dementia, all cases of diabetes were type 2 and present at study entry, whereas all strokes occurred during the study. The results highlight apparently synergistic interactions between genetic and medical risk factors for dementia development, gender differences in risk factors, and involvement of HFE mutations. Having E4 (i.e., either of E3/4 or E4/4), C282Y, H63D, diabetes, or stroke alone did not attain significance. Significant predisposing factors with post-hoc power ≥80% were: E4 homozygosity (E4/4)males+females, odds ratio (OR) = 56.0); E4+diabetes (males+females, OR = 13.7; E4+H63D+diabetes (females, OR = 52.0); E4+stroke (males, OR = 46.5). The importance of preventing diabetes and stroke to ward off dementia and the possible role of iron dysmetabolism in dementia are discussed.	24081379
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The effect of HFE polymorphisms on cardiac iron overload in patients with beta-thalassemia major.	Pediatric hematology and oncology	2013	1.09	We aimed to investigate the effect of human hemochromatosis protein (HFE) polymorphisms on cardiac iron overload in patients with beta-thalassemia major. Our study included 33 patients diagnosed with beta-thalassemia major who were treated with regular transfusions and chelation therapy. M-mode, tissue Doppler, and pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography were performed on all patients. T2* magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were also performed. The HFE polymorphisms (H63D, C282Y, S65C, Q283P, E168Q, E168X, W169X, P160delC, Q127H, H63H, V59M, and V53M) were studied using polymerase chain reaction. The H63D polymorphism was detected in six patients with beta-thalassemia major. Five patients were heterozygous for the H63D polymorphism, while one was homozygous. There were no other polymorphisms. There was no relationship between the HFE polymorphisms and either the serum ferritin levels or the T2-weighted MRI values (P > .05). Moreover, conventional echo and tissue Doppler echo findings were not correlated with the HFE polymorphisms. Pulmonary vein atrial reversal flow velocity, which is a manifestation of diastolic dysfunction measured with pulse wave echo, was higher in the patients with HFE polymorphisms (P = .036). The HFE polymorphisms had no effect on cardiac iron overload. However, pulmonary vein atrial reversal flow velocity measurements can provide important information for detecting diastolic dysfunction during cardiac follow-up of patients with HFE polymorphisms. Studies with more patients are needed to provide more information regarding this matter.	24087894
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequencies of the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) variants C282Y, H63D and S65C in 6,020 ethnic Danish men.	Annals of hematology	2008	3.02	The objective was to assess the frequencies of haemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations or variants C282Y, H63D and S65C in ethnic Danes. This is a prospective epidemiologic population study. A cohort of 6,020 Danish men aged 30-50 years was screened for HFE C282Y (c845G-->A), H63D (c187C-->G) and S65C (c193A-->T) gene variants, assessed on saliva or blood samples by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The C282Y gene variant allele was present in 5.6%, H63D in 12.8% and S65C in 1.8% of the chromosomes. In the entire series, we observed 1.4% H63D/C282Y, 0.1% S65C/C282Y and 0.4% H63D/S65C compound heterozygotes. The C282Y allele frequency in Denmark is of similar order as reported in other Scandinavian countries: Iceland 5.1%, Faeroe Islands 6.6%, Norway 6.8% and Sweden 5.8%. Also, the H63D frequency in Denmark is close to the frequencies in other Scandinavian countries: Iceland 10.9%, Faeroe Islands 15.2%, Norway 11.4% and Sweden 12.1%.	18542962
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum hepcidin levels are innately low in HFE-related haemochromatosis but differ between C282Y-homozygotes with elevated and normal ferritin levels.	British journal of haematology	2008	5.4	HFE C282Y-homozygosity has been associated with low hepcidin expression, leading to increased ferritin levels. However, serum hepcidin protein levels have not been documented in humans. In the current study, we compared serum hepcidin levels of newly diagnosed HFE C282Y-homozygotes with (N = 15) and without (N = 7) elevated serum ferritin levels to levels of 40 controls (20 heterozygotes and 20 wild types). In addition, hepcidin levels of four C282Y homozygotes were investigated during the course of all phlebotomy treatment phases. Serum hepcidin levels were lower in HFE C282Y-homozygotes (median; 25th-75th percentile: 1.88; 0.78-2.77 nmol/l) compared to controls (2.74; 1.45-5.39). Hepcidin/ferritin ratios were also lower in homozygotes. Homozygotes with an elevated serum ferritin had a higher serum hepcidin but a lower hepcidin/ferritin ratio than those with normal ferritin (2.28; 1.62-3.23 nmol/l hepcidin vs. 0.80; 0.60-1.29 and 3.63; 2.72-7.59 pmol hepcidin/microg ferritin vs. 13.2; 5.15-14.2). Serum hepcidin decreased during the depletion phase of phlebotomy and remained low during maintenance. This study showed that serum hepcidin is innately low in HFE-related haemochromatosis. Elevated ferritin levels were associated with increased hepcidin levels while erythropoiesis lead to lower hepcidin levels. During depletion, therefore, hepcidin levels are decreased, which may exacerbate intestinal iron absorption.	18557745
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	High prevalence of HFE gene mutations in patients with porphyria cutanea tarda in the Czech Republic.	The British journal of dermatology	2008	0.5	Iron overload and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are independent factors which are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). To determine the prevalence of the HFE gene mutations p.Cys282Tyr (C282Y), p.His63Asp (H63D) and p.Ser65Cys (S65C), the p.Tyr250X (Y250X) mutation of the TFR2 gene, and HCV infection in patients with PCT in the Czech population, and to make comparison of the iron status among the respective genotypes. Iron metabolism indices, results of mutational analysis and serological markers of HCV infection were examined in 63 patients with PCT. The HFE gene mutations were detected in 70% of patients with PCT compared with 35% in the control group (P < 0.001). Mean serum ferritin levels were increased in all genotypes, the highest being in homozygotes for the p.Cys282Tyr mutation. HCV infection was detected in only 8% of patients with PCT. There was a very high prevalence of the p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp mutations observed in patients with PCT accompanied by mild degrees of iron overload, which was genotype dependent.	18565178

Diabetes care	2008	8.93	To examine the relationship between iron status, hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations, and clinical features and outcomes of type 2 diabetes in a well-characterized representative sample of community-based patients. HFE genotype data were available for 1,245 type 2 diabetic patients from the longitudinal observational Fremantle Diabetes Study (FDS), representing 96.2% of the total FDS type 2 diabetes cohort. Data were collected at recruitment between 1993 and 1996 and annually until the end of June 2001. Hospitalization and mortality data were available until the end of June 2006. The presence of the C282Y HFE mutation was determined in all subjects and H63D in C282Y heterozygotes. Fasting serum iron, transferrin, and ferritin were measured in all C282Y homozygotes and C282Y/H63D heterozygotes and in 286 randomly selected wild-type subjects. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent baseline associates of prevalent complications (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy), as was Cox proportional hazards modeling to determine predictors of incident complications and mortality. Although there were expected positive associations between HFE gene mutations and serum iron and transferrin saturation, there were no independent positive associations between HFE gene status and either microvascular or macrovascular complications in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. HFE gene status did not independently predict cardiac or all-cause mortality. Measures of iron metabolism including serum ferritin were not associated with combined microvascular or macrovascular end points. Directed screening for iron overload and/or HFE mutations appears unwarranted in patients with type 2 diabetes.	18566337
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Importance of 5569G/A polymorphism in intron 4 of HFE gene in the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis].	Medicina clinica	2001	1.27	The presence of the 5569A polymorphism may lead to misdiagnosis of patients susceptible of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). For that reason, samples containing the Cys282Tyr mutation were revised and the frequency of this polymorphism in our environment was assessed. Twenty samples were retested and 56 controls were included. The study was performed by PCR-RFLP. The diagnosis was confirmed in 8 cases susceptible of error. However, an amplification deficiency of normal alleles was detected in 2 heterozygous (17%). The allelic frequency of the 5569A polymorphism in the control population was 14.3%. Although misdiagnosis was not committed, we recommend changing to any primer that does not include the 5569G/A polymorphism in the study of HH.	11730630
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haptoglobin phenotype 2-2 overrepresentation in Cys282Tyr hemochromatotic patients.	Journal of hepatology	2001	10.59	Patients with genotypic Cys282Tyr homozygous hemochromatosis differ largely in phenotypic presentation. The HFE mutation on itself does not explain the different manifestations of hemochromatosis. We hypothesized that the genetic haptoglobin (Hp) polymorphism, because of its effect on iron metabolism, could be a modifying factor that influences the clinical presentation of hereditary hemochromatosis. In 167 Cys282Tyr homozygous hemochromatotic patients, the frequencies of Hp types (1-1, 2-1 and 2-2) and alleles (Hp1, Hp2) were compared with those in 918 healthy subjects. Clinical and laboratory indices of iron overload were incorporated in the analysis. The Hp 2-2 type was overrepresented in the patient group (P<0.01). Male patients carrying Hp 2-2 had higher serum iron (P=0.003) and ferritin levels (P=0.03) than those with a Hp 1-1 or 2-1 type. The amount of iron removed with phlebotomy was also higher in Hp 2-2 patients (P=0.03). The Hp 2-2 type is overrepresented among Cys282Tyr homozygous hemochromatotic patients. At diagnosis, iron overload was more pronounced in male patients carrying Hp 2-2. Our data suggest that Hp polymorphism affects iron metabolism in hereditary hemochromatosis.	11738096
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency in Central Europe: discrepancy between biochemical and molecular genetic screening for homocystinuric alleles.	Human mutation	2001	5.09	Recent reports suggested that homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a more common inborn error of metabolism than originally thought. In this study we compared the prevalence of homocystinuric alleles ascertained by two different approaches. First, the incidence of homocystinuria estimated by selective biochemical screening in the Czech and Slovak Republics was 1:349,000 (95% CI 1:208,000-1:641,000). The two most common pathogenic mutant alleles found subsequently in these patients, IVS11-2A>C and c.833T>C, had a calculated population prevalence of 0.00042 (95% CI 0.00031-0.00055) and 0.00018 (95% CI 0.00013-0.00023), respectively. Second, to examine the possible negative detection bias of mildly affected patients we determined the prevalence of these two pathogenic mutations in a sample of 1284 unselected newborns. Indeed, the observed prevalence of the c.833T>C allele (0.00195, 95% CI 0.00063-0.00454) was 11x higher than in the previous group suggesting that many homozygotes for the c.833T>C had not been diagnosed by selective biochemical screening. The IVS11-2A>C allele was not detected among 2,568 newborn CBS alleles. The estimated incidence of homocystinuria of 1:83,000, calculated in a combined model, suggests that selective biochemical screening may ascertain only approximately 25% of all homocystinuric patients. In conclusion, homocystinuria in Central Europe may be sufficiently common to consider sensitive newborn screening programs for this disease.	11748855
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Potential nonresponse bias in a clinical examination after initial screening using iron phenotyping and HFE genotyping in the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening study.	Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers	2009	1.3	Little is known about the factors affecting participation in clinical assessments after HEmochromatosis and IRon Overload Screening. Initial screening of 101,168 primary care patients in the HEmochromatosis and IRon Overload Screening study was performed using serum iron measures and hemochromatosis gene (HFE) genotyping. Using iron phenotypes and HFE genotypes, we identified 2256 cases and 1232 controls eligible to participate in a clinical examination. To assess the potential for nonresponse bias, we compared the sociodemographic, health status, and attitudinal characteristics of participants and nonparticipants using adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Overall participation was 74% in cases and 52% in controls; in both groups, participation was highest at a health maintenance organization and lowest among those under 45 years of age (cases: OR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.53, 0.87; controls: OR = 0.59; 95% CI 0.44, 0.78). In controls only, participation was also lower among those over 65 years of age than the reference group aged 46-64 (OR = 0.64; 95% CI 0.47, 0.88). Among cases, participation was higher in HFE C282Y homozygotes (OR = 3.98; 95% CI 2.60, 6.09), H63D homozygotes (OR = 2.79; 95% CI 1.23, 6.32), and C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes (OR = 1.82; 95% CI 1.03, 3.22) than in other genotypes, and lower among non-Caucasians and those who preferred a non-English language than in Caucasians and those who preferred English (p < 0.0001). Subjects with greatest risk to have iron overload (C282Y homozygotes; cases > or =45 years; Caucasians) were more likely to participate in a postscreening clinical examination than other subjects. We detected no evidence of strong selection bias.	19860558
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effect of HFE variants on sphingolipid expression by SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells.	Neurochemical research	2011	2.47	C282Y and H63D are two common variants of the hemochromatosis protein HFE. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells stably transfected to express either wild type HFE (WT-HFE), or the C282Y or H63D allele were analyzed for effect of expression of the mutant proteins on transcription of 14 enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism. Cells expressing the C282Y variant showed significant increases (>2-fold) in transcription of five genes and decreases in two compared to that seen for cells expressing WT-HFE, while cells expressing the H63D variant showed an elevation in transcription of one gene and a decrease in two. These changes were seen as alterations in ganglioside composition, cell surface binding by the binding subunit of cholera toxin, expression of sphingosine-kinase-1 and synthesis of sphingosine-1-phosphate. These changes may explain why C282Y-HFE is a risk factor for colon and breast cancer and possibly protective against Alzheimer's disease while H63D-HFE is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases.	21243428
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HRD1 and UBE2J1 target misfolded MHC class I heavy chains for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	2011	9.42	The assembly of MHC class I molecules is governed by stringent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control mechanisms. MHC class I heavy chains that fail to achieve their native conformation in complex with β2-microglobulin (β2m) and peptide are targeted for ER-associated degradation. This requires ubiquitination of the MHC class I heavy chain and its dislocation from the ER to the cytosol for proteasome-mediated degradation, although the cellular machinery involved in this process is unknown. Using an siRNA functional screen in β2m-depleted cells, we identify an essential role for the E3 ligase HRD1 (Synoviolin) together with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2J1 in the ubiquitination and dislocation of misfolded MHC class I heavy chains. HRD1 is also required for the ubiquitination and degradation of the naturally occurring hemochromatosis-associated HFE-C282Y mutant, which is unable to bind β2m. In the absence of HRD1, misfolded HLA-B27 accumulated in cells with a normal MHC class I assembly pathway, and HRD1 depletion prevented the appearance of low levels of cytosolic unfolded MHC I heavy chains. HRD1 and UBE2J1 associate in a complex together with non-β2m bound MHC class I heavy chains, Derlin 1, and p97 and discriminate misfolded MHC class I from conformational MHC I-β2m-peptide heterotrimers. Together these data support a physiological role for HRD1 and UBE2J1 in the homeostatic regulation of MHC class I assembly and expression.	21245296
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The impact of population-based screening studies on hemochromatosis screening practices.	Digestive diseases and sciences	2012	2.52	To determine if community population screening studies for hemochromatosis affected HFE genetic screening practices in non-study populations. An audit of all genetic testing for HFE mutations at London Health Sciences Center, London, Ontario, Canada from 1997 to 2010 was performed. The frequency of genetic testing and the frequency of C282Y homozygous cases identified during the years of the London Red Cross (1998-1999) and HEIRS (2000-2005) screening studies were compared with the corresponding frequencies in the specified years outside this range (1997-1998 and 2006-2010). An increase in HFE gene mutation testing is seen during the London Red Cross study, and the frequency of testing rose further during the HEIRS study. Genetic screening activity continued to increase in the years after publication of the HEIRS study. The proportion of patients with homozygosity for C282Y mutation remained relatively constant despite fluctuations in numbers of persons screened per annum. The rise in HFE gene testing among non-study populations during the HH studies could be explained by the Hawthorne effect, a phenomenon referring to the improvement or modification of behavior by a population as a consequence of it being studied. In this case, we postulate that primary care physicians at our center performed more HFE gene tests for their patients as a consequence of being affected by knowledge of the screening studies. Despite a general increase in testing during and after completion of the studies, the total number of hemochromatosis cases (C282Y homozygotes) diagnosed per annum remained relatively constant.	22160492
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Probability of C282Y homozygosity decreases as liver transaminase activities increase in participants with hyperferritinemia in the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening study.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2012	0.5	Hemochromatosis is considered by many to be an uncommon disorder, although the prevalence of HFE (High Iron) 282 Cys → Tyr (C282Y) homozygosity is relatively high in Caucasians. Liver disease is one of the most consistent findings in advanced iron overload resulting from hemochromatosis. Liver clinics are often thought to be ideal venues for diagnosis of hemochromatosis, but diagnosis rates are often low. The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study screened 99,711 primary care participants in North America for iron overload using serum ferritin and transferrin saturation measurements and HFE genotyping. In this HEIRS substudy, serum hepatic transaminases activities (e.g., alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) were compared between 162 C282Y homozygotes and 1,367 nonhomozygotes with serum ferritin levels >300 μg/L in men and >200 μg/L in women and transferrin saturation >45% in women and 50% in men. The probability of being a C282Y homozygote was determined for AST and ALT ranges. Mean ALT and AST activities were significantly lower in C282Y homozygotes than nonhomozygotes. The probability of being a C282Y homozygote increased as the ALT and AST activities decreased. Patients with hyperferritinemia are more likely to be C282Y homozygotes if they have normal liver transaminase activities. This paradox could explain the low yields of hemochromatosis screening reported by some liver clinics.	22183642
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Comparison of oxidative stress and the frequency of polymorphisms in the HFE gene between hemoglobin S trait blood donors and sickle cell disease patients.	Genetics and molecular research : GMR	2011	0.76	It is well documented that Hb S and iron affect blood cells, and trigger oxidative processes and generation of free radicals with potential for lipid peroxidation. We evaluated the frequency of polymorphisms in the HFE gene in Hb AS blood donors and how these polymorphisms influenced lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity. Blood samples were collected from 211 Hb AS blood donors, 119 Hb AA blood donors as a control group, and 28 sickle cell disease patients (Hb SS). The H63D allele was found at a frequency of 10.5% in the Hb AS samples, and the C282Y allele frequency was 0.7%. In the control group, the frequencies of the H63D and C282Y alleles were 13.4 and 2.1%, respectively. In the sickle-cell disease patients, the H63D and the C282Y allele frequencies were 10.7 and 3.5%, respectively. The frequencies of the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in Hb AS blood donors are similar to those reported for the Brazilian population. Serum malondialdehyde values, indicative of lipid peroxidation, were highest in sickle cell patients, independent of the polymorphisms in the HFE gene, with significant differences, showing the influence of Hb S allele in the levels of lipid peroxidation. However, the trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity average levels, indicative of the antioxidant capacity, were reduced with significant differences, indicating that in spite of a lipid peroxidation raise, this is not followed by the increased of the antioxidant capacity, leading to oxidative stress.	22183944
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis in a Brazilian university hospital in São Paulo State (1990-2000).	Genetics and molecular research : GMR	2005	0.76	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is the most common genetic disease among individuals of European descent. Two mutations (845G-->A, C282Y and 187C-->G, H63D) in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE gene) are associated with HH. About 85-90% of patients of northern European descent with HH are C282Y homozygous. The prevalence of HH in the Brazilian population, which has a very high level of racial admixture, is unknown. The aims of the present study were to identify individuals with diagnostic criteria for HH among patients with a body iron overload attended at the university hospital of the Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto from 1990 to 2000, and to evaluate the prevalence of HFE mutations. We screened first-degree relatives for HFE mutations. Four of 72 patients (three men and one woman, mean age 47 years) fulfilled the criteria for HH. HFE mutations were studied in three patients [two C282Y homozygotes (patients 1 and 2) and one H63D heterozygote]. Patient 1 had four children (all C282Y heterozygotes with no iron overload) and seven brothers and sisters: two sisters (66 and 76 years old) were C282Y homozygotes and both had an iron overload (a liver biopsy in one showed severe iron deposits), one sister (79 years old) was a compound heterozygote with no iron overload, one brother (78 years old) was a C282Y heterozygote with no iron overload, two individuals were H63D heterozygotes (one brother, 49 years old, obese, with a body iron overload and abnormal liver enzymes - a biopsy showed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and one 70-year-old sister with no iron overload). Patient 2 had two children (22 and 24 years old who were C282Y heterozygotes with no iron overload) but no brothers or sisters. These results showed that HH was uncommon among individuals attended at our hospital, although HFE mutations were found in all patients. Familial screening is valuable for the early diagnosis of individuals at risk since it allows treatment to be initiated before the onset of the clinical manifestations of organ damage associated with HH.	15841433
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis and iron-overload screening in a racially diverse population.	The New England journal of medicine	2005	0.5	Iron overload and hemochromatosis are common, treatable conditions. HFE genotypes, levels of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation values, and self-reported medical history were studied in a multiethnic primary care population. Participants were recruited from primary care practices and blood-drawing laboratories. Blood samples were tested for transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. Before genetic screening, participants were asked whether they had a history of medical conditions related to iron overload. Of the 99,711 participants, 299 were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. The estimated prevalence of C282Y homozygotes was higher in non-Hispanic whites (0.44 percent) than in Native Americans (0.11 percent), Hispanics (0.027 percent), blacks (0.014 percent), Pacific Islanders (0.012 percent), or Asians (0.000039 percent). Among participants who were homozygous for the C282Y mutation but in whom iron overload had not been diagnosed (227 participants), serum ferritin levels were greater than 300 mug per liter in 78 of 89 men (88 percent) and greater than 200 microg per liter in 79 of 138 women (57 percent). Pacific Islanders and Asians had the highest geometric mean levels of serum ferritin and mean transferrin saturation despite having the lowest prevalence of C282Y homozygotes. There were 364 participants in whom iron overload had not been diagnosed (29 C282Y homozygotes) who had a serum ferritin level greater than 1000 microg per liter. Among men, C282Y homozygotes and compound heterozygotes were more likely to report a history of liver disease than were participants without HFE mutations. The C282Y mutation is most common in whites, and most C282Y homozygotes have elevations in serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation. The C282Y mutation does not account for high mean serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation values in nonwhites.	15858186
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of HFE and TFR2 gene mutations in patients with acute leukemia.	Leukemia research	2005	2.61	There are increasing evidences regarding the association between iron overload and extra-hepatic malignancies. We studied the prevalence of 12 hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) gene mutations (C282Y, V53M, V59M, H63D, H63H, S56C, Q127H, E168Q, E168X, W169X and Q283P in the HFE gene and Y250X in the TFR2 gene) and its correlation with the iron status in 82 adult patients with acute leukemia (AL); 48 patients (58.5%) were affected by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 34 patients (41.5%) by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); 27 patients (32.9%) had at least one HH gene mutation (6 heterozygous for C282Y, 6 homozygous for H63D, 13 heterozygous for H63D and 2 heterozygous for S56C). Mean serum ferritin levels at diagnosis were increased (822.5+/-811.4 microg/L). However, there was no difference between patients positive or negative for the HH gene mutations. Similarly, we did not observe any statistically significant difference as far as iron status between AML and ALL patients. Our study does not support the evidence of an association between hemochromatosis gene mutations and iron overload in AL patients.	15863206
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Reverse cascade screening of newborns for hereditary haemochromatosis: a model for other late onset diseases?	Journal of medical genetics	2005	5.65	Genetic testing can determine those at risk for hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) caused by HFE mutations before the onset of symptoms. However, there is no optimum screening strategy, mainly owing to the variable penetrance in those who are homozygous for the HFE Cys282Tyr (C282Y) mutation. The objective of this study was to identify the majority of individuals at serious risk of developing HFE haemochromatosis before they developed life threatening complications. We first estimated the therapeutic penetrance of the C282Y mutation in people living in la Somme, France, using genetic, demographic, biochemical, and follow up data. We examined the benefits of neonatal screening on the basis of increased risk to relatives of newborns carrying one or two copies of the C282Y mutation. Between 1999 and 2002, we screened 7038 newborns from two maternity hospitals in the north of France for the C282Y and His63Asp (H63D) mutations in the HFE gene, using bloodspots collected on Guthrie cards. Family studies and genetic counselling were undertaken, based on the results of the baby's genotype. In la Somme, we found that 24% of the adults homozygous for the C282Y mutation required at least 5 g iron to be removed to restore normal iron parameters (that is, the therapeutic penetrance). In the reverse cascade screening study, we identified 19 C282Y homozygotes (1/370), 491 heterozygotes (1/14) and 166 compound heterozygotes (1/42) in 7038 newborns tested. The reverse cascade screening strategy resulted in 80 adults being screened for both mutations. We identified 10 previously unknown C282Y homozygotes of whom six (four men and two women) required venesection. Acceptance of neonatal screening was high; parents understood the risks of having HH and the benefits of early detection, but a number of parents were reluctant to take the test themselves. Neonatal screening for HH is straightforward. Reverse cascade screening increased the efficiency of detecting affected adults with undiagnosed haemochromatosis. This strategy allows almost complete coverage for HH and could be a model for efficient screening for other late onset genetic diseases.	15863667
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Ribavirin in the treatment of hepatitis C.	Anticancer research		1.9	The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, with approximately 170-200 million people infected. The HCV virus is transmitted by blood and blood products and such transmission occurs primarily through drug use by injection, sex with an infected partner and occupational exposure. The severity of the disease varies widely from mild chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nowadays, the reference treatment is combination therapy of pegylated interferon and ribavirin, which is an inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitor and immunomodulator. Efficacy of treatment in our clinical trials is 87% in patients infected by HCV genotypes 2 or 3, whereas in patients infected by HCV genotype 1 response to treatment is 66%. The current combination treatment has significant side-effects and sometimes is poorly tolerated. HCV genotypes 2 or 3 can be treated with a lower dose of ribavirin and a shorter course of therapy, 24 weeks vs 48 weeks for patients with genotype 1. There is a growing consensus that acute control of HCV infection is associated with a vigorous intrahepatic antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell response, enhanced Th1 and natural killer activity. Pretreatment genotype and response to therapy measured at weeks 12 and 24 of treatment have been identified as key determinants in decisions about continuing treatment. Elevated serum ferritin levels and hepatic iron deposition as well as hepatic steatosis and high ALT levels with chronic hepatitis C are risk factors for HCC development. Heterozygosityfor the C282Y mutation in HFE contributes to iron accumulation and fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis C. Ribavirin could cause dose-dependent reversible haemolytic anaemia, which can be managed with dose reductions or with administration of epoetin alpha at 40,000 IU once weekly without sacrificing the optimal dosing of ribavarin. Among patients who received ribavirin alone, serum ALT levels and necroinflammatory features of liver histology were improved, whereas symptoms, HCV RNA levels and hepatic fibrosis scores were not changed significantly from baseline. For HCV-HIV co-infected patients, treatment is given when blood CD4 counts are above 350/ml and before antiretroviral (ART) treatment is needed.	15865084
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations of the HFE gene among Turkish hereditary hemochromatosis patients.	Annals of hematology	2005	3.02	Since the discovery of the HFE gene, C282Y and H63D mutations have been reported as significantly correlated with clinically manifested hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). As the other genes involved in iron metabolism have been described, non-HFE cases of HH have been identified. Since in the general Turkish population, the C282Y mutation is not found and the H63D mutation is of high frequency, we aimed to determine mutations in the HFE genes in our patients with HH. The HFE gene of the five patients with HH were sequenced. C282Y mutation was absent, and all HH patients were heterozygote for H63D mutation. No other mutation was found in HFE gene by sequencing. Although the higher allele frequency of the H63D mutation in Turkish HH patients than in the general population implies a role of the H63D mutation in iron overload, there is a strong possibility that Turkish HH patients have non-HFE hemochromatosis.	15871018
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Natural selection on HFE in Asian populations contributes to enhanced non-heme iron absorption.	BMC genetics	2015	2.15	HFE, a major regulator of iron (Fe) homeostasis, has been suggested to be under positive selection in both European and Asian populations. While the genetic variant under selection in Europeans (a non-synonymous mutation, C282Y) has been relatively well-studied, the adaptive variant in Asians and its functional consequences are still unknown. Identifying the adaptive HFE variants in Asians will not only elucidate the evolutionary history and the genetic basis of population difference in Fe status, but also assist the future practice of genome-informed dietary recommendation. Using data from the International HapMap Project, we confirmed the signatures of positive selection on HFE in Asian populations and identified a candidate adaptive haplotype that is common in Asians (52.35-54.71%) but rare in Europeans (5.98%) and Africans (4.35%). The T allele at tag SNP rs9366637 (C/T) captured 95.8% of this Asian-common haplotype. A significantly reduced HFE expression was observed in individuals carrying T/T at rs9366637 compared to C/C and C/T, indicating a possible role of gene regulation in adaptation. We recruited 57 women of Asian descent and measured Fe absorption using stable isotopes in those homozygous at rs9366637. We observed a 22% higher absorption in women homozygous for the Asian-common haplotype (T/T) compared to the control genotype (C/C). Additionally, compared with a group of age-matched Caucasian women, Asian women exhibited significantly elevated Fe absorption. Our results indicate parallel adaptation of HFE gene in Europeans and Asians with different genetic variants. Moreover, natural selection on HFE may have contributed to elevated Fe absorption in Asians. This study regarding population differences in Fe homeostasis has significant medical impact as high Fe level has been linked to an increased disease risk of metabolic syndromes.	26054392
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepcidin induction by transgenic overexpression of Hfe does not require the Hfe cytoplasmic tail, but does require hemojuvelin.	Blood	2010	11.84	Mutations in HFE cause the most common form of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). We previously showed that liver-specific, transgenic overexpression of murine Hfe stimulates production of the iron regulatory hormone hepcidin. Here, we developed several additional transgenic mouse strains to further interrogate the structural basis of HFE function in the pathophysiology of HH. We hypothesized that the small, cytoplasmic domain of HFE might be necessary for HFE-mediated induction of hepcidin. We demonstrate that, like the full-length protein, overexpression of Hfe proteins lacking the cytoplasmic domain leads to hepcidin induction, iron deficiency and a hypochromic, microcytic anemia. However, high-level expression of a liver-specific Hfe transgene carrying the mouse equivalent of the common HFE C282Y human disease-causing mutation (murine C294Y) did not cause iron deficiency. Furthermore, hepcidin induction by transgenes encoding both WT Hfe and Hfe lacking its cytoplasmic domain is greatly attenuated in the absence of hemojuvelin (Hjv). Our observations indicate that the extracellular and transmembrane domains of Hfe are sufficient, and Hjv is essential, for Hfe-mediated induction of hepcidin expression.	20837779
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Molecular diagnosis of genetic iron-overload disorders.	Expert review of molecular diagnostics	2010	3.33	Genetic iron overload has long been confined to the picture of classical hemochromatosis related to the HFE C282Y mutation (type 1 hemochromatosis). C282Y homozygosity affects approximately three people out of 1000 of the Caucasian population, representing one of the most frequent genetic predispositions. It has, however, rapidly become clear that the HFE C282Y mutation is not the sole culprit in genetic iron overload. Several novel mutations in HFE and other genes have been discovered and related to various entities, which are now known as types 2, 3 and 4 hemochromatosis. These diseases are far less frequent than the classical type 1 hemochromatosis but, by contrast, are not limited to the Caucasian population. Molecular diagnosis obviously plays a key role in the diagnostic strategy. In the future, it will undoubtedly enable not only identification of new diagnostic markers, but also provide potential molecular targets for pathophysiologically based innovative therapeutic approaches.	20843199
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations in patients with primary iron overload: is there a significant improvement in molecular diagnosis yield with HFE sequencing?	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2010	0.5	Rare HFE variants have been shown to be associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron overload disease. The low frequency of the HFE p.C282Y mutation in HH-affected Brazilian patients may suggest that other HFE-related mutations may also be implicated in the pathogenesis of HH in this population. The main aim was to screen for new HFE mutations in Brazilian individuals with primary iron overload and to investigate their relationship with HH. Fifty Brazilian patients with primary iron overload (transferrin saturation>50% in females and 60% in males) were selected. Subsequent bidirectional sequencing for each HFE exon was performed. The effect of HFE mutations on protein structure were analyzed by molecular dynamics simulation and free binding energy calculations. p.C282Y in homozygosis or in heterozygosis with p.H63D were the most frequent genotypic combinations associated with HH in our sample population (present in 17 individuals, 34%). Thirty-six (72.0%) out of the 50 individuals presented at least one HFE mutation. The most frequent genotype associated with HH was the homozygous p.C282Y mutation (n=11, 22.0%). One novel mutation (p.V256I) was indentified in heterozygosis with the p.H63D mutation. In silico modeling analysis of protein behavior indicated that the p.V256I mutation does not reduce the binding affinity between HFE and β2-microglobulin (β2M) in the same way the p.C282Y mutation does compared with the native HFE protein. In conclusion, screening of HFE through direct sequencing, as compared to p.C282Y/p.H63D genotyping, was not able to increase the molecular diagnosis yield of HH. The novel p.V256I mutation could not be implicated in the molecular basis of the HH phenotype, although its role cannot be completely excluded in HH-phenotype development. Our molecular modeling analysis can help in the analysis of novel, previously undescribed, HFE mutations.	20843714
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepatic iron overload in patients with chronic viral hepatitis: role of HFE gene mutations.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	1998	0.5	Mild to moderate hepatic iron overload is frequent in patients with chronic viral hepatitis (CH). We evaluated the role of hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations and other acquired factors in the development of iron overload in these patients. We studied 110 patients with chronic B or C viral hepatitis (31 women, 79 men), including 20 with cirrhosis, and 139 controls. Hepatic iron was evaluated by semiquantitative analysis in all the patients, and hepatic iron concentration (HIC) was determined in 97 of them (26 women, 71 men). C282Y and H63D mutations were sought in all the subjects by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction assay. The frequency of HFE genotypes and alleles did not differ in patients and controls. No relation was detected between hepatic iron stores and HFE gene mutations in women. In men, all C282Y heterozygotes had iron overload, and the H63D mutation was significantly more frequent in patients with more marked hepatic siderosis than in those with mild or no siderosis (P = .0039) and in controls (P = .0008). Heavy alcohol intake and hepatic cirrhosis were also associated with increased hepatic iron stores in the men. In the 71 men in whom HIC was measured, multiple regression analysis showed that this variable was related independently only to alcohol intake and HFE gene mutations. We suggest that in patients with CH, iron accumulates in the liver as the result of an interplay between genetic and acquired factors, and that increased liver iron stores may influence progression toward liver fibrosis.	9755249
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis in Ireland and HFE.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	1998	0.5	Sixty patients diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis with grade 3 or 4 hepatic iron overload and 18 patients diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis who had less than grade 3 hepatic iron overload were examined for the HFE gene mutations, 845A (C282Y) and 187G (H63D). Control samples were obtained from 109 randomly selected individuals. Fifty-six of 60 unrelated hereditary hemochromatosis patients (93%) with grade 3 or 4 hepatic iron deposition were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Fourteen of the 18 hereditary hemochromatosis patients with <3+ iron deposition (76%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Three of 8 patients who were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation were also heterozygous for the H63D mutation. Thirty-one of 109 control individuals were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation and 27 were heterozygous for the H63D mutation. Our finding that 93% of hereditary hemochromatosis patients who fulfil standard diagnostic criteria are homozygous for the C282Y mutation provides clear evidence that this mutation is strongly associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. The allele frequency of 14% for the C282Y mutation in our control population is the highest reported and supports the hypothesis of a Celtic origin for the hereditary hemochromatosis gene.	9851896
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Celtic origin of the C282Y mutation of hemochromatosis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	1998	0.5	The C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is the main mutation causing hemochromatosis, and C282Y frequencies have been reported for various European populations. The aim of this review is to compile the Y allele frequencies of the C282Y mutation for twenty European populations. The most elevated value (6.88%) is observed in residual Celtic populations in UK and France, in accordance to the hypothesis of Simon et al. concerning a Celtic origin of the hereditary hemochromatosis mutation.	9851897
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis and in control subjects from Northern Germany.	British journal of haematology	1998	5.4	Mutation analysis was performed for two HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D) in unrelated patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (n = 92), family members of patients (n = 34), and unrelated controls (n = 157) from Northern Germany, 87/92 patients (94.6%) revealed the C282Y mutation in homozygous form, five were heterozygous. No H63D mutation was found in 174 chromosomes of patients homozygous for C282Y, whereas four of the heterozygote patients also carried the H63D mutation. Among the control group, 9.6% were heterozygotes for C282Y. 2/157 subjects were homozygous, 37/157 were heterozygous for the H63D mutation, but showed no signs of iron overload.	9858243
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Polymorphisms in the HFE gene.	Human heredity	1999	1.54	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive iron overload. Recently, a candidate gene named HFE was isolated on the short arm of the chromosome 6 within which two mutations were identified: C282Y and H63D. To date, only homozygosity for the C282Y mutation is considered as a diagnostic criterion of hemochromatosis. 7.6% of the patients studied in our laboratory did not carry two copies of the C282Y mutation. On the other hand, a dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome has recently been described and the search for the C282Y and H63D mutations revealed that none of the patients was homozygous for C282Y while 67% exhibited one of the mutations. The possibility of a new mutation in the HFE gene has been raised to explain the disease in the remaining patients, as well as, in the few hemochromatotic patients without two copies of the C282Y mutation. The aim of this study was to search for new mutations in the HFE gene in 16 such patients. Direct sequencing of exons and 3 introns did not reveal any new mutation but identified a few polymorphisms.	9858853
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The relation of iron status and hemochromatosis gene mutations in patients with chronic hepatitis C.	Gastroenterology	1999	18.19	Elevated hepatic iron concentration may affect the response to antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis C. This study explored the contribution of genetic hemochromatosis to iron accumulation in chronic hepatitis C. HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) were assessed in 184 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus and 487 controls. Liver biopsy specimens were available in 149 patients. Hepatic iron content was measured in 114 patients by atom-absorption spectrophotometry. The C282Y and H63D allele frequencies were 7.06 and 11.6 in patients and 4.83 and 11.09 in controls, respectively. Eight patients were homozygotes (5 C282Y [2.7%] and 3 H63D [1.6%]), 2 compound heterozygotes (1%), and 49 heterozygotes (14 C282Y [7.6%] and 35 H63D [19%]). Biochemical evidence of iron overload was more common in patients with HFE mutations (28 of 47) than in those without (34 of 102; P = 0.0045). Histological iron grading and hepatic iron content overlapped among patients with or without mutations. A hepatic iron index of >1.9 was observed only in 1 of the 4 C282Y homozygotes and 1 of the 3 H63D homozygotes. HFE mutations contribute to but do not fully explain hepatic iron accumulation in chronic hepatitis C. Furthermore, C282Y or H63D homozygosity in chronic hepatitis C is not necessarily associated with a high hepatic iron content.	9869610
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis in liver transplantation.	Liver transplantation and surgery : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society	1999	0.5	A candidate gene, HFE, was recently described in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and found to contain a missense mutation leading to a cysteine to tyrosine substitution (C282Y). A second mutation, H63D, was also found in the gene. This study was undertaken to determine the HFE genotype in liver transplant recipients clinically diagnosed with HH and those incidentally found to have increased iron deposition in their explanted livers and to evaluate whether biochemical or histological hepatic iron indices (HIIs) correlated with homozygosity for the C282Y mutation. We identified 15 patients clinically diagnosed with various liver disorders other than HH who had increased liver iron deposits among 918 adult patients who underwent liver transplantation from 1988 to 1995. Four additional patients were clinically diagnosed as having HH. Archival explant liver tissue was evaluated for the histological HII according to the method of Deugnier et al, in which an index greater than 0.15 suggests homozygosity for HH. The HII was computed according to established methods, with a value greater than 1.9 suggesting homozygosity for HH. A portion of liver tissue was subjected to DNA genotyping using polymerase chain reaction-amplified products. Two of 4 patients with clinically suspected HH were homozygous for C282Y, and 2 patients had neither mutation. One of the 15 patients not suspected to have HH was a C282Y homozygote, 1 was a C282Y heterozygote, 6 were H63D heterozygotes, and 7 had neither mutation. The histological HII was consistent with HH in 13 patients, whereas the HII was consistent with HH in 6 patients. Thus, in patients with end-stage liver disease, despite fulfilling the established clinical criteria for HH using biochemical and histological parameters, only a minority of patients were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Hepatic iron overload may result from other causes, and in end-stage liver disease, an elevated HII may not accurately predict HH. Other factors that either control or lead to iron absorption may explain iron overload in these patients.	9873093
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Phenotypic expression of the C282Y/Q283P compound heterozygosity in HFE and molecular modeling of the Q283P mutation effect.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	In Caucasians, from 4 to 35% of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) patients carry a least one chromosome without a common assigned HFE mutation (i.e., C282Y, H63D, and S65C). We have undertaken a D-HPLC scanning of the HFE coding region in such patients in order to identify uncommon mutations liable to explain their high transferrin saturation level. Twenty HH patients from Brittany carrying at least one chromosome without an assigned mutation were selected on the basis of a transferrin saturation level with the following threshold: > or = 60% in men and > or = 50% in women, in the absence of other known causes of iron disorders. This strategy allowed us to detect a heterozygous sequence variant in exon 4 of the HFE gene from one individual who was also heterozygous for C282Y. Subsequent DNA sequencing analysis identified an adenine to cytosine transversion at position 848 which changes amino acid 283 from glutamine to proline (Q283P). Family study revealed a clear association between the C282Y/Q283P compound heterozygote genotype and the development of HH. Molecular modeling studies are in favor of a destabilizing effect of the Q283P mutation on the tertiary structure of the HFE protein. This is the first report of a natural protein variant describing the introduction of a proline in a central beta-strand position. Our approach may have practical implications in screening strategies for hereditary hemochromatosis, molecular diagnosis, and HFE structure-function relationships.	12737937
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of HFE genes C282Y, H63D, and S65D in patients with hyperferritinemia from northeastern Brazil.	Journal of clinical laboratory analysis	2014	1.55	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic disease caused by the high absorption and deposition of iron in several organs. This accumulation results in several clinical complications such as cirrhosis, arthritis, cardiopathies, diabetes, sexual disorders, and skin darkening. The H63D and C282Y mutations are well defined in the HH etiology. The objective of this article is identification of the H63D and C282Y mutations in the HFE protein gene and the frequency assessment of these mutations in patients with persistent increase of serum ferritin in patients from Natal City from state of Rio Grande do Norte, located in northeastern Brazil. Of the 299 patients studied for C282Y and H63D, 48.49% showed absence of mutation and 51.51% showed some sort of mutation: heterozygous C282Y mutation in 4.35% patients, homozygous C282Y mutation in 2.67% patients, heterozygous H63D mutation in 31.44% patients, homozygous H63D mutation in 8.03% patients, and heterozygous for the mutation in both genes (C282Y/H63D) in 5.02% patients. The S65C mutation was studied in 112 patients and heterozygous mutation (S65D/WT) in 2.67% of patients and double mutation (H63D/S65C) in 1.78% of patients were observed. Due to the high prevalence of hemochromatosis, its genetic diagnosis has become a challenge, especially in the high-risk group.	24395214
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Age-dependent ferritin elevations and HFE C282Y mutation as risk factors for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis in males: a longitudinal cohort study.	BMC musculoskeletal disorders	2014	1.68	Age, gender and genetic predisposition are major intrinsic risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA). Iron increases are associated with age and gene mutation. In the present study, we examined whether serum ferritin, an indicator of total body iron stores, correlates with clinical features in patients with OA, and whether the hemochromatosis Fe (HFE) gene mutation plays a role. In a 2-year longitudinal observational study, 127 patients with knee OA and 20 healthy individuals (controls) were enrolled. All patients underwent standardized weight-bearing fixed-flexion posteroanterior knee radiographs. Peripheral blood samples were analyzed for serum ferritin, and genotyped for HFE using allelic discrimination methods. Higher levels of serum ferritin were found in patients older than 56 years (P =0.0186) and males (P =0.0006), with a trend toward higher ferritin in patients with OA. HFE gene mutation carriers were more prevalent among patients with OA than among healthy controls. When stratified further by gender, we found that male patients with OA had higher levels of serum ferritin than male control subjects [odds ratio = 4.18 (limits of 95% confidence interval: 0.86-27.69, P = 0.048)]. Analyses of radiographic data indicated that higher ferritin was associated with narrower joint space width at baseline (P = 0.032) in male patients. Additionally, among men, risk prediction of radiographic severity [Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade >2)] in the higher ferritin group was almost five times that of the lower ferritin group (odds ratio = 4.74, P = 0.023). Our data suggest that increased ferritin levels are associated with symptomatic knee OA in males. This finding needs to be validated in a larger cohort of patients.	24401005
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Regional differences of HFE (C282Y, H63D) allele frequencies in the Netherlands A model case illustrating the significance of genographics and prehistorical population migration.	Acta clinica Belgica		0.68	We investigated HFE C282Y and H63D allele frequencies in three Dutch towns in the Netherlands, as well as their association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Study subjects were selected from participants of the Monitoring Project on Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in the Netherlands carried out in Amsterdam, Doetinchem and Maastricht among > 35000 subjects, 20-59 years of age. Mortality follow-up lasted 9 to 13 years. A random sample of the cohort (n = 1075) provided information on the total study population. The random sample and all CVD deaths (n = 301) were genotyped for the C282Y and H63D mutation. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for CVD mortality were calculated per genotype. C282Y allele frequencies differed significantly between the towns investigated (p = 0.017), whereas the allele frequencies of H63D were similar (p = 0.141) across towns. In Maastricht we found a C282Y allele frequency of 0.086 compared to 0.055 in Amsterdam and 0.054 in Doetinchem. C282Y and H63D heterozygosity did not predict fatal CVD in either men or women, whereas homozygosity for the H63D mutation increased fatal CVD in women (adjusted HR = 8.5; 95% CI = 2.3-31.1). The unexpected high C282Y allele frequency in Maastricht is in line with the recent evidence of a Celtic origin of citizens from the former southern Netherlands and with prehistorical population migrations revealed in the context of the international Genographic Project, a landmark study of prehistorical human migrations around the globe. We recommend that when designing national screening programmes and national registries for genetic disorders, potential regional prevalence differences should be taken into account.	23340149
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: implications for South Dakota physicians.	South Dakota medicine : the journal of the South Dakota State Medical Association	2013	0.5	Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) still causes debate among health professionals regarding appropriateness of diagnostic and screening tools. The Hemochromatosis gene (HFE) was discovered in 1996 and is now recognized to cause the majority of HH cases. A C282Y missense mutation in the HFE gene causes up to 90 percent of HH cases. In northern European populations, prevalence of heterozygosity is estimated to be as high as 10 percent, with symptomatic iron overload developing in as many as one in 200 to 300. Many guidelines regarding population screening have been proposed. It is especially important to strike a balance between allocation of healthcare resources and patient well-being in areas such as South Dakota with a large northern European and high proportion of Medicare and Medicaid patient population. This article outlines a reasonable approach to diagnosis and management for primary care physicians in South Dakota centered on a prototypical case review.	23342715
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Elevated MCP-1 serum levels are associated with the H63D mutation and not the C282Y mutation in hereditary hemochromatosis.	Tissue antigens	2007	2.05	Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a major lymphocyte and inflammatory chemokine associated with persistent inflammatory states. Several abnormalities in the immune status of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) have been reported, suggesting an imbalance in their immune function. This may include persistent production of, or exposure to, inflammatory cytokines contributing to the pathogenesis of this disorder. The aim of this study was to assess MCP-1 levels in patients with HH and correlate these results with HFE status and iron indexes. One hundred and thirty-nine subjects diagnosed with HH (C282Y homozygotes = 87, C282Y/H63D = 26 heterozygotes, H63D homozygotes = 26), 27 healthy control subjects with no HFE mutation (N/N), and 18 normal subjects heterozygous for the H63D mutation served as age- and sex-matched controls. Ferritin and transferrin saturation and the presence of HFE mutation status were correlated with MCP-1 levels. Full white blood cell count analysis was also performed. We found a strongly significant decrease in MCP-1 protein levels in the C282Y homozygotes compared with the H63D homozygotes (P = 0.0009) and C282Y/H63D heterozygotes (P = 0.002). Similarly, MCP-1 protein levels in the C282Y homozygotes were decreased compared with the healthy controls (P = 0.00076). Furthermore, MCP-1 serum levels were elevated in H63D patients compared with the healthy controls (P = 0.0008). This study suggests for the first time that a differential expression of MCP-1 protein in patients with HH is associated with the specific HFE genetic component for iron overload. Therefore, these findings offer a possible explanation in the variable clinical spectrum of pathogenesis in patients with HH through abnormalities of an imbalance in the immune states of patients with HH.	17767550
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The role of hemochromatosis susceptibility gene mutations in protecting against iron deficiency in celiac disease.	Gastroenterology	2002	18.19	Celiac disease and hereditary hemochromatosis are common HLA-defined conditions in northwestern Europe. We sought to determine whether there is a genetic relationship between the 2 diseases and if hemochromatosis susceptibility gene (HFE) mutations are protective against iron deficiency in celiac disease. Polymerase chain reaction amplification using sequence-specific primers capable of identifying the 2 HFE gene mutations (H63D and C282Y) and the HLA class I and II alleles was used to type 145 white patients with celiac disease and 187 matched controls. Hemoglobin and fasting serum iron levels in celiac patients were measured at diagnosis. HFE gene mutations, H63D or C282Y, were identified in 70 celiac patients (48.3%) and 61 controls (32.6%) (P = 0.004). The C282Y mutation was associated with HLA-A*03 and B*07 alleles in controls and with A*01, A*03, B*08, and DRB1*0301 alleles in celiac patients; the H63D mutation was associated with HLA-A*25 and DRB1*03 alleles in controls and A*29 and DRB1*03 alleles in celiac patients. At diagnosis, celiac patients with the C282Y mutation had higher mean hemoglobin and fasting serum iron levels compared with the HFE wild type (P = 0.0002 and 0.006, respectively). This was not observed with the H63D mutation. In celiac disease, HFE gene mutations are common and are in linkage disequilibrium with different HLA alleles compared with controls. A disease-specific haplotype that carries C282Y and DQB1*02 is suggested. We propose that HFE gene mutations provide a survival advantage by ameliorating the iron deficiency seen in celiac patients.	12145797
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Relations among serum ferritin, C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Czech population.	Experimental and clinical endocrinology & diabetes : official journal, German Society of Endocrinology [and] German Diabetes Association	2002	1.66	Aims of the study were: (i) to determine the prevalence of mutations C282Y and H63D in the HFE gene causing hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and non-diabetics, (ii) to investigate the relationship among HFE genotypes, serum ferritin and glucose intolerance and (iii) to assess possible association of HFE mutations with the susceptibility to develop late diabetic complications in the Czech population. Two approaches were employed - the case-control study comprising diabetics and non-diabetic controls (n = 326) and the cross-sectional study comprising subjects with a previously unknown defect of glucose tolerance (n = 113, oral glucose tolerance test performed in each subject). Allele frequencies of C282Y and H63D did not differ between diabetic and control groups nor among subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes. Ferritin levels significantly differed between diabetic and non-diabetic women (P<1.10 (-3)) and among subjects with NGT, IGT and diabetes (P<0.05). Differences in ferritin levels related to particular genotypes of C282Y and H63D were not detected. Prevalence of diabetes in the first and second quartiles of ferritin distribution differed highly significantly from the prevalence in the third and fourth quartiles in women (P = 0.000037), OR = 3.50 (95% CI, 1.89-6.48). The extent of diabetic late complications did not correlate with ferritin plasma levels.	12148086
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Regulation of iron absorption in Hfe mutant mice.	Blood	2002	11.84	Hereditary hemochromatosis is most commonly caused by homozygosity for a point mutation (C282Y) in the human hemochromatosis gene (HFE). The mechanism by which HFE regulates iron absorption is not known, but the C282Y mutation results in loss of cell surface expression of the human hemachromatosis protein (HFE) and hyperabsorption of iron by the duodenal enterocyte. Mice homozygous for a deletion in the mouse hemochromatosis gene (Hfe) or a mutation equivalent to that seen in human hereditary hemochromatosis (C282Y) were compared with wild-type animals for their ability to regulate iron absorption. Both mutant strains hyperabsorbed (59)Fe administered by gavage. Feeding a diet supplemented with carbonyl iron resulted in a more than 5-fold reduction of (59)Fe absorption in both wild-type and mutant mouse strains. Similarly, the iron loading associated with age in Hfe mutant mice resulted in nearly a 4-fold reduction in iron absorption. When mice were stimulated to absorb iron either by depleting iron stores or by inducing erythropoiesis, wild type and Hfe mutant strains increased absorption to similar levels, approximately 5-fold over control values. Our data indicate that Hfe mutant mice retain the ability to regulate iron absorption. Mouse hemachromatosis protein (Hfe) plays a minor role in down-regulation but does not influence the up-regulation of iron absorption.	12149232
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Noniatrogenic haemochromatosis in congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type II is not related to C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene: report on two brothers.	Acta clinica Belgica		0.68	The discovery of the gene responsible for most cases of hereditary haemochromatosis has made it possible to evaluate the role of this gene in iron accumulation in other conditions. Previous observations in patients with various inherited anaemias are suggestive of a role of the haemochromatosis gene in the noniatrogenic form of iron overload that may occur in these conditions. We studied two brothers with congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type II, presenting with marked noniatrogenic iron overload. Young age, familial occurrence, concordance of iron overload, and histology were all suggestive of a genetic basis for the iron overload. A search for C282Y, H63D, S65C, and IVS3 + 1G?T mutations was performed by polymerase chain reaction after extraction of genomic DNA from whole blood. A search for the C282Y, H63D, S65C, and IVS3 + 1G?T mutations in the HFE gene proved to be negative. Despite the existence of ineffective erythropoiesis with mild anaemia, both patients were treated with regular phlebotomies in order to prevent long-term complications of their iron-overload. This treatment was well tolerated. 1. C282Y, H63D, S65C, and IVS3 + 1G?T mutations were negative in two brothers with congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia, in whom young age, familial occurrence, concordance of iron overload, and the histological pattern were all suggestive of hereditary haemochromatosis. 2. Treatment with regular phlebotomies, in order to prevent complications of iron overload, was well tolerated despite the existence of mild haemolytic anaemia.	12152243
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hereditary hemochromatosis].	Revista de gastroenterologia del Peru : organo oficial de la Sociedad de Gastroenterologia del Peru		0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an inherited autosomal recessive disease, associated to a mutation in the recently described HFE gene, which is located on the short arm of chromosome 6. The product of this gene combines with the beta-2-microglobulin and the ferritin receptor, and regulates the iron absorption in the small intestine crypt cells. It is possible that the mutation may cause the increased iron uptake by the intestinal cells. The disease is very much common in men after the forties, and its expression is influenced by concomitant alcoholism, iron rich diet, oral and parenteral iron administration, menstrual blood loss or abnormal hemorrhages, blood donations, pregnancy, lactation, and iron malabsorption clinical conditions, like celiac disease. Many patients are asymptomatic, and the diagnosis may be suspected by hepatomegaly of unknown cause, abnormal iron metabolism tests, increased serum aminotransferase levels, diabetes mellitus, and anonymous arthropathy. Less commonly hereditary hemochromatosis presented by symptoms and signs of chronic liver disease, or by the classic triad described by Trousseau skin pigmentation, hepatomegaly and diabetes mellitus. The diagnosis is confirmed by the increased serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation, and the stainable iron in hepatocytes, measured by scale devised by Scheuer et al, or the measurement of the hepatic iron. The C282Y mutation was found in 64 to 100% of patients; eventually, subjects with hepatic iron overload identical to hereditary hemochromatosis has no mutation, and homozygous for the C282Y mutation do not express iron overload. Iron is best and quickly removed by weekly or twice-weekly phlebotomy of 500 ml, containing approximately 250 mg iron. One to 3 years of weekly phlebotomy may be required to reduce stores to normal. As a guide to long-term maintenance therapy, is recommended phlebotomy every 3 months and the serum ferritin level should be maintained by less than 50 ng/ml.	12170286
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Phenotype and HFE genotype in a population with abnormal iron markers recruited from an Endocrinology Department.	European journal of endocrinology	2006	3.89	The aim of this study was to describe HFE genotype in a population of patients with altered iron markers recruited in an Endocrinology Department and to define the possible phenotype-genotype relationships. A total of 156 patients with high serum ferritin concentrations (>300 ng/ml) or transferrin saturation (>45%) (I group), and a control group of 106 healthy subjects (C group) underwent HFE genotyping (classical C282Y and H63D mutations). We also examined the main genetic features of subgroups in I according to the presence (D) or the absence (ND) of diabetes. (1) The genotypes were significantly different in the I and C groups (P<0.001), with an increased frequency of major 282Y allele in the I group (35% vs 7.5%), but not of minor 63D allele (17 vs 18.5%). (2) The genotype of D and ND groups also differed (P<0.0001), with a lower frequency of C282 heterozygosity (P<0.0001) in the D group, and a higher prevalence of H63D heterozygosity in the D vs ND groups (P<0.01). (3) The phenotypic comparison of D and ND groups also showed a higher mean body mass index, age, and serum ferritin concentration, as well as an increased proportion of males with increased liver enzymes in the D group. This population harboring abnormal iron markers had a different HFE genotype and a higher 282Y allele frequency than the control population. This suggests that blood iron markers could be checked in etiological investigations of metabolic disturbances to identify patients who should undergo genotyping, since approximately 20% were diagnosed with C282Y homozygosity.	16728543
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Liver transplantation normalizes serum hepcidin level and cures iron metabolism alterations in HFE hemochromatosis.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2014	0.5	Defects in human hemochromatosis protein (HFE) cause iron overload due to reduced hepatic hepcidin secretion. Liver transplantation (LT) is a key treatment for potential complications from HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). This study evaluated hepcidin secretion and iron burden after LT to elucidate HH pathophysiology. Patients (n=18) homozygous for the p.Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene underwent LT between 1999 and 2008. Serum iron, serum hepcidin, and hepatic iron concentrations were determined before LT and at the end of follow-up (median 57 months). Mortality and causes of death were determined. Survival was compared to that of the overall patient population that received LT. Before LT, serum hepcidin levels were low (0.54 ± 2.5 nmol/L; normal range: 4-30 nmol/L). After LT, 11 patients had iron evaluations; none received iron depletion therapy; all had normal transferrin saturation. The mean serum ferritin was 185 (± 99) μg/L. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that iron overload was absent in nine patients, mild in one patient with metabolic syndrome, and high (180 μmol/g) in one patient with hereditary spherocytosis discovered after LT. At the end of follow-up, serum hepcidin was normal in 10 patients (11.12 ± 7.6 nmol/L; P<0.05) and low in one patient with iron deficiency anemia. Survival was 83% and 67% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Survival was similar for patients with HH and patients that received LT for other causes. In HH, LT normalized hepcidin secretion and prevented recurrence of hepatic iron overload. Survival was similar to that of patients who received LTs for other liver diseases.	23775519
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	High-performance liquid chromatography multiplex detection of two single nucleotide mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis.	Journal of chromatography. B, Biomedical sciences and applications	2001	0.5	High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been applied to the multiplex detection of the two single nucleotide mutations commonly found in hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). HH is associated with a major G to A transition at position 845 (mutation Cys282Tyr) and a minor C to G transition at position 187 (mutation His63Asp) in the cDNA of the HFE gene. Two detection assays were developed based on HPLC analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or single nucleotide extension (SNE) products following multiplex PCR amplification. RFLP genotypes the two sites as dsDNA fragments of different lengths generated by restriction enzymes Rsa I/Bcl I. SNE extends primers 5'-adjacent to the sites of interest with a dideoxynucleotide triphosphate (ddNTP) to generate extended ssDNA. The identity of the added ddNTP reveals the identity of the original possible mutation site(s). Application of these methods with HPLC analysis provides simple and reliable genotyping for HH and can be applied to other single nucleotide polymorphism studies.	11318424
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of C282Y and H63D mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene in the United States.	JAMA	2001	0.5	Population-based estimates of the prevalence of disease-associated mutations, such as hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations, are needed to determine the usefulness of genetic screening. To estimate the prevalence of the HFE mutations C282Y and H63D in the US population. Cross-sectional population-based study of samples in the DNA bank from phase 2 of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 1992 to 1994. Genotyped samples of cells from a total of 5171 participants, cross-classified by sex, age, and race/ethnicity in the analysis. Estimates of the prevalence of C282Y and H63D mutations. The prevalence of C282Y homozygosity is estimated to be 0.26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12%-0.49%); 1.89% (95% CI, 1.48%-2.43%) for H63D homozygosity; and 1.97% (95% CI, 1.54%-2.49%) for compound heterozygosity. The prevalence estimates for C282Y heterozygosity (C282Y/wild type) are 9.54% among non-Hispanic whites, 2.33% among non-Hispanic blacks, and 2.75% among Mexican-Americans. The prevalence estimates of the C282Y mutation in the US population are 5.4% (95% CI, 4.7%-6.2%) and 13.5% (95% CI, 12.5%-14.8%) for the H63D mutation. Estimates of prevalence of HFE mutations are within the expected range for non-Hispanic whites and blacks but the estimated prevalence of the C282Y mutation among Mexican-Americans is less than expected. Mutation data now need to be linked to clinically relevant indices, such as transferrin saturation level.	11325323
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene variants in three different ethnic populations: effects of admixture for screening programs.	Human biology	2001	0.86	Genetic testing for hemochromatosis may have important implications for diagnosis and screening of the disease. However, the relative importance of mutations in the gene for hereditary hemochromatosis, HFE, may vary among populations, when the mutant allele frequencies and their penetrance in a particular genetic and environmental background are taken into account. We present data on the allele and genotype frequencies and population structure of two HFE genetic variants in three different ethnic groups from a highly mixed urban population (São Paulo, Brazil). Allele frequencies for both the C282Y and H63D HFE mutations showed significant differences among the studied populations (for the C282Y mutation, Euro-Brazilian 3.7%, admixed 0.7%, Afro-Brazilian 0.5%; and for the H63D mutation, Euro-Brazilian 20.3%, admixed 13.0%, Afro-Brazilian 6.4). The data substantiate a European origin for these mutations. Furthermore, they provide a basis for a more rational strategic planning of population screening programs for the disease.	11332643
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Diagnosis of hemochromatosis in family members of probands: a comparison of phenotyping and HFE genotyping.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics		7.71	We wanted to compare phenotyping and HFE genotyping for diagnosis of hemochromatosis in 150 family members of 61 probands. Phenotypes were defined by persistent transferrin saturation elevation, iron overload, or both; genotypes were defined by HFE mutation analysis. Twenty-five family members were C282Y homozygotes; 23 of these (92%) had a hemochromatosis phenotype. Twenty-three family members had HFE genotype C282Y/H63D; eight of these (35%) had a hemochromatosis phenotype. Six of 102 (6%) family members who inherited other HFE genotypes had a hemochromatosis phenotype. Phenotyping and genotyping are complementary in diagnosing hemochromatosis among family members of probands.	11336458
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The effects of wild-type and mutant HFE expression upon cellular iron uptake in transfected human embryonic kidney cells.	Biochimica et biophysica acta	2001	0.5	In order to measure the effects of HFE (haemochromatosis) upon iron uptake, stable expression of wild-type and C282Y, H63D and S65C mutant HFE cDNA was established in HEK 293 cells. Control cells were transfected with empty vector. Expression of HFE mRNA and protein was detected in the cell lines transfected with HFE cDNA, but not in the control cell line. The ferritin concentration in wild-type cells cultured in 40 microM ferric ammonium citrate was 69% of that in control cells and 81% of that in C282Y cells. The ferritin concentration in H63D cells was intermediate between wild-type and C282Y and the ferritin concentration in S65C cells was similar to wild-type cells. Uptake of transferrin-iron in wild-type, C282Y and control cells was measured over 45 min. The Hill coefficients for transferrin-iron uptake were similar. The V(max) for transferrin-iron uptake in wild-type cells was 59.5% of control cells and 69.5% of C282Y cells. Estimates of K(m) were 232 nM for wild-type cells, 338 nM for C282Y cells and 570 nM for controls. Transferrin receptor levels were lowered, but not significantly, in the HFE transfected cells. The results show that HFE reduces transferrin-iron uptake, probably as an uncompetitive inhibitor.	11336795
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Evaluation of genome-wide loci of iron metabolism in hereditary hemochromatosis identifies PCSK7 as a host risk factor of liver cirrhosis.	Human molecular genetics	2014	5.99	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed genetic determinants of iron metabolism, but correlation of these with clinical phenotypes is pending. Homozygosity for HFE C282Y is the predominant genetic risk factor for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and may cause liver cirrhosis. However, this genotype has a low penetrance. Thus, detection of yet unknown genetic markers that identify patients at risk of developing severe liver disease is necessary for better prevention. Genetic loci associated with iron metabolism (TF, TMPRSS6, PCSK7, TFR2 and Chr2p14) in recent GWAS and liver fibrosis (PNPLA3) in recent meta-analysis were analyzed for association with either liver cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis in 148 German HFE C282Y homozygotes. Replication of associations was sought in additional 499 Austrian/Swiss and 112 HFE C282Y homozygotes from Sweden. Only variant rs236918 in the PCSK7 gene (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7) was associated with cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis (P = 1.02 × 10(-5)) in the German cohort with genotypic odds ratios of 3.56 (95% CI 1.29-9.77) for CG heterozygotes and 5.38 (95% CI 2.39-12.10) for C allele carriers. Association between rs236918 and cirrhosis was confirmed in Austrian/Swiss HFE C282Y homozygotes (P = 0.014; ORallelic = 1.82 (95% CI 1.12-2.95) but not in Swedish patients. Post hoc combined analyses of German/Swiss/Austrian patients with available liver histology (N = 244, P = 0.00014, ORallelic = 2.84) and of males only (N = 431, P = 2.17 × 10(-5), ORallelic = 2.54) were consistent with the premier finding. Association between rs236918 and cirrhosis was not confirmed in alcoholic cirrhotics, suggesting specificity of this genetic risk factor for HH. PCSK7 variant rs236918 is a risk factor for cirrhosis in HH patients homozygous for the HFE C282Y mutation.	24556216
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis: overview of genetics and clinical implications for nurse practitioners in primary care settings.	Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners	2014	1.27	HFE-hemochromatosis is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States among Caucasians of Northern European ancestry. The purpose of this article is to discuss HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), including the genetics, pathophysiology, phenotype and genotype, diagnostics, and management utilizing a case-based format as an exemplar. Online genetic resources; professional guidelines; review; and scientific articles. HFE-HH is an autosomal recessive disorder and two major genes C282Y and H63D are associated with HH (iron overload) susceptibility particularly C282Y/C282Y mutations. It has a variable penetrance and expression. Individuals who develop iron overload may develop broad symptoms, including joint discomfort, fatigue, decreased libido, and abdominal pain; and if left untreated, HFE-HH has the potential of developing end-organ disease including liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer; cardiac arrhythmias or heart failure; and diabetes. Suspicion of the disorder begins with personal and family history, transferrin saturation, and ferritin levels, and if high, genotyping to confirm the disorder. Management consists of correcting iron overload to prevent/delay end-organ damage often consisting of intermittent phlebotomy. Knowledge of HFE-HH is essential so that nurse practitioners can identify individuals at risk and to provide appropriate management of care and referral.	24574363
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between inherited monogenic liver disorders and chronic hepatitis C.	World journal of hepatology	2014	0.5	To determine the frequencies of mutations that cause inherited monogenic liver disorders in patients with chronic hepatitis C. This study included 86 patients with chronic hepatitis C (55 men, 31 women; mean age at diagnosis, 38.36 ± 14.52 years) who had undergone antiviral therapy comprising pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Viral load, biochemical parameter changes, and liver biopsy morphological data were evaluated in all patients. The control group comprised 271 unrelated individuals representing the general population of Latvia for mutation frequency calculations. The most frequent mutations that cause inherited liver disorders [gene (mutation): ATP7B (H1069Q), HFE (C282Y, H63D), UGT1A1 (TA)7, and SERPINA1 (PiZ)] were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), bidirectional PCR allele-specific amplification, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and sequencing. The viral genotype was detected in 80 of the 86 patients. Viral genotypes 1, 2, and 3 were present in 61 (76%), 7 (9%), and 12 (15%) patients, respectively. Among all 86 patients, 50 (58%) reached an early viral response and 70 (81%) reached a sustained viral response. All 16 patients who did not reach a sustained viral response had viral genotype 1. Case-control analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in only the H1069Q mutation between patients and controls (patients, 0.057; controls, 0.012; odds ratio, 5.514; 95%CI: 1.119-29.827, P = 0.022). However, the H1069Q mutation was not associated with antiviral treatment outcomes or biochemical indices. The (TA) 7 mutation of the UGT1A1 gene was associated with decreased ferritin levels (beta regression coefficient = -295.7, P = 0.0087). Genetic mutations that cause inherited liver diseases in patients with hepatitis C should be studied in detail.	24575168
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Polymorphisms in the genes coding for iron binding and transporting proteins are associated with disability, severity, and early progression in multiple sclerosis.	BMC medical genetics	2012	2.09	Iron involvement/imbalance is strongly suspected in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiopathogenesis, but its role is quite debated. Iron deposits encircle the veins in brain MS lesions, increasing local metal concentrations in brain parenchyma as documented by magnetic resonance imaging and histochemical studies. Conversely, systemic iron overload is not always observed. We explored the role of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the main iron homeostasis genes in MS patients. By the pyrosequencing technique, we investigated 414 MS cases [Relapsing-remitting (RR), n=273; Progressive, n=141, of which: Secondary (SP), n=103 and Primary (PP), n=38], and 414 matched healthy controls. Five SNPs in 4 genes were assessed: hemochromatosis (HFE: C282Y, H63D), ferroportin (FPN1: -8CG), hepcidin (HEPC: -582AG), and transferrin (TF: P570S). The FPN1-8GG genotype was overrepresented in the whole MS population (OR=4.38; 95%CI, 1.89-10.1; P<0.0001) and a similar risk was found among patients with progressive forms. Conversely, the HEPC -582GG genotype was overrepresented only in progressive forms (OR=2.53; 95%CI, 1.34-4.78; P=0.006) so that SP and PP versus RR yielded significant outputs (P=0.009). For almost all SNPs, MS disability score (EDSS), severity score (MSSS), as well as progression index (PI) showed a significant increase when comparing homozygotes versus individuals carrying other genotypes: HEPC -582GG (EDSS, 4.24±2.87 vs 2.78±2.1; P=0.003; MSSS, 5.6±3.06 vs 3.79±2.6; P=0.001); FPN1-8GG (PI, 1.11±2.01 vs 0.6±1.31; P=0.01; MSSS, 5.08±2.98 vs 3.85±2.8; P=0.01); HFE 63DD (PI, 1.63±2.6 vs 0.6±0.86; P=0.009). Finally, HEPC -582G-carriers had a significantly higher chance to switch into the progressive form (HR=3.55; 1.83-6.84; log-rank P=0.00006). Polymorphisms in the genes coding for iron binding and transporting proteins, in the presence of local iron overload, might be responsible for suboptimal iron handling. This might account for the significant variability peculiar to MS phenotypes, particularly affecting MS risk and progression paving the way for personalized pharmacogenetic applications in the clinical practice.	22883388
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effect of the A736V TMPRSS6 polymorphism on the penetrance and clinical expression of hereditary hemochromatosis.	Journal of hepatology	2012	10.59	"""Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is most frequently related to homozygosity for the p.C282Y HFE mutation (C282Y(+/+)), hampering hepcidin induction in response to iron. The rs855791 polymorphism, encoding for the p.A736V variant of TMPRSS6 regulating hepcidin, influences iron status in the population. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of rs855791 on the penetrance and clinical expression of HH. We retrospectively considered 315 HH patients (163 C282Y(+/+), and 152 with other HFE genotypes) evaluated at the time of diagnosis, and 271 healthy controls with normal iron parameters, residents of Northern Italy; TMPRSS6 genotype was assessed by allele specific polymerase chain reaction. The p.736V variant determining higher hepcidin release was under-represented in the patients (p=0.0023), independently of the presence of the C282Y(+/+) genotype, and the p.736V/V genotype protected from HH independently of age and sex (OR of HH for p.736A/A: 2.57, 1.3-4.1 and for p.736A/V: 1.84, 1.1-3.2). In the 96 C282Y(+/+) male patients without chronic viral hepatitis and alcohol abuse, the """"high hepcidin"""" p.736V allele was negatively associated with cirrhosis independently of age, ferritin, ALT levels, and alcohol intake (OR 3.93, 95% C.I. 1.17-14.61 for the p.736A variant), and with the cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (17% p.736A/A, 4% p.736A/V, 0 p.736V/V, p=0.05). The p.A736V TMPRSS6 polymorphism is likely a modifier of HH expression. Additional studies are warranted to validate these findings in other cohorts and test their potential relevance for the clinical management of HH patients."""	22885719
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations in the HFE, TFR2, and SLC40A1 genes in patients with hemochromatosis.	Gene	2012	2.32	Hereditary hemochromatosis causes iron overload and is associated with a variety of genetic and phenotypic conditions. Early diagnosis is important so that effective treatment can be administered and the risk of tissue damage avoided. Most patients are homozygous for the c.845G>A (p.C282Y) mutation in the HFE gene; however, rare forms of genetic iron overload must be diagnosed using a specific genetic analysis. We studied the genotype of 5 patients who had hyperferritinemia and an iron overload phenotype, but not classic mutations in the HFE gene. Two patients were undergoing phlebotomy and had no iron overload, 1 with metabolic syndrome and no phlebotomy had mild iron overload, and 2 patients had severe iron overload despite phlebotomy. The patients' first-degree relatives also underwent the analysis. We found 5 not previously published mutations: c.-408_-406delCAA in HFE, c.1118G>A (p.G373D), c.1473G>A (p.E491E) and c.2085G>C (p.S695S) in TFR2; and c.-428_-427GG>TT in SLC40A1. Moreover, we found 3 previously published mutations: c.221C>T (p.R71X) in HFE; c.1127C>A (p.A376D) in TFR2; and c.539T>C (p.I180T) in SLC40A1. Four patients were double heterozygous or compound heterozygous for the mutations mentioned above, and the patient with metabolic syndrome was heterozygous for a mutation in the TFR2 gene. Our findings show that hereditary hemochromatosis is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and that acquired factors may modify or determine the phenotype.	22890139
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene (HFE) polymorphisms and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis.	American journal of epidemiology	2012	5.04	The hemochromatosis gene (HFE) has been involved in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus and investigated in numerous epidemiologic studies. The current meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the gene-disease association in relevant studies. Electronic literature search was performed on June 18, 2011, from databases of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and HuGE Navigator. Articles were inspected by 2 authors independently, and data were extracted by identical extraction form. A total of 5,528 type 2 diabetes cases and 6,920 controls in relation to HFE polymorphisms (a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at amino acid position 282 (C282Y) and a histidine to aspartate substitution at amino acid position 63 (H63D)) were included in the meta-analysis (1997-2011). A fixed- or random-effect model was used to calculate the pooled odds ratios based on the results from the heterogeneity tests. An increased odds ratio for type 2 diabetes mellitus was observed in persons carrying a D allele at the H63D polymorphism compared with those with an H allele (odds ratio (OR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03, 1.41; P = 0.02). Moreover, carriers of a D allele had a modestly increased risk compared with persons with the wild genotype (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.25; P = 0.04). The C282Y variant was not significantly associated with diabetes risk. In summary, persons with a D allele may have a moderately increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.	22908207
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene mutations, liver function tests and iron status in alcohol-dependent patients admitted for detoxification.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2007	3.32	Screening of target populations for hemochromatosis (HFE) gene allele status has been recommended. Alcoholic liver disease may be associated with iron overload and there is evidence of excessive alcohol consumption among patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. This study determined the HFE gene allele status in alcohol-dependent patients and explored the associations between iron status, liver enzymes, and HFE status. A total of 151 consecutive patients admitted for alcohol detoxification were tested for HFE mutations, iron status, and liver function tests. The prevalence data were compared with those from a New Zealand population. manova was used to compare liver function tests and iron status for subjects with different HFE mutations. Three compound heterozygotes, one homozygote for C282Y, and one homozygote for H63D were found among the 151 patients. For the remaining 146 patients, there was no difference in the distribution of heterozygote status by allele, compared to the general New Zealand population. No HFE mutation: general population 64.4%, alcohol-dependent patients 64.4%; H63D: general population 23.6%, alcohol-dependent patients 28.1%; C282Y: general population 11.9%, alcohol-dependent patients 7.5% (P = 0.20). There was no relationship between liver function tests or iron status and HFE mutation status among the study group. No evidence has been found in the present that HFE allele status prevalence is different from the general population or associated with different liver function or iron status among alcohol-dependent patients. The cause of altered iron status among alcohol-dependent patients does not appear to be related to HFE status.	17565641
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE C282Y gene variant is a risk factor for the progression to decompensated liver disease in chronic viral hepatitis C subjects in the Czech population.	Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology	2007	2.21	To determine the prevalence of selected HFE polymorphisms (C282Y, H63D and S65C) among patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C and to investigate their role in the progression of liver disease. A total of 207 subjects with chronic B or C viral hepatitis and 243 healthy controls were enrolled in the case-control study. Cases were further classified into three groups according to the clinical stage of liver disease: (A) virus carriers; (B) compensated liver disease; and (C) decompensated liver disease. HFE polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction-based methodology. Fisher's exact test, chi(2) and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to test for differences in variables studied between groups. Haplotypes were inferred in silico and their distribution compared by permutation test. Modified survival (time-to-event) analysis was used to test for the differences in the progression to the decompensated liver disease in carriers of C282Y wild-type versus mutated genotypes. The frequency of HFE genotypes, alleles and haplotypes differed neither between HBV nor HCV patients versus controls. In HCV subjects: (i) the frequency of the 282Y allele was significantly higher in the (C) group compared to (B) group (12.5 vs 2.2%, respectively, P = 0.002, Fisher's exact test); and (ii) carriers of the 282Y mutation exhibited significantly faster progression to decompensated liver disease than wild-type carriers (P = 0.044, log-rank test). Carriage of the minor HFE C282Y polymorphism is associated with decompensated liver disease and its earlier onset in the subjects with chronic viral hepatitis C in the Czech population.	17573946
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[The prevalence of peripheral iron overload and the presence of HFE gene (H63D) mutation among the Korean patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease].	The Korean journal of hepatology	2007	0.5	There are controversies on the role of iron overload in the mechanism of liver injury in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of peripheral iron overload, and to study the presence of HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D, S65C) in a cohort of Korean NAFLD patients. 255 patients with NAFLD were included. The patients had been diagnosed as having NAFLD by the criteria of elevated aminotransferase levels, compatible ultrasonographic findings and exclusion of other etiologies. Blood samples were tested for chemistry, iron profile, and mutational analysis for HFE gene (C282Y, H63D, S65C). Of the 255 NAFLD patients, the prevalence of peripheral iron overload was 19.2% according to the cutoff level of transferrin saturation (TS) > 45%, and 3.9% of NAFLD patients were having hyperferritinemia over 400 ng/mL. Hyperferritinemia was significantly associated with elevated serum levels of fasting glucose, AST and TS. We found the presence of H63D mutation, either heterozygote or homozygote, among the NAFLD patients with peripheral iron overload. The prevalence of peripheral iron overload in the Korean NAFLD patients was not rare, and the presence of H63D mutation among NALFD patients was identified. Further studies on the significance of iron overload or HFE mutation in the pathogenesis of NAFLD are needed.	17585191
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of primary iron overload and HFE gene mutations (C282Y, H63D and S65C) in chronic liver disease patients in north India.	World journal of gastroenterology	2007	2.79	To identify the frequency of iron overload and study the three mutations in the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D, and S65C) in patients with chronic liver disorders (CLD) and controls. To identify patients with iron overload (transferrin saturation > 45% in females and > 50% in males and serum ferritin > 1000 ng/mL) we evaluated 236 patients with CLD, including 59 with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 22 with alcoholic liver disease (ALD), 19 of cirrhosis due to viruses (HBV, HCV), and 136 with cryptogenic cirrhosis. Mutations of the HFE gene were analyzed by PCR-RE. hundred controls were screened for iron status and the mutations. Seventeen patients with CLD showed evidence of iron overload. Fifteen cases of iron overload had cryptogenic cirrhosis and two had ALD. None of the controls showed iron overload. We did not find any individual with 282Y or 65C either in the cases or in the controls. The prevalence of H63D heterozygosity was 12% in normal individuals, 14.8% in 236 patients (16.9% in NASH, 13.6% in ALD, 26.3% in viral and 12.5% in cryptogenic cirrhosis) and the overall prevalence was 13.98%. Only two of the 17 patients with primary iron overload were heterozygous for H63D. One patient with NASH and one normal individual who were homozygous for H63D showed no iron overload. Primary iron overload in Indians is non-HFE type, which is different from that in Europeans and further molecular studies are required to determine the defect in various iron regulatory genes.	17589946
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Evaluation of HFE (hemochromatosis) mutations as genetic modifiers in sporadic AD and MCI.	Neurobiology of aging	2004	5.15	Pathological brain iron deposition has been implicated as a source of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species in Alzheimer disease (AD). Recent reports suggest that heterozygosity for the two common hfe mutations responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) may be a risk factor for AD, possibly by accelerating brain iron accumulation. To test this hypothesis, we genotyped 213 sporadic AD, 106 MCI, and 63 normal elderly control (NEC) individuals for the H63D and C282Y hfe mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. We determined the relationship of these mutations to the demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological features of AD and MCI, and evaluated whether an interaction existed between hfe and apolipoprotein E (apoE) status in these patients. We observed no significant impact of H63D or C282Y heterozygosity on age at AD symptoms onset or diagnosis, age at onset of cognitive symptoms (AD and MCI combined), rates of MCI-to-AD conversion or specific neuropsychological deficits. No interactions between hfe zygosity and apoE status were discerned. Patients homozygous for H63D exhibited trends towards accelerated MCI-to-AD conversion rates and a subset of younger individuals (aged 55-75) exhibited earlier onset of cognitive symptoms relative to wild-type hfe and H63D heterozygotes. Contrary to earlier reports, the results of the present study do not implicate the common hfe mutations as genetic modifiers of sporadic AD and MCI. Trends towards accelerated cognitive dysfunction in H63D homozygotes warrant further study.	15013567
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Extended haplotype analysis in the HLA complex reveals an increased frequency of the HFE-C282Y mutation in individuals with multiple sclerosis.	Human genetics	2004	5.14	In order to resolve a multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility locus that we had identified in earlier work at the telomeric end of the HLA complex, we genotyped another 34 microsatellite markers (47 in total) across the class I/extended class I region in 166 Tasmanian MS case and 104 control families (D6S299-D6S265). Extended MS susceptibility haplotypes, up to 9 Mb in length, were observed in 11% of MS cases and 4% of controls. Direct comparison of the telomerically extended portion of the MS susceptibility haplotype in HFE-Cys282Tyr (C282Y)-homozygous haemochromatosis patients identified a common ancestry for this genomic segment, which translated into an increased frequency of the C282Y allele in 489 MS cases from Tasmania and Victoria (10.2%) compared with controls (6.7%). Six C282Y homozygotes (1.2%), a three-fold increased rate over the general population, and 88 heterozygotes (18%) were identified. One C282Y-homozygous female was identified who had MS and was being treated for symptoms of iron overload. Interestingly, for 71 Victorian MS cases not of north western European (NWE) ancestry, a DR15-independent reduction in the frequency of the C282Y allele was observed, supporting the theory of a NWE origin for the C282Y-variant of the DR15 ancestral haplotype (C282Y-HLA-A*0301-B*0702-DRB1*1501-DQB1*0602). The results of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and log linear modelling analyses suggest that C282Y is increased in MS cases of NWE ancestry because it is in LD with the ancestral DR15 susceptibility haplotype (7.1) and that it does not play an independent role in predisposition to MS. However, our findings provide the impetus for further investigations into the role of iron metabolism in the severity of MS.	15014978
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Natural history of the C282Y homozygote for the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) with a normal serum ferritin level.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2003	7.68	The discovery of a genetic test for hereditary hemochromatosis has identified many individuals who are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene with a normal transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level. The long-term prognosis, rate of iron accumulation, and surveillance guidelines for these individuals are unknown. To determine the degree of iron accumulation over time, an updated serum ferritin level was obtained in patients initially identified as homozygous for the C282Y mutation with a normal serum ferritin level. Twenty-two asymptomatic untreated C282Y homozygotes with a normal serum ferritin level were identified, 10 through population screening, 9 through pedigree analysis, and 3 through a general medical work-up. There were 18 women (4 postmenopausal) and 4 men with a median age of 46 years, range 28-76 years. The median follow-up interval was 4 years, range 2-23 years. The serum ferritin levels of 20 of 22 patients remained below the upper limit of normal during the follow-up period. A decline in serum ferritin level was observed in 13 of 22 patients. Three patients had an increase in serum ferritin level of greater than 50%, with only 1 male patient exceeding the upper limit of normal by having a serum ferritin level increase from 295 to 344 microg/L during a 3-year period. In C282Y homozygotes with a normal ferritin level at the time of diagnosis, 20 of 22 patients failed to show any significant increase in serum ferritin level during a median follow-up of 4 years. This has clinical and economic implications for follow-up and surveillance of this selected population.	15017658
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE C282Y heterozygosity in hepatocellular carcinoma: evidence for an increased prevalence.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2003	7.68	Iron overload is observed frequently in chronic liver disease, and some studies have suggested that chronic iron overload may contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Heterozygosity for hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is associated with increased body iron stores. The discovery of the HH gene HFE has enabled identification of the heterozygote status. The aim of this study was to evaluate if heterozygosity for HH is a risk factor for HCC. The C282Y and the H63D mutation of the HFE gene were analyzed in 137 patients with HCC and no history of HH, 107 patients with cirrhosis without HCC and 126 healthy controls. Hepatic iron content was measured by using a semiquantitative histologic score. Seventeen of 137 HCC patients (12.4%) were C282Y heterozygote, compared with only 4 of 107 (3.7%) cirrhotic patients without HCC and 6 of 126 (4.8%) healthy controls (P < 0.05). The frequency of the H63D mutation showed no significant differences. C282Y heterozygote HCC patients had significantly higher levels of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation than C282Y wild-type patients (793 +/- 122 vs. 355 +/- 23 ng/mL, and 42.3% +/- 7.3% vs. 29.2% +/- 1.7%, respectively), and significantly higher iron deposition in HCC as well as in nontumorous liver tissue. The C282Y heterozygous genotype is significantly more common in HCC patients and is associated with significantly increased intrahepatic iron deposition and systemic iron stores. These results suggest that C282Y heterozygosity plays a role in liver iron deposition and could contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis via the accumulation of potentially carcinogenic iron. These findings may have implications for HCC screening and prevention strategies.	15017669
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE C282Y and H63D in adults with malignancies in a community medical oncology practice.	BMC cancer	2004	3.27	We sought to compare frequencies of HFE C282Y and H63D alleles and associated odds ratios (OR) in 100 consecutive unrelated white adults with malignancy to those in 318 controls. Data from patients with more than one malignancy were analyzed according to each primary malignancy. For the present study, OR > or =2.0 or < or =0.5 was defined to be increased or decreased, respectively. There were 110 primary malignancies (52 hematologic neoplasms, 58 carcinomas) in the 100 adult patients. Allele frequencies were similar in patients and controls (C282Y: 0.0850 vs. 0.0896, respectively (OR = 0.9); H63D: 0.1400 vs. 0.1447, respectively (OR = 0.9)). Two patients had hemochromatosis and C282Y homozygosity. With C282Y, increased OR occurred in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorders, and adenocarcinoma of prostate (2.0, 2.8, and 3.4, respectively); OR was decreased in myelodysplasia (0.4). With H63D, increased OR occurred in myeloproliferative disorders and adenocarcinomas of breast and prostate (2.4, 2.0, and 2.0, respectively); OR was decreased in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (0.5 and 0.4, respectively). In 100 consecutive adults with malignancy evaluated in a community medical oncology practice, frequencies of HFE C282Y or H63D were similar to those in the general population. This suggests that C282Y or H63D is not associated with an overall increase in cancer risk. However, odds ratios computed in the present study suggest that increased (or decreased) risk for developing specific types of malignancy may be associated with the inheritance of HFE C282Y or H63D. Study of more patients with these specific types of malignancies is needed to determine if trends described herein would remain and yield significant differences.	15018631
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HAMP gene mutation c.208T>C (p.C70R) identified in an Italian patient with severe hereditary hemochromatosis.	Human mutation	2004	5.09	Hepcidin is a recently identified hormone peptide involved in regulation of iron homeostasis. HAMP gene mutations have been described to date in five families with iron overload. We have identified the c.208T>C (p.C70R) mutation in the HAMP gene in a patient affected by a severe form of hereditary hemochromatosis. The variant, occurring in a highly conserved amino acid, disrupts one of the 4 intramolecular disulphide bonds present in hepcidin molecules of all vertebrates, and is presumably able to destabilize the peptide structure. The investigated patient was also found to harbor a heterozygous HFE c.845G>A (p.C282Y) mutation that may have contributed in increasing his iron burden.	15024747
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Molecular diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis: application of a newly-developed reverse-hybridization assay in the South African population.	Clinical genetics	2004	3.89	A recently developed strip-assay for hemochromatosis provides a rapid method for simultaneous detection of multiple mutations, which among others includes the HFE gene mutations V53M, V59M, H63D, H63H, S65C, Q127H, E168Q, and C282Y, previously detected in the general South African population using gel-based mutation-screening methods. The objective of the study was to determine the frequency of the relatively rare mutations in samples selected for altered iron parameters or a family history of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) as part of the validation process of the assay for routine diagnostic purposes. The study population consisted of 451 individuals previously screened for mutations C282Y and H63D by restriction enzyme analysis in order to confirm or possibly exclude a diagnosis of HH. These individuals were subjected to mutation screening using the commercially available hemochromatosis strip-assay. Previous positive results for mutations C282Y and H63D in 233 individuals confirmed the accuracy of the reverse-hybridization assay. Mutation S65C was detected in 13 Caucasians, including three compound heterozygotes. These constituted 2% (13/600) of the chromosomes without mutations C282Y or H63D. The African-specific HFE mutation V53M was detected in one out of 11 (9%) African subjects screened. Mutation E168Q was detected in a single Caucasian individual together with mutation H63D. Our data demonstrate the value of the strip-based technology in providing a rapid and reliable comprehensive test for simultaneous analysis of multiple mutations.	15025725
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotype, particulate air pollution, and heart rate variability: a gene-environment interaction.	Circulation	2006	17.05	Particulate air pollution has been associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Transition metals such as iron bound to the particles may be responsible for those associations. The protein product of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene modulates uptake of iron and divalent cations from pulmonary sources and reduces their toxicity. Two HFE polymorphisms (C282Y and H63D) associated with increased iron uptake may modify the effect of metal-rich particles on the cardiovascular system. We investigated the association between particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter and heart rate variability in 518 older men from the Normative Aging Study who were examined between November 2000 and December 2004. Linear regression models were fit to evaluate interactions between HFE genotype and particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter in relation to heart rate variability, controlling for potential confounders. A 10-microg/m3 increase in particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter during the 48 hours before heart rate variability measurement was associated with a 31.7% (95% CI, 10.3% to 48.1%) decrease in the high-frequency component of heart rate variability in persons with the wild-type genotype, whereas no relationship in the high-frequency component was observed in persons with either HFE variant. The difference in effect of particulate matter < or = 2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter on the high-frequency component between persons with and without HFE variants was significant (P for interaction=0.02). The effect of particles on cardiac autonomic function was shielded in subjects with at least 1 copy of an HFE variant compared with wild-type subjects. Transition metals, including iron, bound to ambient particles and the related oxidative stress may play an important role in cardiac toxicity of particles.	17145987
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of the hemochromatosis gene mutation in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and correlation with degree of liver fibrosis.	Arquivos de gastroenterologia		0.5	Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is a chronic liver disease with a high prevalence in the general population and a potential to evolve into cirrhosis. It is speculated that iron overload could be associated with liver injury and unfavorable progress in affected patients. To evaluate the prevalence of mutation of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and to correlate it with histological findings in liver specimens. Twenty-nine patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis were evaluated. The presence of mutation in the hemochromatosis gene (C282Y and H63D) was tested in all patients and its result was evaluated in relation to hepatic inflammatory activity, presence of fibrosis, and iron overload in the liver. The control group was composed of 20 patients with normal liver function tests and 20 patients infected with the hepatitis C virus, with elevated serum levels of aminotransferases and with chronic hepatitis as shown by biopsy. Mutation of the hemochromatosis gene (C282Y and/or H63D) was diagnosed in 16 (55.2%) patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, in 12 (60%) patients with hepatitis C and in 8 (40%) patients with no liver disease. No association was found between the presence of mutation and inflammatory activity, nor with the presence of fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. An association was found between the presence of mutation and the occurrence of iron overload in liver, but there was no association between liver iron and the occurrence of fibrosis. The findings suggest that iron does not play a major role in the pathogenesis and progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and routine tests of the hemochromatosis gene mutation in these patients should not be recommended.	17160239
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations in Brazilian thalassemic patients.	Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas	2006	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron metabolism characterized by increased iron intake and progressive storage and is related to mutations in the HFE gene. Interactions between thalassemia and hemochromatosis may further increase iron overload. The ethnic background of the Brazilian population is heterogeneous and studies analyzing the simultaneous presence of HFE and thalassemia-related mutations have not been carried out. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of the H63D, S65C and C282Y mutations in the HFE gene among 102 individuals with alpha-thalassemia and 168 beta-thalassemia heterozygotes and to compare them with 173 control individuals without hemoglobinopathies. The allelic frequencies found in these three groups were 0.98, 2.38, and 0.29% for the C282Y mutation, 13.72, 13.70, and 9.54% for the H63D mutation, and 0, 0.60, and 0.87% for the S65C mutation, respectively. The chi-square test for multiple independent individuals indicated a significant difference among groups for the C282Y mutation, which was shown to be significant between the beta-thalassemia heterozygote and the control group by the Fisher exact test (P value = 0.009). The higher frequency of inheritance of the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene among beta-thalassemic patients may contribute to worsen the clinical picture of these individuals. In view of the characteristics of the Brazilian population, the present results emphasize the need to screen for HFE mutations in beta-thalassemia carriers.	17160266
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Solution-phase DNA mutation scanning and SNP genotyping by nanoliter melting analysis.	Biomedical microdevices	2007	2.23	Solution-phase, DNA melting analysis for heterozygote scanning and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed in 10 nl volumes on a custom microchip. Human genomic DNA was PCR amplified in the presence of the saturating fluorescent dye, LCGreen Plus, and placed within microfluidic channels that were created between two glass slides. The microchip was heated at 0.1 degrees C/s with a Peltier device and viewed with an inverted fluorescence microscope modified for photomulitiplier tube detection. The melting data was normalized and the negative first derivative plotted against temperature. Mutation scanning for heterozygotes was easily performed by comparing the shape of the melting curve to homozygous standards. Genotyping of homozygotes by melting temperature (T(m)) required absolute temperature comparisons. Mutation scanning of ATM exon 17 and CFTR exon 10 identified single base change heterozygotes in 84 and 201 base-pair (bp) products, respectively. All genotypes at HFE C282Y were distinguished by simple melting analysis of a 40-bp fragment. Sequential analysis of the same sample on the gold-standard, commercial high-resolution melting instrument HR-1, followed by melting in a 10 nl reaction chamber, produced similar results. DNA melting analysis requires only minutes after PCR and is a simple method for genotyping and scanning that can be reduced to nanoliter volumes. Microscale systems for performing DNA melting reduce the reagents/DNA template required with a promise for high throughput analysis in a closed chamber without risk of contamination.	17165128
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Miscellaneous non-inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions. Haemochromatosis: the bone and the joint.	Best practice & research. Clinical rheumatology	2011	0.5	Genetic haemochromatosis is a hereditary disease characterised by tissue iron overload. In Caucasians it is most often due to homozygous C282Y HFE gene mutation, but other genes may be involved. Without treatment by venesections, patients can develop life-threatening visceral damage such as liver cirrhosis and carcinoma, diabetes or heart failure. This treatment has been remarkably successful in preventing these complications, but patients survive with other symptoms of the disease susceptible to impair, sometimes seriously, their quality of life. This is the case of arthropathy and osteoporosis complicating haemochromatosis. In this chapter, focus has been placed on the rheumatological complications of genetic haemochromatosis.	22142745
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for iron overload in the Turkish population.	Digestive diseases (Basel, Switzerland)	2003	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), the most common autosomal recessive disease in the white population, is characterized by excessive gastrointestinal absorption of iron and loading of parenchymal organs. HFE mutations of C282Y and H63D are largely responsible for HH in populations of Celtic ancestry. Although many screening studies related to HH have been done in Northern Europe, the USA and Australia, as yet, no such study has been published on Turkey. In this study we aimed to screen the Turkish population for iron overload. Random samples were obtained from 4,633 healthy adults (3,827 male, 806 female, mean age +/- SD 35 +/- 8 years, range 14-76) for the measurement of transferrin saturation (TS). Measurements were repeated after an overnight fast in the subjects whose initial TS was > or =50%. Serum ferritin levels and C282Y and H63D gene mutations were studied in cases when fasting TS was > or =50%. In cases where the serum ferritin level was >200 ng/ml with or without HFE mutations, liver biopsy was performed for histological evaluation and determination of iron content. In 158 subjects, TS was > or =50% in the non-fasting state. A second determination of TS after an overnight fast was performed in 135 subjects. In 26 subjects, the TS was > or =50% in the fasting state. HFE mutation and serum ferritin levels were measured in these 26 subjects. Eleven subject (10 male, 1 female) were heterozygote and 1 male subject was homozygote in reference to H63D. C282Y mutation was not found. Four of these 26 subjects (all males, aged 23, 24, 40, 49) had increased serum ferritin levels and liver biopsy was performed. In 1 male (aged 49) who was heterozygote for H63D genotype with a serum ferritin level of 645 ng/ml, iron overload in liver tissue was shown by histology as well as atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The prevalence of hemochromatosis in the Turkish population is much lower in comparison to populations of Celtic ancestry and C282Y mutation is non-existent.	14571105
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Polymorphisms of hemochromatosis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin genes in Egyptian HCV patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma.	Gene	2011	2.32	Hereditary hemochromatosis and alpha-1antitrypsin deficiency are genetic diseases characterized by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress with subsequent development of liver disease. Our aim was to estimate the frequency of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutant alleles (C282Y and H63D) and alpha-1 antitrypsin S/Z variants among Egyptian HCV cirrhotic patients and in hepatocellular carcinoma patients and to evaluate their effects on disease progression. HFE and alpha-1 antitrypsin polymorphisms were characterized in 200 Egyptian patients with HCV infection (100 patients complicated with cirrhosis, 100 patients with HCC) and 100 healthy subjects who had no history of any malignancy. The frequencies of HD genotype of H63D mutation were significantly increased in HCC patients compared to control group and to cirrhosis group. Also, the frequencies of DD genotype were significantly increased In HCC group compared to control group and to cirrhosis group. Our results suggested that Carriers of the D allele of H63D mutation were significantly more likely to develop HCC.	21925577
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hemochromatosis. Determination of the C282Y mutation frequency in the population of the Czech Republic and sensitivity of hemochromatosis detection using Guthrie cards].	Casopis lekaru ceskych	1999	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is a multi-organ disease characterized by increased deposition of iron in some tissues. When discovered early the disease is curable. The Caucasian population is burdened with a high incidence of carriers and homozygotes. The recent discovery of the gene for haemochromatosis (HFE) and of the major mutation C282Y makes direct diagnosis possible. Exploiting a newly-designed polymerase chain reaction system, we determined the frequency of the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in the Czech population by analysis of 278 chromosomes from anonymous clients of an in vitro fertilization centre (128 male and 150 female karyotypes respectively). There were 14 heterozygotes of the C282Y mutation (6 males and 8 females) and no asymptomatic homozygotes. All 12 patients with classically diagnosed haemochromatosis were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. Twelve Guthrie cards ten years old were tested as a source of the PCR signal for C282Y with a positive result in all cases (100% efficiency). Our data suggest that the approximate frequency of heterozygotes (carriers) of hereditary haemochromatosis in the Czech population is 1:10 which is comparable with data from the Central European region. The frequency of the major mutation among patients with HH was 100% (12/12), however, the difference with data from neighbouring countries (Austria, Germany) cannot be considered significant due to the small number of patients tested. We also showed the possibility of a retro-diagnosis of the presence/absence of C282Y mutation from Guthrie cards.	10566227
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene mutations in chronic hepatitis C patients with and without liver siderosis.	Journal of medical virology	2000	2.0	Chronic hepatitis C is often associated with liver iron overload, which may affect the long-term prognosis and the response to antiviral treatment. The occurrence of hemochromatosis (HFE) mutations were studied to determine whether may contribute to the liver iron overload of chronic hepatitis C patients. The prevalence of two HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) in 120 chronic hepatitis C patients was determined and the findings were correlated with clinical, histological and virological features. Hepatic iron was determined semiquantitatively by a histochemical hepatic iron index, defined as the ratio of a histochemical staining score to the patient's age, after correction for heterogeneous lobular iron distribution. Serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA was measured by bDNA assay and typed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Liver HCV RNA was measured by a semi-quantitative strand-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Excess liver iron was stained in the liver of 36 patients (30%). Siderotic patients had the same geographic origin, serum and liver HCV RNA levels and H63D and C282Y mutations frequency as non-siderotic patients. However, siderotic patients were older (P = 0.015), more frequently males (P = 0.02), less frequently infected with HCV genotype 3 (P = 0.037) and had a higher liver fibrosis score (P = 0.008). The liver iron content did not correlate with the serum or liver HCV RNA titers. Ten of the 36 patients with liver siderosis had neither a history of excess alcohol intake, multiple transfusions, or HFE mutations. In conclusion, the pathogenesis of the liver iron overload in chronic hepatitis C patients cannot be fully explained by the occurrence of HFE mutations. The exact mechanism of iron accumulation in these patients therefore remains unexplained.	10568758
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Sample-to-SNP kit: a reliable, easy and fast tool for the detection of HFE p.H63D and p.C282Y variations associated to hereditary hemochromatosis.	Gene	2012	2.32	Classical hereditary hemochromatosis involves the HFE-gene and diagnostic analysis of the DNA variants HFE p.C282Y (c.845G>A; rs1800562) and HFE p.H63D (c.187C>G; rs1799945). The affected protein alters the iron homeostasis resulting in iron overload in various tissues. The aim of this study was to validate the TaqMan-based Sample-to-SNP protocol for the analysis of the HFE-p.C282Y and p.H63D variants with regard to accuracy, usefulness and reproducibility compared to an existing SNP protocol. The Sample-to-SNP protocol uses an approach where the DNA template is made accessible from a cell lysate followed by TaqMan analysis. Besides the HFE-SNPs other eight SNPs were used as well.

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Extensive myocardial iron deposition in a patient with hepatitis C.	Texas Heart Institute journal	2012	0.79	During a cardiac evaluation prior to liver transplantation, a 51-year-old man with hepatitis C and cirrhosis was found to have nonischemic cardiomyopathy-a condition that would have made him ineligible for liver transplantation. Right ventricular biopsy revealed extensive cardiac hemosiderosis. Despite the elevated levels of serum ferritin, the patient had no history of multiple red blood cell transfusions; moreover, genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis was negative for the HFE mutations C282Y and H63D. Chelation therapy was considered for this patient, to reduce the cardiac iron deposits. However, before a course of treatment was established, the patient's clinical condition worsened, and chelation therapy was no longer feasible. He was referred for combined heart and liver transplantation. Cardiac iron deposition can be diagnosed readily using right ventricular biopsy or T2* magnetic resonance imaging. Early detection may allow time for intensive chelation therapy, which might, in turn, reverse the myopathic process. Improved cardiac function should improve cirrhosis patients' chances to be placed on the liver transplant waiting list and ultimately optimize transplantation outcomes.	22740754
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The global prevalence of HFE and non-HFE hemochromatosis estimated from analysis of next-generation sequencing data.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics	2016	7.71	The prevalence of HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) among European populations has been well studied. There are no prevalence data for atypical forms of HH caused by mutations in HFE2, HAMP, TFR2, or SLC40A1. The purpose of this study was to estimate the population prevalence of these non-HFE forms of HH. A list of HH pathogenic variants in publically available next-generation sequence (NGS) databases was compiled and allele frequencies were determined. Of 161 variants previously associated with HH, 43 were represented among the NGS data sets; an additional 40 unreported functional variants also were identified. The predicted prevalence of HFE HH and the p.Cys282Tyr mutation closely matched previous estimates from similar populations. Of the non-HFE forms of iron overload, TFR2-, HFE2-, and HAMP-related forms are predicted to be rare, with pathogenic allele frequencies in the range of 0.00007 to 0.0005. Significantly, SLC40A1 variants that have been previously associated with autosomal-dominant ferroportin disease were identified in several populations (pathogenic allele frequency 0.0004), being most prevalent among Africans. We have, for the first time, estimated the population prevalence of non-HFE HH. This methodology could be applied to estimate the population prevalence of a wide variety of genetic disorders.Genet Med 18 6, 618-626.	26633544
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis: a systematic review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.	Annals of internal medicine	2006	16.44	The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has not previously considered screening for hereditary hemochromatosis for a recommendation as a clinical preventive service for primary care clinicians. To conduct a focused systematic review of hereditary hemochromatosis screening relating to 2 USPSTF criteria, the burden of suffering and the potential effectiveness of a preventive intervention, to determine whether evidence is sufficient for a USPSTF recommendation. MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases from 1966 through February 2005. The authors supplemented literature searches with source materials from experts in the field and the bibliographies of key reviews and included studies. Studies were retrieved to answer 3 key questions: 1) What is the risk for developing clinical hemochromatosis among those with a homozygous C282Y genotype? 2) Does earlier therapeutic phlebotomy of individuals with primary iron overload due to hereditary hemochromatosis reduce morbidity and mortality compared with treatment after diagnosis in routine clinical care? 3) Are there groups at increased risk for developing hereditary hemochromatosis that can be readily identified before genetic screening? The authors critically appraised studies using quality criteria specific to their design. The authors abstracted all studies into evidence tables using condition definitions and diagnostic criteria. Data were insufficient to define a very precise estimate of penetrance. Available data suggest that up to 38% to 50% of C282Y homozygotes may develop iron overload, with up to 10% to 33% eventually developing hemochromatosis-associated morbidity. Prevalence of C282Y homozygosity is higher in family members of probands and other high-risk patient groups defined by signs, symptoms, and phenotypic screening. This review considered genetic screening for HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis in C282Y homozygotes only. Available research is limited, is based solely on observational designs, and is plagued by poor or inconsistent reporting. Research addressing genetic screening for hereditary hemochromatosis remains insufficient to confidently project the impact of, or estimate the benefit from, widespread or high-risk genetic screening for hereditary hemochromatosis.	16880463
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	"""[Hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome associated to the HFE gene mutation. Two new Spanish families and a new mutation (A37T: """"Zaragoza"""")]."""	Medicina clinica	2006	1.27	Nuclear congenital cataracts associated with hyperferritinemia--hereditary hyperferritinemia cataract syndrome (HHCS)--without clinical or biochemical signs of iron overload have been recently described in several Spanish families. This HHCS is associated with mutations in the gene of ferritin subunit L, located in chromosome 19. We describe 2 new families with HHCS, one of them presenting a new L-ferritin mutation (A37T: -Zaragoza-). Patients and probands were studied according to the Anemia Unit protocol: complete blood count, biochemical profile (diabetes, hepatic and renal), hepatic serologies, iron metabolism (iron, transferrin, ferritin, transferrin saturation, reactive C protein) and mutation HFE gene studies (C282Y, H63D). All of them were sent to the Ophthalmology Service for cataract study. L-ferritin mutational scanning was performed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). Samples displaying an altered elution profile, as compared to a wild type control, were directly sequenced for the precise characterization of the L-ferritin mutation. Family A proband was a 54 year-old-female, with cataracts, ferritin level: 942 pg/I, transferrin saturation: 14%, HFE gen study: H63D/H63D; L-ferritin gene study: C33T mutation/-. Her two sons had cataracts, hyperferritinemia (1607, and 1188 pg/I, respectively), normal transferrin saturation (40% and 9%), HFE gene study: H63D/N; and L-ferritin gen study: C33T/-. Family B proband was a 39 year-old-female, with cataract, ferritin level: 636 pg/I, transferrin saturation: 25%, HFE gene study: H63D/N; and L-ferritin gene study: A37T/-. Her two sons, sister, brother and nephew, who were affected with A37T mutation, showed hyperferritinemia (883, 747, 835, 613 and 1396 pg/I) with normal transferrin saturation levels (17%, 34%, 25%, 18% and 24%); but the ferritin levels of those non-affected were normal (35 and 50 pg/I). HHCS is a dominant autosomic condition, with a possible world-wide distribution,which should be included in the differential diagnosis of hyperferritinemia studies. It is important to suspect it in order to avoid wrong treatment.	16900584
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Searching for hereditary hemochromatosis.	Clinical laboratory science : journal of the American Society for Medical Technology	2006	0.5	To detect hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) in low-income residents of a medically underserved region through free screening and confirmatory laboratory testing and to raise awareness of HH in the general population. Two-tiered reflexive laboratory testing was used to screen for HH. Participants evaluated the project by written survey upon its conclusion. Data were analyzed by descriptive techniques. Local public health departments in 18 counties in western North Carolina (WNC). PARTICIPANTS/SUBJECTS: Phase 1: adult volunteers age > or = 20 without previous diagnosis of HH; Phase 2: Phase 1 participants with elevated screening results and adult family members of Phase 2 participants found to have HFE mutations; Phase 3: randomly-selected Phase 1 participants (Survey A) and all Phase 2 participants with HFE mutations (Survey B). Phase 1 (initial screening): non-fasting blood collection by venipuncture with testing for transferrin saturation (TS). Phase 2 (confirmatory testing): fasting blood collection by venipuncture for TS, serum ferritin (SF), and cheek swab for DNA analysis for two HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D). Phase 3: written Surveys A and B. Total number participants screened for HH; prevalence of elevated TS in Phase 1 participants; prevalence of HFE genotypes consistent with HH (C282Y/C282Y and C282Y/H63D) in Phase 2 participants; prevalence of elevated SF in subjects with HFE mutations; number of family members tested; number of participants being treated for HH as a result of screening; increase in awareness of HH among Phase 1 participants. 2,034 total subjects participated in screening events and/or family member testing. Of the 1,976 Phase 1 participants, 130 (6.6%) had elevated TS (> or = 45%). Twenty of 130 (15.4%) Phase 2 subjects were homozygotes for C282Y. The prevalence of the C282Y/C282Y genotype among the Phase 1 participants who were tested in Phase 2 was 20/1976 (1.0%). Fourteen of 20 (70%) C282Y homozygotes had elevated SE Eleven of 130 (8.5%) Phase 2 subjects were compound heterozygotes for C282Y and H63D, and none had elevated SE Of 58 family members tested, two (3.4%) were homozygotes for C282Y and eight (13.8%) were compound heterozygotes for C282Y and H63D. One of two (50%) family members homozygous for C282Y had an elevated SE No compound heterozygotes had elevated SE Sixty-four of 120 (54.2%) Phase 1 subjects responded to Survey A. 53.1% of respondents were unaware of HH prior to the screening event. 92.1% of respondents told their family and friends about HH after participating. 73.4% discussed their laboratory results with their healthcare provider. Twenty of 41 participants (48.8%) found to have HFE mutations associated with HH responded to Survey B. Eleven of 20 (55.0%) stated that they were being treated for HH. The prevalence of the major genetic mutation, C282Y/C282Y, associated with HH among Phase 1 study participants in WNC was 1%, more than three times the national prevalence of approximately 0.33%. Results suggest that free screening using laboratory tests in a two-tiered reflexive approach may be an effective means of detecting HH, especially in high-risk populations. Early detection through free laboratory screening tests may reduce morbidity and, ultimately, healthcare costs for low-income individuals. Awareness of HH as a health concern may increase as a result of publicity generated by screening events.	16910235
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[ALLELES C282Y AND H63D HFE GENE, INSULIN RESISTANCE AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DISTURBANCE OF PORPHYRIN METABOLISM IN NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE].	Eksperimental'naia i klinicheskaia gastroenterologiia = Experimental & clinical gastroenterology	2015	0.5	The aim of the present work was to study the frequency of genotypes and alleles of C282Y and H63D HFE gene that may be associated with impaired porphyrin metabolism, as well as possible reasons for the formation of dysmetabolism porphyrins with NAFLD. The study involved 65 patients (52 men and 13 women) aged 21 to 69 years (mean age 48.5±1.5 years). Excretion uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, 6-aminolevulinic acid of porphobilinogen in urine was determined by chromatography and spectrophotometry calculated total excretion of porphyrins. Allele frequencies C282Y and H63D were determined during the molecular genetic analysis of DNA using the polymerase chain reaction followed by analysis of length polymorphism restraktsionnyh fragments. Condition of carbohydrate metabolism was evaluated by the level of fasting blood glucose and standard glucose tolerance test. Diagnosis of insulin resistance was performed according to the criteria proposed by the European Group for the Study of insulin resistance (EGIR). Skill test for the C282Y mutation carriage and H63D in the HFE gene in 65 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Disturbances in the metabolism of porphyrins were recorded in 43 (66.2%) patients. H63D and C282Y mutations were found in 18 (27.7%) patients, of whom 13 (72.2%) people with different options dismetabolism porphyrins and signs of insulin resistance. In 47 (72.3%) patients without mutations studied porphyrin metabolism disorders were detected in 30 (63.8 %), of which insulin resistance is registered only in 16 (34.0 %). Detection of mutations C282Y and H63D in the HFE gene in combination with disorders of porphyrin metabolism on the background of insulin resistance is likely to allow such patients considered as candidates for inclusion in the higher risk of formation of diabetes.	26281176
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels in persons with HFE C282Y homozygosity, a common hemochromatosis genotype: the HEIRS study.	Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association	2008	3.78	Relationships of thyroid and iron measures in large cohorts are unreported. We evaluated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4) in white participants of the primary care-based Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study. We measured serum TSH and free T4 in 176 HFE C282Y homozygotes without previous hemochromatosis diagnoses and in 312 controls without HFE C282Y or H63D who had normal serum iron measures and were matched to C282Y homozygotes for Field Center, age group, and initial screening date. We defined hypothyroidism as having TSH >5.00 mIU/L and free T4 <0.70 ng/dL, and hyperthyroidism as having TSH <0.400 mIU/L and free T4 >1.85 ng/dL. Multivariate analyses were performed using age, sex, Field Center, log(10) serum ferritin (SF), HFE genotype, log(10) TSH, and log(10) free T4. Prevalences of hypothyroidism in C282Y homozygotes and controls were 1.7% and 1.3%, respectively, and of hyperthyroidism 0% and 1.0%, respectively. Corresponding prevalences did not differ significantly. Correlations of log(10) SF with log(10) free T4 were positive (p = 0.2368, C282Y homozygotes; p = 0.0492, controls). Independent predictors of log(10) free T4 were log(10) TSH (negative association) and age (positive association); positive predictors of log(10) SF were age, male sex, and C282Y homozygosity. Proportions of C282Y homozygotes and controls who took medications to supplement or suppress thyroid function did not differ significantly. Prevalences of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are similar in C282Y homozygotes without previous hemochromatosis diagnoses and controls. In controls, there is a significant positive association of SF with free T4. We conclude that there is no rationale for routine measurement of TSH or free T4 levels in hemochromatosis or iron overload screening programs.	18651828
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serial serum ferritin measurements in untreated HFE C282Y homozygotes in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study.	International journal of laboratory hematology	2008	2.4	Hemochromatosis has often been associated with progressive iron overload, but the natural history of iron accumulation in untreated C282Y homozygotes has been reported infrequently. The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study screened 101 168 primary care participants for iron overload using transferrin saturation, unbound iron-binding capacity, Serum ferritin (SF), and HFE C282Y and H63D genotyping. SF was measured at initial screening (IS) and again when selected participants returned for a clinical examination (CE). The change in SF over the observation period (defined as ferritin rate of change) was analyzed according to age, gender, initial SF, initial SF/age, transferrin saturation, and iron removed by phlebotomy in C282Y homozygotes. Seventy-four male and 133 female untreated C282Y homozygotes were observed over a median of 112 days (34-924 days) between IS and CE. In men, SF increased in 54% and decreased in 46%. In women, SF increased in 50% and decreased in 50%. The significant variables affecting the SF rate were initial log SF (P = 0.0027) and transferrin saturation (P < 0.0001). Male C282Y homozygotes with higher SF rates (n = 27, upper 50th percentile) had significantly greater iron removed by phlebotomy (mean 4.93 g, range 1.0-17 g) than those with lower SF rates (n = 26, lower 50th percentile) (mean 2.6 g, 0.42-7.1, P < 0.05). SF was as likely to decrease as increase in untreated C282Y homozygotes over this relatively brief observation period. Incremental increases in SF are not inevitable in untreated C282Y homozygotes.	18665827
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Cancer risk in HFE C282Y homozygotes: results from the HUNT 2 study.	Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology	2013	2.2	In addition to hepatocellular cancer, HFE C282Y homozygotes are reported to have increased risk of colorectal cancer and breast cancer. This study was done to further explore the cancer risk in C282Y homozygotes. We studied cancer incidence in 292 homozygotes and 62,568 others that participated in the HUNT 2 population screening in 1995-1997. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we estimated cancer hazard ratio as a function of C282Y homozygosity and several screening variables including serum transferrin saturation, alcohol consumption and daily smoking. Cancer was diagnosed in 36 homozygotes, five of which had two cancer diagnoses. The overall cancer incidence was not increased in C282Y homozygotes (hazard ratio 1.10 [95% CI 0.60-2.03] in women and 0.94 [95% CI 0.53-1.66] in men). However, homozygous men had increased risk of colorectal cancer (hazard ratio 3.03 [95% CI 1.17-7.82], p = 0.022) and primary liver cancer (hazard ratio 54.0 [95% CI 2.68-1089], p = 0.009). The risk of breast cancer in homozygous women was not increased (hazard ratio 1.13 [95% CI 0.35-3.72]). Adjusted for other variables including C282Y homozygosity, very low and very high serum transferrin saturation were associated with increased overall cancer incidence. C282Y homozygosity is associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer and hepatocellular cancer in men. In the general population, individuals with a very low or a very high serum transferrin saturation may have increased cancer risk.	23281741
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Determinants and characteristics of mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin concentration in white HFE C282Y homozygotes in the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening study.	American journal of hematology	2007	5.0	Elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is common in persons with hemochromatosis associated with HFE C282Y homozygosity. We evaluated data from the subset of non-Hispanic white participants in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study to determine if elevated MCV in C282Y homozygotes is related to this genotype or to serum iron measures. Regression analysis was used to model MCV and Hb from transferrin saturation (TfSat), serum ferritin (SF), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, red blood cell count, age, HFE genotype, Field Center, and presence of liver-related abnormalities in C282Y homozygotes and control subjects without HFE mutations (wt/wt genotype). Mean MCV was higher in C282Y homozygotes than in HFE wt/wt controls (94.4 vs. 89.7 fL in women; 95.3 vs. 91.2 fL in men; P < 0.0001 for both). These differences were largely associated with increased mean TfSat and SF in C282Y homozygotes. Adjusted mean MCV was 92.0 fL (95% confidence interval, 91.1, 92.9) in female C282Y homozygotes and 90.9 fL (90.3, 91.5) in controls. Among women with SF in the reference range 20-200 microg/L, adjusted mean MCV was 92.9 fL, (91.7, 94.2) in C282Y homozygotes, 1.8 fL higher than in controls (P = 0.013). The adjusted mean MCV of male C282Y homozygotes and controls was similar (P = 0.30). Adjusted mean Hb was 0.2 g/dL higher in women with C282Y/C282Y than in controls. Greater mean MCV in C282Y homozygosity reflects increased mean TfSat and mean SF in men and women; an additional effect of genotype on MCV and Hb was detected in women.	17597476
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[The hemochromatosis gene (HFE). Molecular analysis--diagnostic applications].	Transfusion clinique et biologique : journal de la Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine	1998	0.56	Hemochromatosis is the most common single gene disorder in Caucasian populations. Regulation of iron balance by intestine is impaired, leading to a widespread deposition of iron, and the disease is associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Typically the excess of iron treated by phlebotomies is performed in our Blood Center. In 1996 an original paper identifying HFE as a strong candidate gene for hemochromatosis was published and two mutations were described (C282Y and H63D). The former results in a cysteine to tyrosine substitution at amino acid 282 and was found in different patient populations up to 80-90% of patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation. The frequency of the second variant H63D is also increased in hemochromatosis patients but its penetrance is probably not complete. Assessing clinical implications is a new way of identifying patients at risk for this frequent and probably underdiagnosed disease, and important because treatment by venesections is safe with a proven benefit in preventing development of the disease. Four hundred and eighty patients were included in our study and we have shown in this work a correlation between the genotype and the phenotypic presentation of the disorder, with patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation having a greater excess of iron.	9789968
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A 6p22 reference map of leukocyte DNA: exclusion of rearrangement in four cases of atypical haemochromatosis.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG		4.58	We describe a 4 Mb reference map of the haemochromatosis gene region in leukocyte DNA from seven controls and four atypical haemochromatosis patients. Three patients had normal coding sequence for HFE, the candidate gene for genetic haemochromatosis (GH). The fourth patient had classical GH but was heterozygous for Cys282Tyr with otherwise normal coding sequence. The genomic DNA was mapped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using five rare-cutting enzymes. Seventeen probes including HFE were positioned on the map. Despite proximity to the highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC), no polymorphism was observed in the control group with these telomeric probes. Furthermore, major rearrangement of the HFE region was excluded as a mutation contributing to iron overload in these atypical patients. Maps of cloned DNA are linked through genes and other probes to this reference map of the HFE region in uncloned genomic DNA.	9801878
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Determination of gene frequencies for two common haemochromatosis mutations in the Danish population by a novel polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers.	Tissue antigens	1998	2.05	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH), a condition of abnormal iron metabolism which leads to iron overload and organ damage, previously known as bronze diabetes or idiopathic haemochromatosis, is the most common disease-producing genetic disorder among Europeans. Two mutations, C282Y and H63D, are described for the candidate gene, HFE, reported as being responsible for the disease. Since molecular testing of these mutations will be of value in early diagnosis of haemochromatosis, the aim of this study was to develop a simple, fast and inexpensive technique for the determination of the polymorphism in the HFE gene on a large scale. We designed sequence-specific primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP) and tested 200 randomly selected healthy Danes and found the result completely comparable to results obtained by a previously described method, PCR-RFLP. The gene frequencies in the Danish population are similar to reported results for the White population, with a frequency of 0.068 for the C282Y mutation and a frequency of 0.128 for the H63D mutation.	9802602
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The clinical relevance of compound heterozygosity for the C282Y and H63D substitutions in hemochromatosis.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2006	7.68	Two major mutations are defined within the hemochromatosis gene, HFE. Although the effects of the C282Y substitution have been well characterized, the clinical significance of the C282Y/H63D state remains unclear. This study assessed the phenotypic expression in C282Y/H63D subjects as compared with C282Y homozygotes. Data were obtained from 91 C282Y/H63D probands, 158 C282Y/H63D subjects identified through family screening, and 483 C282Y homozygotes. Subjects underwent clinical evaluation, genotyping, biochemical assessment, and liver biopsy examination where clinically indicated. C282Y/H63D probands had significantly less clinical and biochemical expression than C282Y homozygotes. Biochemical expression was higher in C282Y/H63D probands than in C282Y/H63D subjects identified through family screening (P < .001). Of the C282Y/H63D subjects with serum ferritin levels greater than 1000 mug/L, all had known comorbid factors that could have contributed to the increased ferritin level. Of the 51 C282Y/H63D subjects who underwent liver biopsy examination, significantly increased iron stores were present in 9 subjects and hepatic fibrosis was present in 13. Twelve of the 13 had evidence of hepatic steatosis, excess alcohol consumption, or diabetes. The mobilizable iron level was significantly higher in C282Y homozygous males than in compound heterozygous males (P < .001). Genetic screening of C282Y/H63D first-degree relatives detected 5 C282Y homozygotes. C282Y/H63D subjects referred for assessment had a high prevalence of increased iron indices but did not develop progressive clinical disease without comorbid factors such as steatosis, diabetes, or excess alcohol consumption. When fibrosis was seen, 1 or more comorbid factors almost always were present. Thus, phlebotomy therapy is warranted and cascade screening of relatives should be performed because expressing C282Y homozygotes may be detected.	16979952

Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Helicobacter pylori infections are associated with iron deficiency, even in the absence of bleeding. To determine whether H. pylori infection plays a role in modifying the phenotype of patients homozygous for the c.845 G > A (C282Y) mutation of the HFE gene we studied 79 homozygous women and 76 homozygous men, comparing the pretreatment hemoglobin, MCV, serum ferritin, transferrin saturation of those who were seropositive and seronegative for H. pylori. No difference between seropositive and seronegative homozytoes was found. There was also no difference between seropositive and seronegative control subjects. We also compared the total iron of 56 of the male and 32 of the female homozygotes as determined by serial phlebotomy. No significant difference was found.	16996754
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Significance of left atrial contractile function in asymptomatic subjects with hereditary hemochromatosis.	The American journal of cardiology	2006	0.5	Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) have been reported to develop diastolic functional abnormalities detectable by echocardiography, but it is unknown whether these occur in asymptomatic subjects. Thus, this study tested whether echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) relaxation abnormalities are detectable in subjects with asymptomatic HH. Forty-three asymptomatic subjects with HH (C282Y homozygosity in the HFE gene) and 21 age- and gender-matched control subjects without known HFE mutations underwent echocardiography with comprehensive diastolic functional evaluations. Subjects with HH were in New York Heart Association functional class I and consisted of 22 newly diagnosed patients (group A) and 21 chronically phlebotomized subjects with stable iron levels (group B). Group A subjects showed significant iron overload compared with group B subjects and controls (group C) (ferritin 1,164 +/- 886 [p <0.05 vs groups B and C], 128 +/- 262, and 98 +/- 76 microg/L and transferrin saturation 79 +/- 19% [p <0.05 vs groups B and C], 42 +/- 21%, and 26 +/- 10% for groups A, B, and C, respectively). Echocardiographic evaluation revealed (1) no statistically significant abnormalities of Doppler LV relaxation in HH groups; (2) significant augmentation of atrial contractile function in subjects with HH compared with controls, which was not correlated with iron levels and treatment status; and (3) the preservation of overall LV systolic function in HH groups. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the augmentation of atrial contraction appears to be an early detectable echocardiographic cardiac manifestation of abnormal diastolic function in asymptomatic subjects with HH, which may reflect undetectable subclinical LV relaxation abnormalities.	16996882

Medical molecular morphology	2006	1.47	This review of the copper-iron interaction in Wilson's disease was mainly based on ten patients (three females and seven males) studied in our institutes because the genetic tests of ATP7B for Wilson's disease of primary copper toxicosis and HFE for hemochromatosis, the biochemical parameters of copper and iron, and morphological studies on biopsied liver specimens were complete. All patients had hypoceruloplasminemia and hepatic lesions compatible with Wilson's disease. One patient was homozygous and nine patients were compound heterozygous for the mutations in ATP7B, and all patients were free from the major mutation, C282Y, of HFE. The biochemical parameters of iron metabolism were not specific, except for serum ferritin concentration. Judging from the traditional criteria, seven patients had hyperferritinemia. Histochemical iron was stained in the livers of seven patients and histochemical copper was found in nine patients. Microanalysis was more sensitive than histochemistry, detecting copper and iron accumulation in the hepatocellular lipofuscin particles of all patients. Using an improved fixative, intralipofuscin distribution was found to be different between cuprothionein and iron complexes. Iron overload in Wilson's disease might be worsened after treatment because of the close relation to hypoceruloplasminemia, in which the iron efflux from the liver to the circulation is disturbed.	16998622
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Dual diagnoses of hereditary hyperferritinaemia-cataract syndrome and hereditary haemochromatosis.	Clinical and laboratory haematology	2006	0.5	A 30-year-old woman was found to have hyperferritinaemia after presenting with menorrhagia and lethargy. Serum iron studies did not confirm iron overload. Further investigations revealed two distinct genetic mutations of iron haemostasis--homozygosity for C282Y mutation of the HFE gene on chromosome 6 and heterozygosity for A40G mutation in the iron response element of ferritin light chain on chromosome 19. These mutations are responsible for the diseases hereditary haemochromatosis (autosomal recessive) and hereditary hyperferritinaemia-cataract syndrome (autosomal dominant) respectively. This is the first description of such a patient.	16999731
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The significance of the hemochromatosis genetic variants in multiple myeloma in comparison to that of myelodysplastic syndrome.	Annals of hematology	2006	3.02	The clinical experience of the significant difference in iron metabolism between multiple myeloma and myelodysplasia prompted us to analyse patients according to mutation frequency in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) known to participate in the regulation of iron metabolism. HFE genotyping results were also evaluated in view of the clinical data in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. 49 patients with MM were compared to 61 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) concerning the incidence of two genetic variants of the HFE gene (C282Y and H63D) identified with PCR-RFLP. Data of serum iron, transferrin saturation, consumed blood units and initial white blood cell counts (WBC) were analysed in relation to the HFE genotype status. 30 out of the 61 MDS patients (49%) and only 9 out of the 49 MM patients (20%) were positive for either HFE variant. Serum iron and transferrin saturation levels were all normal in MM and elevated in MDS patients. The initial WBC were significantly lower in the minority of MM patients who were at the same time heterozygous for the HFE gene variants. We found significant differences in the frequencies of the HFE genetic variants between MDS and MM patients with strong correlation to their iron metabolism. The low WBC in HFE positive MM patients unrelated to bone marrow infiltration rate might raise the suspicion of co-existent myelodysplasia.	17001480
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mixture models of serum iron measures in population screening for hemochromatosis and iron overload.	Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine	2006	4.56	Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the hemochromatosis gene on chromosome 6p (HFE) is a common genetic trait that increases susceptibility to iron overload. The authors describe and apply methodology developed for the analysis of phenotypic and genotypic data from 46,136 non-Hispanic Caucasians, a subset of the multi-ethnic cohort enrolled in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study. For analysis of the distribution of transferrin saturation (TS), mixtures of normal distributions were considered and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was applied for parameter estimation. Maximized log-likelihoods were compared, and significance was assessed by resampling. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values from the modeled subpopulations were compared with the actual observed genotypes for C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene. A strong association between HFE genotype and TS subpopulations was found in these data collected from different geographic regions, confirming the external validity of the statistical approach when applied to population-based data. It was concluded that mixture modeling of phenotypic data may provide a clinical guide for screening with gender-specific thresholds to identify potential samples for genetic testing.	17002922
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Risk of iron overload in carriers of genetic mutations associated with hereditary haemochromatosis: UK Food Standards Agency workshop.	The British journal of nutrition	2006	0.5	The UK Food Standards Agency convened a group of expert scientists to review current research investigating diet and carriers of genetic mutations associated with hereditary haemochromatosis. The workshop concluded that individuals who are heterozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene do not appear to respond abnormally to dietary Fe and therefore do not need to change their diet to prevent accumulation of body Fe.	17010238
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Isolated thrombosis due to the cystathionine beta-synthase mutation c.833T>C (1278T).	Journal of inherited metabolic disease	2003	3.54	Hereditary homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is a rare disease (about 1:20000 in Germany) often complicated by thromboembolism. Single mutations, which affect the C-terminal region of the CBS enzyme, lead to isolated thrombosis without further symptoms typical for homocystinuria such as atherosclerosis, psychomotor retardation, and dislocation of the ocular lenses. In this study, DNA samples of patients with stroke (n = 225) and sinus thrombosis (n = 46) were screened for the most common homocystinuria mutation, CBS 1278T. In each group one homozygous patient was identified. Thus, not only C-terminal mutations but also the most common mutation in classical homocystinuria, CBS 1278T, can lead to isolated thrombophilic events. These data support the hypothesis that homocystinuria is an underdiagnosed disease.	14518832
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis and transferrin receptor gene polymorphisms in chronic hepatitis C: impact on iron status, liver injury and HCV genotype.	Journal of molecular medicine (Berlin, Germany)	2003	0.5	Mild iron overload in chronic hepatitis C is associated with liver fibrosis, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection, and an impaired response to interferon therapy. In this study we evaluated whether polymorphisms in the hemochromatosis gene HFE and the transferrin receptor gene TFR1 are associated with these typical findings. The study considered 246 HCV-infected patients and 200 blood donors as controls, in which C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations ( HFE) and the S142G polymorphism ( TFR1) were detected. HCV genotype, serum ferritin levels, stainable intrahepatic iron, and grade of fibrosis according to the METAVIR score (F0-F4) were determined. In HCV-infected patients, heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation in HFE was significantly associated with elevated serum ferritin levels, stainable liver iron, and advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (F2-F4). By multivariate logistic regression analysis the odds ratio for the development of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis (F2-F4) was 2.5 for HCV-infected patients carrying a heterozygous C282Y mutation and 4.8 for HCV-infected patients with C282Y/H63D and C282Y/S65C compound heterozygosity. Heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation in HFE contributes to iron accumulation and fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis C.	14557859
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Inflammation in venous disease.	International angiology : a journal of the International Union of Angiology	2008	0.9	Chronic venous disease (CVD), mainly due to venous reflux or, sometimes, to venous outflow obstruction, produces a microcirculatory overload leading to the impairment of venous drainage. Venous drainage depends primarily on a major hemodynamic parameter called trans-mural pressure (TMP). TMP is increased in patients affected by CVD, leading to impaired tissue drainage, and, consequently, facilitating the beginning of the inflammatory cascade. Increased TMP determines red blood cell extravasation and either dermal hemosiderin deposits or iron laden-phagocytes. Iron deposits are readily visible in the legs of all patients affected by severe CVD. Local iron overload could generate free radicals or activate a proteolytic hyperactivity of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and/or downregulate tissue inhibitors of MMPs. These negative effects are particularly evident in carriers of the common HFE gene's mutations C282Y and H63D, because intracellular iron deposits of mutated macrophages have less stability than those of the wild type, inducing a significant oxidative stress. It has been demonstrated that such genetic variants increase the risk of ulcers and advance the age of ulcer onset, respectively. The iron-dependent vision of inflammation in CVD paves the way to new therapeutic strategies including the deliberate induction of iron deficiency as a treatment modality for non-healing and/or recurrent venous leg ulcers. The inflammatory cascade in CVD shares several aspects with that activated in the course of multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of unknown origin in which the impairment of cerebral venous outflow mechanisms has been recently demonstrated.	18974697
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Modifying factors of the HFE hemochromatosis phenotype.	Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology	2008	2.8	C282Y homozygosity is the only common HFE genotype able to produce a complete hemochromatosis phenotype. However, its biochemical penetrance is incomplete (75% in men and 50% in women) and its clinical penetrance is low, especially in women (1 vs 25% in men). Environmental (e.g., diet, alcohol, drugs and metabolic syndrome) and genetic (digenism, common polymorphisms in the bone morphogenetic protein pathway involved in the regulation of hepcidin synthesis) explain a part of the variability of the C282Y homozygous phenotype. All other common HFE genotypes--including C282Y-H63D compound heterozygosity--are not associated with significant biochemical and clinical expression in the absence of comorbid factors (e.g., alcohol, diabetes or steatohepatitis). Better identification of acquired and genetic modifiers of iron burden and iron-related organ damage is needed to improve the preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic management of HFE hemochromatosis.	19072401
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Variants in TF and HFE explain approximately 40% of genetic variation in serum-transferrin levels.	American journal of human genetics	2009	10.79	Only a small proportion of genetic variation in complex traits has been explained by SNPs from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We report the results from two GWASs for serum markers of iron status (serum iron, serum transferrin, transferrin saturation with iron, and serum ferritin), which are important in iron overload (e.g., hemochromatosis) and deficiency (e.g., anemia) conditions. We performed two GWASs on samples of Australians of European descent. In the first GWAS, 411 adolescent twins and their siblings were genotyped with 100K SNPs. rs1830084, 10.8 kb 3' of TF, was significantly associated with serum transferrin (p total association test = 1.0 x 10(-9); p within-family test = 2.2 x 10(-5)). In the second GWAS on an independent sample of 459 female monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs genotyped with 300K SNPs, we found rs3811647 (within intron 11 of TF, HapMap CEU r(2) with rs1830084 = 0.86) was significantly associated with serum transferrin (p = 3.0 x 10(-15)). In the second GWAS, we found two additional and independent SNPs on TF (rs1799852 and rs2280673) and confirmed the known C282Y mutation in HFE to be independently associated with serum transferrin. The three variants in TF (rs3811647, rs1799852 and rs2280673) plus the HFE C282Y mutation explained approximately 40% of genetic variation in serum transferrin (p = 7.8 x 10(-25)). These findings are potentially important for our understanding of iron metabolism and of regulation of hepatic protein secretion, and also strongly support the hypothesis that the genetic architecture of some endophenotypes may be simpler than that of disease.	19084217
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Correlation between HFE gene polymorphisms and increased risk of coronary artery disease among patients with type 2 diabetes in Iran.	Turkish journal of medical sciences	2016	0.32	Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are among the major causes of deaths in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The purpose of the present study was to determine the association of C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene with increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in T2D patients. Two hundred and ninety individuals were divided into two groups: a case group and a control group. Genomic DNA of peripheral venous blood cells was extracted and the HFE gene mutations were analyzed using the PCR-RFLP technique. Data analysis revealed a significant difference between the allele frequencies of H63D and C282Y mutations between the case group and the controls (P < 0.05). The relationships between the GA and GG genotypes in C282Y and H63D mutations in terms of fasting blood sugar (FBS), lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins), body mass index (BMI), HbA1c, micro albuminuria, and creatine levels did not show a significant differences between the two groups (P > 0.05). Using a logistic regression model, BMI, FBS, HDL, and total cholesterol levels were significantly different with independent predictors of CVD (P < 0.05). Our results revealed a significant correlation between C282Y and H63D mutations and the development of CAD in T2D patients.	27513231
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Rare HFE variants are the most frequent cause of hemochromatosis in non-c282y homozygous patients with hemochromatosis.	American journal of hematology	2016	5.0	p.Cys282Tyr (C282Y) homozygosity explains most cases of HFE-related hemochromatosis, but a significant number of patients presenting with typical type I hemochromatosis phenotype remain unexplained. We sought to describe the clinical relevance of rare HFE variants in non-C282Y homozygotes. Patients referred for hemochromatosis to the National Reference Centre for Rare Iron Overload Diseases from 2004 to 2010 were studied. Sequencing was performed for coding region and intronic flanking sequences of HFE, HAMP, HFE2, TFR2, and SLC40A1. Nine private HFE variants were identified in 13 of 206 unrelated patients. Among those, five have not been previously described: p.Leu270Argfs*4, p.Ala271Valfs*25, p.Tyr52*, p.Lys166Asn, and p.Asp141Tyr. Our results show that rare HFE variants are identified more frequently than variants in the other genes associated with iron overload. Rare HFE variants are therefore the most frequent cause of hemochromatosis in non-C282Y homozygote HFE patients. Am. J. Hematol. 91:1202-1205, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	27518069
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effect of HFE gene polymorphism on sustained virological response in patients with chronic hepatitis C and elevated serum ferritin.	Arquivos de gastroenterologia		0.5	Abnormal serum ferritin levels are found in approximately 20%-30% of the patients with chronic hepatitis C and are associated with a lower response rate to interferon therapy. To determine if the presence of HFE gene mutations had any effect on the sustained virological response rate to interferon based therapy in chronic hepatitis C patients with elevated serum ferritin. A total of 44 treatment naÏve patients with histologically demonstrated chronic hepatitis C, all infected with hepatitis C virus genotype non-1 (38 genotype 3; 6 genotype 2) and serum ferritin above 500 ng/mL were treated with interferon (3 MU, 3 times a week) and ribavirin (1.000 mg, daily) for 24 weeks. Sustained virological response was defined as negative qualitative HCV-RNA more than 24 weeks after the end of treatment. Serum HCV-RNA was measured by qualitative in house polymerase chain reaction with a limit of detection of 200 IU/mL. HFE gene mutation was detected using restriction-enzyme digestion with RsaI (C282Y mutation analysis) and BclI (H63D mutation analysis) in 16 (37%) patients, all heterozygous (11 H63D, 2 C282Y and 3 both). Sustained virological response was achieved in 0 of 16 patients with HFE gene mutations and 11 (41%) of 27 patients without HFE gene mutations (P = 0.002; exact Fisher test). Heterozigozity for H63D and/or C282Y HFE gene mutation predicts absence of sustained virological response to combination treatment with interferon and ribavirin in patients with chronic hepatitis C, non-1 genotype and serum ferritin levels above 500 ng/mL.	22481680
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	An association study of HFE gene mutation with idiopathic male infertility in the Chinese Han population.	Asian journal of andrology	2012	2.64	Mutations in the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) influence iron status in the general population of Northern Europe, and excess iron is associated with the impairment of spermatogenesis. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between three mutations (C282Y, H63D and S65C) in the HFE gene with idiopathic male infertility in the Chinese Han population. Two groups of Chinese men were recruited: 444 infertile men (including 169 with idiopathic azoospermia) and 423 controls with proven fertility. The HFE gene was detected using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. The experimental results demonstrated that no C282Y or S65C mutations were detected. Idiopathic male infertility was not significantly associated with heterozygous H63D mutation (odds ratio=0.801, 95% confidence interval=0.452-1.421, χ(2)=0.577, P=0.448). The H63D mutation frequency did not correlate significantly with the serum luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone (T) levels in infertile men (P=0.896, P=0.404 and P=0.05, respectively). Our data suggest that the HFE H63D mutation is not associated with idiopathic male reproductive dysfunction.	22504868
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Adapting iron dose supplementation in pregnancy for greater effectiveness on mother and child health: protocol of the ECLIPSES randomized clinical trial.	BMC pregnancy and childbirth	2014	2.18	Currently, there is no consensus regarding iron supplementation dose that is most beneficial for maternal and offspring health during gestation. Recommended iron supplementation dose does not preempt anemia in around 20% of the pregnancies, nor the risk of hemoconcentration in 15%. This deficit, or excess, of iron prejudices the mother-child wellbeing. Therefore the aims of the study are to determine the highest level of effectiveness of iron supplementation adapted to hemoglobin (Hb) levels in early pregnancy, which would be optimum for mother-child health.  Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) triple-blindedSetting: 10 Primary Care Centers from Catalunya (Spain)Study subjects: 878 non-anemic pregnant women at early gestation stage, and their subsequent newborns The study is structured as a RCT with 2 strata, depending on the Hb levels before week 12 of gestation. Stratum #1: If Hb from 110 to 130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement of 40 or 80 mg/d. Stratum #2: If Hb >130 g/L, randomly assigned at week 12 to receive iron supplement of 40 or 20 mg/d. In the mother: socio-economic data, clinical history, food item frequency, lifestyle and emotional state, and adherence to iron supplement prescription. Biochemical measurements include: Hb, serum ferritin, C reactive protein, cortisol, and alterations in the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D). In children: ultrasound fetal biometry, anthropometric measurements, and temperament development.Statistical analyses, using the SPSS program for Windows, will include bivariate and multivariate analyses adjusted for variables associated with the relationship under study. Should conclusive outcomes be reached, the study would indicate the optimal iron supplementation dose required to promote maternal and infant health. These results would contribute towards developing guidelines for good clinical practice.	24438754
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron absorption in male C282Y heterozygotes.	The American journal of clinical nutrition	2005	0.5	The suggestion that carriers of the HFE C282Y mutation absorb nonheme iron more efficiently than do carriers of the wild type has public health implications for countries where the C282Y mutation is common and foods are fortified with iron. We investigated the effect of C282Y heterozygosity on nonheme-iron absorption from a diet high in bioavailable iron and from iron-fortified cereals. The subjects were recruited from a parallel study investigating the relation between HFE mutations, habitual diet, and iron status. Iron absorption was measured in 15 wild-type carriers and 15 C282Y heterozygotes aged >/=40 y. Each subject consumed 3 meals of high iron bioavailability (labeled with Fe-57) for 2 d and 2 meals with fortified cereal products (labeled with Fe-54) for the next 3 d. Iron absorption was measured from isotope incorporation into red blood cells 14 d after the last labeled meal and was corrected for utilization of absorbed iron by means of an intravenous infusion of Fe-58. Absorption of Fe-57 with the high-iron-bioavailability diet was 6.8 +/- 6.8% (0.6 +/- 0.6 mg/d) in the wild-type carriers and 7.6 +/- 3.2% (0.7 +/- 0.3 mg/d) in the C282Y heterozygotes. Absorption of Fe-54 with cereal products was 4.9 +/- 2.0% (0.7 +/- 0.3 mg/d) in the wild-type carriers and 5.3 +/- 1.3% (0.8 +/- 0.2 mg/d) in the C282Y heterozygotes. There was no overall significant difference between C282Y heterozygotes and wild-type men in iron absorption from either dietary nonheme iron or fortified cereal products.	15817857
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic hemochromatosis update.	Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica		0.71	Hereditary Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease, characterized by chronic iron overload. It is mainly due to mutations of the HFE-1 gene. In the large majority of patients, the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at amino acid 282 (C282Y) is found at the homozygous state. Since the HFE-1 hemochromatosis identification, several other entities of iron overload have been individualized. In the present article, the frequency, penetrance and pathophysiology of HFE-1 hemochromatosis as well as various clinical presentations resulting from different mutations affecting different proteins involved in iron metabolism are described.	15832585
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The hemochromatosis C282Y allele: a risk factor for hepatic veno-occlusive disease after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.	Bone marrow transplantation	2005	3.64	Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD) is a serious complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Since the liver is a major site of iron deposition in HFE-associated hemochromatosis, and iron has oxidative toxicity, we hypothesized that HFE genotype might influence the risk of HVOD after myeloablative HSCT. We determined HFE genotypes in 166 HSCT recipients who were evaluated prospectively for HVOD. We also tested whether a common variant of the rate-limiting urea cycle enzyme, carbamyl-phosphate synthetase (CPS), previously observed to protect against HVOD in this cohort, modified the effect of HFE genotype. Risk of HVOD was significantly higher in carriers of at least one C282Y allele (RR=3.7, 95% CI 1.2-12.1) and increased progressively with C282Y allelic dose (RR=1.7, 95% CI 0.4-6.8 in heterozygotes; RR=8.6, 95% CI 1.5-48.5 in homozygotes). The CPS A allele, which encodes a more efficient urea cycle enzyme, reduced the risk of HVOD associated with HFE C282Y. We conclude that HFE C282Y is a risk factor for HVOD and that CPS polymorphisms may counteract its adverse effects. Knowledge of these genotypes and monitoring of iron stores may facilitate risk-stratification and testing of strategies to prevent HVOD, such as iron chelation and pharmacologic support of the urea cycle.	15834437
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE cross-talks with the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway.	Blood	2005	11.84	HFE is a protein known to be involved in iron metabolism; yet, other than its homology with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, it has not been described as having an immunologic function. Here we report that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) carrying the C282Y mutation in HFE have reduced cell-surface expression of MHC class I due to an enhanced endocytosis rate of MHC class I molecules caused by premature peptide and beta2-microglobulin dissociation. This faster turnover also leads to increased expression levels of cell-surface free class I heavy chains in mutant PBMCs. Biochemical analysis indicates an earlier peptide loading and endoplasmic reticulum maturation of MHC class I molecules in C282Y mutant cells. Thermostability assays further showed that in HFE mutants the MHC class I peptide loading gives rise to low-stability heterotrimers that dissociate prematurely during its intracellular traffic. The present results suggest the existence of an intriguing cross-talk between a particular HFE mutation and the classical MHC class I route. These findings constitute the first description of peptide presentation pathway abnormalities linked to HFE and provide additional evidence for the occurrence of immunologic defects in patients with HH.	15840699
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene knockout produces mouse model of hereditary hemochromatosis.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	1998	9.42	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disease characterized by increased iron absorption and progressive iron storage that results in damage to major organs in the body. Recently, a candidate gene for HH called HFE encoding a major histocompatibility complex class I-like protein was identified by positional cloning. Nearly 90% of Caucasian HH patients have been found to be homozygous for the same mutation (C282Y) in the HFE gene. To test the hypothesis that the HFE gene is involved in regulation of iron homeostasis, we studied the effects of a targeted disruption of the murine homologue of the HFE gene. The HFE-deficient mice showed profound differences in parameters of iron homeostasis. Even on a standard diet, by 10 weeks of age, fasting transferrin saturation was significantly elevated compared with normal littermates (96 +/- 5% vs. 77 +/- 3%, P < 0.007), and hepatic iron concentration was 8-fold higher than that of wild-type littermates (2,071 +/- 450 vs. 255 +/- 23 microg/g dry wt, P < 0.002). Stainable hepatic iron in the HFE mutant mice was predominantly in hepatocytes in a periportal distribution. Iron concentrations in spleen, heart, and kidney were not significantly different. Erythroid parameters were normal, indicating that the anemia did not contribute to the increased iron storage. This study shows that the HFE protein is involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis and that mutations in this gene are responsible for HH. The knockout mouse model of HH will facilitate investigation into the pathogenesis of increased iron accumulation in HH and provide opportunities to evaluate therapeutic strategies for prevention or correction of iron overload.	9482913
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A PCR-SSP method for detecting the Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene associated with hereditary haemochromatosis.	Molecular pathology : MP	1997	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis is a common genetic disorder that causes hyperabsorption of dietary iron, leading to increased deposition and various organic diseases. Early diagnosis is important if effective treatment is to be applied and the iron overload corrected before the onset of clinical symptoms. Recently, a candidate gene has been identified in which a single point mutation shows a very close association with hereditary haemochromatosis. A polymerase chain reaction method using sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) is described that, in conjunction with a simple DNA extraction method, would provide a specific diagnostic test or rapid screening procedure for this putative haemochromatosis associated mutation.	9497921
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Major histocompatibility complex class I associations in iron overload: evidence for a new link between the HFE H63D mutation, HLA-A29, and non-classical forms of hemochromatosis.	Immunogenetics	1998	2.3	The present study is an analysis of the frequencies of HFE mutations in patients with different forms of iron overload compared with the frequencies found in healthy subjects from the same region. The frequencies of HLA-A and -B antigens and HLA haplotypes were also analyzed in the same subjects. The study population included: 71 healthy individuals; 39 genetically and clinically well-characterized patients with genetic hemochromatosis (HH); and 25 patients with non-classical forms of iron overload (NCH), excluding secondary hemochromatosis. All subjects were HLA-typed and HFE-genotyped by the oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA). The gene frequencies found for the C282Y and H63D mutations of HFE were respectively: 0.03 and 0.23 in healthy individuals, 0.86 and 0.04 in HH patients, and 0.08 and 0.48 in NCH patients. An expected significant association between HH and HLA-A3 was observed, which was found to be in linkage disequilibrium with the C282Y mutation. A new association was seen, however, between HLA-A29 and NCH, in linkage disequilibrium with the H63D mutation. Again as expected, the HLA-B antigen B7 was associated with HH in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-A3. In addition, the HLA-B antigen B44 was found to be associated with NCH but not in linkage disequilibrium with either A29 or the H63D mutation. In conclusion, a new association of the HFE H63D mutation with forms of hemochromatosis other than HH and a new association between the HLA phenotype A29 and the HFE H63D mutation were found in the same patients. These findings reinforce evidence for the involvement of the major histocompatibility class I in iron metabolism, supporting the notion of a physiological role for the immunological system in the regulation of iron load.	9510559

Biochemistry research international	2011	0.5	The C282Y mutation of HFE accounts for the majority of cases of the iron overload disease Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH). The conformational changes introduced by this mutation impair the HFE association with β(2)-microglobulin (β(2)m) and the cell surface expression of the protein: with two major consequences. From a functional perspective, the ability of HFE to bind to transferrin receptors 1 and 2 is lost in the C282Y mutant, thus affecting hepcidin regulation. Also due to the faulty assembly with β(2)m, HFE-C282Y molecules remain in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as aggregates that undergo proteasomal degradation and activate an Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). UPR activation, regardless of the ER stress stimuli, was shown to reshape the expression profile of iron-related genes and to decrease MHC-I cell surface expression. The possibility of a HFE-C282Y-mediated interplay between the UPR and iron homeostasis influencing disease progression and the clinical heterogeneity among C282Y carriers is discussed. The responsiveness of the ER chaperone calreticulin to both ER and iron-induced oxidative stresses, and its correlation with HH patients' phenotype, reinforce the interest of dissecting the UPR signaling/iron metabolism crosstalk and points to the potential clinical value of use of pharmacological chaperones in HFE-HH.	21197476
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The influence of iron status and genetic polymorphisms in the HFE gene on the risk for postoperative complications after bariatric surgery: a prospective cohort study in 1,064 patients.	Patient safety in surgery	2011	0.5	Gastric bypass surgery is a highly effective therapy for long-term weight loss in severely obese patients, but carries significant perioperative risks including infection, wound dehiscence, and leaks from staple breakdown. Iron status can affect immune function and wound healing, thus may influence peri-operative complications. Common mutations in the HFE gene, the gene responsible for the iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis, may impact iron status. We analyzed 1064 extremely obese Caucasian individuals who underwent open and laparoscopic Roux-n-Y gastric bypass surgery at the Geisinger Clinic. Serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, and iron binding capacity were measured pre-operatively. All patients had intra-operative liver biopsies and were genotyped for the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene. Associations between surgical complications and serum iron measures, HFE gene status, and liver iron histology were determined. We found that increased serum iron and transferrin saturation were present in patients with any post-operative complication, and that increased serum ferritin was also increased in patients with major complications. Increased serum transferrin saturation was also associated with wound complications in open RYGB, and transferrin saturation and ferritin with prolonged lengths of stay. The presence of 2 or more HFE mutations was associated with overall complications as well as wound complications in open RYGB. No differences were found in complication rates between those with stainable liver iron and those without. Serum iron status and HFE genotype may be associated with complications following RYGB surgery in the extremely obese.	21219652
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron overload in HFE C282Y heterozygotes at first genetic testing: a strategy for identifying rare HFE variants.	Haematologica	2011	6.67	Heterozygotes for the p.Cys282Tyr (C282Y) mutation of the HFE gene do not usually express a hemochromatosis phenotype. Apart from the compound heterozygous state for C282Y and the widespread p.His63Asp (H63D) variant allele, other rare HFE mutations can be found in trans on chromosome 6. We performed molecular investigation of the genes implicated in hereditary hemochromatosis in six patients who presented with iron overload but were simple heterozygotes for the HFE C282Y mutation at first genetic testing. Functional impairment of new variants was deduced from computational methods including molecular modeling studies. We identified four rare HFE mutant alleles, three of which have not been previously described. One mutation is a 13-nucleotide deletion in exon 6 (c.1022_1034del13, p.His341_Ala345 > LeufsX119), which is predicted to lead to an elongated and unstable protein. The second one is a substitution of the last nucleotide of exon 2 (c.340G > A, p.Glu114Lys) which modifies the relative solvent accessibility in a loop interface. The third mutation, p.Arg67Cys, also lies in exon 2 and introduces a destabilization of the secondary structure within a loop of the α1 domain. We also found the previously reported c.548T > C (p.Leu183Pro) missense mutation in exon 3. No other known iron genes were mutated. We present an algorithm at the clinical and genetic levels for identifying patients deserving further investigation. Conclusions Our results suggest that additional mutations in HFE may have a clinical impact in C282Y carriers. In conjunction with results from previously described cases we conclude that an elevated transferrin saturation level and elevated hepatic iron index should indicate the utility of searching for further HFE mutations in C282Y heterozygotes prior to other iron gene studies.	21228038
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Two novel mutations, L490R and V561X, of the transferrin receptor 2 gene in Japanese patients with hemochromatosis.	Haematologica	2005	6.67	The low prevalence of the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in Japan means that the genetic background of hemochromatosis in Japanese patients remains unclear. In a previous report, we showed that 3 patients from one family had an AVAQ 594-597 deletion of the transferrin receptor (TfR2) gene. This suggests that the TfR2 gene is involved in hemochromatosis in Japanese patients. Nine patients clinically diagnosed with hemochromatosis were included in the study. DNA was extracted from whole blood samples collected with informed consent. The HFE and TfR2 genes were analyzed by sequencing the coding region and splicing sites. There were no mutations in the HFE gene. In the TfR2 gene, 2 novel mutations, 1469T->G (L490R) and 1665delC (V561X), were found in 2 patients. A known variation, 714C-> (I238M), was also found in the patient with L490R. The patient homozygous for both L490R and I238M presented with a mild manifestation of hemochromatosis at the age of 41 years. His liver was cirrhotic with parenchymal iron deposits and the result of a glucose tolerance test was compatible with diabetes mellitus. The patient homozygous for V561X had severe iron overload with the triad of cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus and skin pigmentation at the age of 58 years. Taken together with the previous report, 5 of our 12 patients with hemochromatosis manifesting in middle age had mutations in the TfR2 gene. Thus, TfR2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis in Japan.	15749661
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations in susceptibility to childhood leukemia: HuGE review.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics	2005	7.71	The hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) gene, HFE on chromosome 6p21.3, encodes a protein involved in iron homeostasis. HFE mutations have low penetrance with a mild effect on serum iron levels. Animal, twin, and population studies have shown that carrier state for C282Y can increase iron levels. A proportion of heterozygotes show slightly elevated serum iron levels. Increased serum iron has been suggested to increase the risk for oxidative damage to DNA. Epidemiologic studies established a correlation between iron levels and cancer risk. Case-control studies have reported associations between HFE mutations C282Y/H63D and several cancers, some of which in interaction with the transferrin receptor gene TFRC or dietary iron intake. Increased cancer risk in C282Y carriers is likely due to higher iron levels in a multifactorial setting. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), there is an association of C282Y with a gender effect in two British populations. No association has been found in acute myeloblastic leukemia and Hodgkin disease in adults. The childhood leukemia association possibly results from elevated intracellular iron in lymphoid cells increasing the vulnerability to DNA damage at a critical time window during lymphoid cell development. Interactions of HFE with environmental and genetic factors, most of which are recognized, may play a role in modification of susceptibility to leukemia conferred by C282Y. Given the population frequency of C282Y and the connection between iron and cancer, clarification of the mechanism of HFE associations in leukemia and cancer will have strong implications in public health.	15775751
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Erythrocytapheresis versus phlebotomy in the initial treatment of HFE hemochromatosis patients: results from a randomized trial.	Transfusion	2012	3.04	Standard treatment of newly diagnosed HFE hemochromatosis patients is phlebotomy. Erythrocytapheresis provides a new therapeutic modality that can remove up to three times more red blood cells per single procedure and could thus have a clinical and economic benefit. To compare the number of treatment procedures between erythrocytapheresis and phlebotomy needed to reach the serum ferritin (SF) target level of 50 µg/L, a two-treatment-arms, randomized trial was conducted in which 38 newly diagnosed patients homozygous for C282Y were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo either erythrocytapheresis or phlebotomy. A 50% decrease in the number of treatment procedures for erythrocytapheresis compared to phlebotomy was chosen as the relevant difference to detect. Univariate analysis showed a significantly lower mean number of treatment procedures in the erythrocytapheresis group (9 vs. 27; ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.45; Mann-Whitney p < 0.001). After adjustments for the two important influential factors initial SF level and body weight, the reduction ratio was still significant (0.43; 95% CI, 0.35-0.52; p < 0.001). Cost analysis showed no significant difference in treatment costs between both procedures. The costs resulting from productivity loss were significantly lower for the erythrocytapheresis group. Erythrocytapheresis is highly effective treatment to reduce iron overload and from a societal perspective might potentially also be a cost-saving therapy.	21848963
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of HFE (hemochromatosis) gene mutations in patients with cluster headache.	Headache	2005	2.96	To evaluate whether polymorphisms of the HFE gene would modify the occurrence and the clinical features of cluster headache (CH). Recent studies suggested that iron metabolism may be involved in the pathophysiology of primary headaches. The HFE gene encodes for a protein that modulates iron absorption. Mutations in this gene are responsible for toxic iron overload in several body organs. Genomic DNA was extracted from 109 CH patients and 211 age and sex-matched healthy controls and genotyped for the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. Allele and genotype frequencies of the HFE gene were compared between cases and controls. The clinical characteristics of the disease were compared according to the different HFE gene genotypes. No C282Y mutation was found in both cases and controls. The prevalence of the H63D mutation was nearly identical in cases and controls. The four patients carrying the HFE D63D genotype showed a significantly (P < .001) later age at onset of the disease in comparison with both H63H and H63D patients. The remaining clinical characteristics of the disease did not significantly differ in the presence or absence of the H63D mutation. Our data do not support the hypothesis that genetic variations within the HFE gene are associated with CH. However, the HFE gene may influence the disease phenotype and may be regarded as a disease modifier gene.	16178952
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Phlebotomy patterns in haemochromatosis patients and their contribution to the blood supply.	The New Zealand medical journal	2012	0.5	To determine venesection patterns in hereditary haemochromatosis (HC) patients in Christchurch, New Zealand, their contribution to the blood supply, and reasons for deferral. Review of clinical records of 412 HC patients venesected by the NZ Blood Service at least once during 2009. Of 275 males and 137 females, 384 had been tested for HFE gene mutations--76% were C282Y homozygotes, 12.8%, C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous, 8.6%, either H63D homozygotes, C282Y heterozygotes or H63D heterozygotes. Small numbers had no detectable mutations, were not iron overloaded but had been venesected for isolated hyperferritiniaemia. 53% were donors. C282Y homozygotes required significantly more venesections than patients of other genotypes. Eligible HC patients donated 3 units/donor/year compared to 1.63/person/year by healthy donors (p<0.001). HC patients contributed 3.4% of whole blood collections in 2009. There were 212 permanent or temporary donation deferrals--common reasons were abnormal liver functions, chronic or malignant disease, or immigration from vCJD risk countries. HC donors donate at nearly twice the rate of healthy donors but contribute only a small amount to the blood pool. Revision of selection criteria may increase this contribution without compromising blood safety.	22864154
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	High incidence of hemochromatosis gene mutations in the myelodysplastic syndrome: the Budapest Study on 50 patients.	Acta haematologica	2003	1.05	Genotypic testing of nonselected patients with the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) for the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis revealed a significantly increased frequency of these mutations when compared to healthy blood donors reflecting the average population. Among the 50 patients examined [26 refractory anemia (RA), 9 refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), 2 refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and 13 refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB-t)] there were 24 heterozygotes (20 for H63D and 4 for C282Y), 1 homozygote for H63D and 1 compound heterozygote. The difference between the HFE-positive and HFE-negative MDS patients as regards initial serum iron and transferrin saturation was not significant. Inevitably the iron overload syndrome eventually develops in MDS patients due to intrinsic characteristics of the disease as well as an escalating need for blood transfusion therapy in the course of the disease. The high incidence rate of HFE gene mutations among MDS patients may also contribute to this vicious circle.	12624489
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of C282Y mutation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and spondylarthritis.	International journal of tissue reactions	2002	0.5	Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory joint and systemic disease believed to be of autoimmune origin. Predisposing factors also include genetic factors, such as the presence of alleles HLA-DRB1 *04, (HLA-DRB1 *0401, *0404, *0405 and *0408) and, in other ethnic groups, of subtypes DRB1 *0101, *0102 and DRB1 *1001. These genetic factors are believed to raise the risk of developing the disease. In rheumatoid arthritis, as in other chronic inflammatory diseases, iron metabolism dysfunction has been observed and attributed to inflammation. In hereditary hemochromatosis, tissue sideropexia is associated with a peculiar form of arthropathy. C282Y is a point mutation involving the replacement of a cysteine with a tyrosine at position 282 of the HFE protein. When found in homozygosis, there is a close association with hereditary hemochromatosis, accounting for one of the causes of iron metabolism dysfunction observed in this disease. The aim of this study was to compare the frequency of C282Y in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with that in patients with different forms of spondylarthritis and to correlate these findings with iron metabolism parameters. In the group of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 2/24 (8.34%) were found to be positive for the C282Y mutation in the case of heterozygosis compared with 3/24 (12.5%) of patients with spondylarthritis. In patients with the C282Y mutation, ferritin levels were significantly higher than those in controls; conversely, serum iron levels were higher in patients with spondylarthritis. Serum transferrin levels, although slightly higher in rheumatoid arthritis patients, showed no statistically significant differences.	12635863
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of C282Y and E168X HFE mutations in an Italian population of Northern European ancestry.	Haematologica	2003	6.67	In Italy, the prevalence of C282Y is lower than in Northern European countries. We hypothesized a higher prevalence of C282Y in Northern than in Southern Italian populations. We previously identified a nonsense mutation (E168X) in hemochromatosis probands originating from a region in the north-west of Italy. We aimed to define the prevalence of C282Y and E168X in that region and the origin of the E168X mutation by haplotype analysis. Six-hundred and six blood donors were investigated for C282Y, H63D, S65C and E168X mutations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction assays. Three hundred were also tested for rare HFE and TFR2 mutations by reverse-hybridization test strips. D6S265, D6S105 and D6S1281 microsatellites were analyzed to define E168X 6p-associated haplotypes. One C282Y homozygote, thirteen C282Y/ H63D compound heterozygotes, four E168X heterozygotes and three E168X/H63D compound heterozygotes were found. The allele frequencies of C282Y, H63D, S65C, and E168X were 4.7%, 14.9%, 0.74% and 0.58%, respectively. The prevalence of C282Y in the region investigated was much higher than that previously reported in Italy. This finding is probably due to the heavy Celtic component of this north-western population and suggests that in populations of Northern Italian descent screening studies for hemochromatosis could be cost-effective. The prevalence of E168X in this region, although low, suggests that the mutation probably originated here many years ago and its frequency increased as a result of a local founder effect. Given its severity, we suggest that the E168X mutation should be searched for in all hemochromatosis patients of Northern ancestry with an incomplete HFE genotype.	12651261
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Porphyria cutanea tarda: multiplicity of risk factors including HFE mutations, hepatitis C, and inherited uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency.	Digestive diseases and sciences	2002	2.52	"""The coexistence of factors considered to contribute to development of porphyria cutanea tarda was studied in 39 consecutive patients. Highly prevalent factors were alcohol intake in 79%, smoking in 86%, hepatitis C virus infection in 74%, estrogen use in 73% of 11 females, and at least one mutation in the HFE (hereditary hemochromatosis) gene in 65%. The C282Y mutation was found in 29%, H63D in 47%, and S65C in 0%. HFE genotypes included C282Y/C282Y in 9%, H63D/H63D in 9%, C282Y/H63D in 12%, C282Y/wild type in 9%, and H63D/wild type in 26%. Less prevalent were HIV infection in 15% (or 25% of those tested, N = 24) and erythrocyte uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency, which distinguishes familial (type 2) from """"sporadic"""" (type 1) porphyria cutanea tarda, in 19%. Multiple contributing factors coexisted in both types 1 and 2, with 92% of all patients having three or more factors. These observations indicate that this porphyria is multifactorial in the individual patient, and therefore is seldom attributable to a single identifiable cause. Profiling for all potentially contributing factors is important for individualizing management."""	11855561
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between the MHC class I gene HFE polymorphisms and longevity: a study in Sicilian population.	Genes and immunity	2002	2.47	Classes I and II human leukocyte antigens (HLA) genes encode highly polymorphic heterodimeric glycoproteins involved in the control of immune responses. The HLA class I gene HFE seemingly no longer participates in immunity because it has lost its ability to bind peptides and it has acquired the ability to form complex with the receptor for iron-binding transferrin by regulating iron uptake by intestinal cells. Thus, it indirectly regulates immune responses too, because iron availability plays a role in specific and non-specific immune responses. The distribution of HFE polymorphisms in Sicilian centenarians and nonagenarians was studied to evaluate if HFE alleles might be represented differently in people selected for longevity. DNA samples were obtained from 106 young controls (age range from 22 to 55 years; 40 men and 66 women) and 35 elderly subjects (age range from 91 to 105 years; seven men and 28 women). Samples were typed for C282Y, H63D and S65C alleles using polymerase chain reaction and sequence specific primers. Among the young individuals, none was heterozygous for the C282Y or for S65C mutation. Twenty-six were heterozygous for H63D mutation. Among the elderly subjects, 11 were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation or for H63D mutation. None was heterozygous for the S65C mutation. No compound heterozygous individuals (C282Y/H63D) were found. A highly significant difference was observed in frequencies of C282Y alleles between the young and the elderly subjects on the whole. By analysing polymorphisms according to gender, heterozygous subjects for C282Y were found both in old men and in old women, but by comparing the allele frequencies to those of young people significance was attained only in women. Concerning H63D polymorphisms, no significant differences were observed, between old and young people, both in men and in women. Possession of C282Y allele, known to be associated with an increase of iron uptake, significantly increases women possibility to reach longevity. Thus, present data adds another piece of evidence to the complex puzzle of genetic and environmental factors involved in control of lifespan expectancy in humans.	11857056
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	H63D mutation in the HFE gene increases iron overload in beta-thalassemia carriers.	Haematologica	2002	6.67	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism. The HFE gene implicated in this disorder has been identified on chromosome 6 (6p21.3). The most prevalent mutation in HH patients changes the 282 cysteine residue to tyrosine (C282Y). The role of a second mutation which changes the 63 histidine to aspartic acid (H63D) in iron overload has been controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the H63D mutation on the ferritin levels of beta-thalassemia carriers. beta-thalassemia carriers have a tendency to increase iron absorption because of mild anemia and slightly increased erythropoiesis. Differences in ferritin levels between homozygotes for H63D and wild type may indicate a modulator effect of the HFE mutation on iron absorption. We studied 152 healthy males, heterozygous for beta-thalassemia. Serum ferritin was measured by chemiluminescence. H63D genotypes were determined by digestion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products with MboI restriction enzyme. Forty-five subjects were H63D heterozygotes and four subjects were H63D homozygotes. Ferritin levels were (mean +/- SD): 250 +/- 138 microg/L in homozygotes for the wild type H/H; 295 +/- 186 microg/L in H/D heterozygotes; and 389 +/- 75 microg/L in homozygotes for the mutation D/D. The difference in ferritin values between H/H and D/D is statistically significant (p=0.022). beta-thalassemia carriers who are homozygotes for the H63D mutation have higher ferritin levels than beta-thalassemia carriers with the H/H genotype, suggesting that the H63D mutation may have a modulating effect on iron absorption.	11869934
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A population-based study of the biochemical and clinical expression of the H63D hemochromatosis mutation.	Gastroenterology	2002	18.19	Two major mutations are defined within the hemochromatosis gene, HFE. Although the effects of the C282Y mutation have been well characterized, the effects of the H63D mutation remain unclear. We accessed a well-defined population in Busselton, Australia, and determined the frequency of the H63D mutation and its influence on total body iron stores. Serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels were correlated with the H63D mutation in 2531 unrelated white subjects who did not possess the C282Y mutation. Sixty-two subjects (2.1%) were homozygous for the H63D mutation, 711 (23.6%) were heterozygous, and 1758 (58.4%) were wild-type for the H63D mutation. Serum transferrin saturation was significantly increased in male and female H63D homozygotes and heterozygotes compared with wild-types. Serum ferritin levels within each gender were not influenced by H63D genotypes. Elevated transferrin saturation > or = 45% was observed in a greater proportion of male H63D carriers than male wild-types. Male H63D homozygotes (9%) and heterozygotes (3%) were more likely to have both elevated transferrin saturation and elevated ferritin > or = 300 ng/mL than male wild-types (0.7%). Homozygosity for H63D was not associated with the development of clinically significant iron overload. Presence of the H63D mutation results in a significant increase in serum transferrin saturation but does not result in significant iron overload. In the absence of the C282Y mutation, the H63D mutation is not clinically significant.	11874997
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A homozygous HFE gene splice site mutation (IVS5+1 G/A) in a hereditary hemochromatosis patient of Vietnamese origin.	Gastroenterology	2002	18.19	The vast majority of Caucasian patients presenting with hereditary hemochromatosis demonstrate a single homozygous missense mutation in the HFE gene (C282Y). The underlying genetic defects in hemochromatosis patients of non-Caucasian origin are largely unknown. A 48-year-old man of Vietnamese origin presented with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, tertiary adrenocortical insufficiency, and laboratory results highly indicative of hereditary hemochromatosis. Because the patient was negative for the known HFE gene mutations C282Y, H63D, and S65C HFE, the entire coding region and intron/exon boundaries of the HFE gene was investigated. Sequencing studies identified a homozygous G-to-A transition at position +1 of intron 5 (IVS5+1 G/A). This newly described mutation alters the invariant G at position +1 of the 5' splice site causing altered mRNA splicing and exon skipping with exon 4 being spliced to exon 6. Both heterozygously affected children (age 19 and 20 years) had moderately increased ferritin levels with normal serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation. The newly described mutation was not detected in a control group consisting of 220 Caucasian individuals as verified by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. We describe for the first time a homozygous HFE splice site mutation (IVS5+1 G/A) in a non-Caucasian patient with hereditary hemochromatosis. Although the absence of this novel HFE gene mutation in Caucasian subjects suggests that the mutation is exclusive to this family, mutation screening in populations of different ethnic background is recommended to precisely define its contribution to hereditary hemochromatosis in non-Caucasian patients.	11875012
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Molecular basis of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency in pyridoxine responsive and nonresponsive homocystinuria.	Human molecular genetics	1993	5.99	Cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with multisystem clinical disease. We analyzed PCR amplified products from patients' RNA and genomic DNA. Direct sequencing of the entire coding region of the CBS gene revealed a G-919 to A transition in exon 8, resulting in replacement of Gly 307 by Ser (G307S) in the protein. The mutation was detected in one allele of patient L171 of French/Scottish ancestry and in both alleles of patient L198 of Irish ancestry. Amplifying and sequencing exon 8 from the genomic DNA showed that both parents of L198 were heterozygotes for G307S. The pathogenicity of the mutation was demonstrated in an expression experiment. The mutant protein was apparently stable in E.coli extracts and lacked catalytic activity. Sequencing of exon 8 revealed the G307S mutation in five additional families. All patients have pyridoxine nonresponsive homocystinuria. We have now observed this mutation in 9 of 52 apparently unrelated alleles of varied ethnic backgrounds. All 9 are from patients with Celtic (Irish/English/Scottish/French) ancestry in either one or both parents. The G307S mutation was detected in 50% (9 of 18) of the Celtic alleles in our series. The second mutation found in exon 8 is the I278T mutation, which was described previously in one allele of a pyridoxine responsive patient. This missense mutation was detected in one allele of a pyridoxine nonresponsive patient and in both alleles of a pyridoxine responsive patient. The latter suggests that I278T is probably associated with pyridoxine responsiveness.	7506602
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mass spectrometry measurement of plasma hepcidin for the prediction of iron overload.	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	2011	3.02	Hepcidin has emerged as the primary regulator of iron homeostasis. Previous studies on assessing urinary hepcidin are limited. We developed a method for quantifying hepcidin-25 (Hep-25) in plasma using surface-enhanced laser-desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF/MS) and a 25-AA peptide as reference standard. The aims of the study were 1) to assess the performance of this method in different conditions of iron metabolism disorders; 2) to assess the diagnostic validity of non-invasive serum biomarkers in the identification of iron overload. Validation of the method was performed in 10 patients with type I hemochromatosis (HE) and in 177 subjects previously enrolled in a general population epidemiological study. Among the latter group, 17 had non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, 10 had chronic hepatitis C, and 150 subjects had normal ultrasound, normal liver function tests (LFTs), an alcohol intake < 20 g ethanol/day and were negative for the C282Y mutation. The following biomarkers were assayed in each case: plasma Hep-25, C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene; serum iron, ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation, transaminases, γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides. Plasma Hep-25 concentrations were higher in HCV+ patients (26.3 ± 7.2 nmol/L) than in controls, and correlated positively with SF (p < 0.001). H63D heterozygous subjects revealed a pattern of iron overload that was significantly higher than H63D wild type subjects. Analyzing the data with the Biomarker Pattern 5.0.2. software to identify the most significant biomarkers for discriminating between HE cases and controls allowed us to produce an algorithm with four terminal nodes, which included glucose > 4.8 mmol/L and Hep-25/SF ratio ≤ 6.6 as the main splitters. These variables enabled the correct diagnosis of HE with 100% sensitivity, 93% specificity and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.993. Our plasma Hep-25 mass spectrometry method yields measurements that reflect pathological and genetic influences; simple non-invasive biomarkers (Hep-25/SF ratio and glucose) can predict the presence of HE.	21143008
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of the hemochromatosis HFE mutations C282Y, H63D, and S65C in blood donors in the Faroe Islands.	Annals of hematology	2005	3.02	The aim of the study was to assess the frequencies of the hereditary hemochromatosis HFE mutations C282Y, H63D, and S65C in the population in the Faroe Islands. The series comprised 200 randomly selected blood donors of Faroese heritage. The frequency of the C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations on the HFE gene was assessed by genotyping using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and calculated from direct allele counting. We found no C282Y homozygous subjects; 28 (14.0%) subjects were C282Y heterozygous and four subjects were C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous (2.0%). The C282Y allele frequency was 8.0% (95% CI 5.3-10.7%). The series contained three (1.5%) H63D homozygous subjects and 60 (30.0%) H63D heterozygous subjects. The H63D allele frequency was 17.5% (95% CI 13.8-21.2%). There were four (2.0%) S65C heterozygous subjects. The S65C allele frequency was 1.0% (95% CI 0.3-2.5%). The frequency of the C282Y mutation is high in Faroese blood donors, being close to and not significantly different from the frequencies reported in other Scandinavian countries: Denmark 5.7%, Norway 6.6%, Iceland 5.1%, and Sweden 6.1%. The frequency of the H63D mutation in Faroese subjects is significantly higher than the frequency in Denmark 12.8% (p=0.007), Iceland 10.9% (p=0.003), and Sweden 12.4% (p=0.015), but not from the frequency in Norway 11.2% (p=0.063). The frequency of the S65C mutation in Faroese subjects is not significantly different from the frequencies in Denmark 1.5% and Sweden 1.6%. Screening of larger groups of the Faroese population for HFE mutations especially C282Y should be considered in order to establish the penetrance.	15042317
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A tale of two sisters.	Journal of clinical pathology	2004	2.91	Hereditary haemochromatosis is the most common inherited disorder in white populations, whereas non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is becoming the most common reason for referral for investigation of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). This report describes two sisters, from similar environments, who were referred to the clinic after being found to be C282Y homozygotes and to have abnormal LFTs. One sister had developed features of haemochromatosis and the other had developed NASH. These cases illustrate the potential non-penetrance of HFE gene mutations and the need to investigate abnormal LFTs fully, even when there is a positive genetic test at the outset.	15047754
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Synergy between the C2 allele of transferrin and the C282Y allele of the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) as risk factors for developing Alzheimer's disease.	Journal of medical genetics	2004	5.65	There is evidence that iron may play a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There may be genetic factors that contribute to iron deposition resulting in tissue damage thus exacerbating AD. We have genotyped 269 healthy elderly controls, 191 cases with definite or probable AD, and 69 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from the OPTIMA cohort. We have examined the interaction between the C2 variant of the transferrin (TF) gene and the C282Y allele of the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene as risk factors for developing AD. Our results showed that each of the two variants was associated with an increased risk of AD only in the presence of the other. Neither allele alone had any effect. Carriers of both variants were at 5 times greater risk of AD compared with all others. The interaction was significant by logistic regression (p = 0.014) and by synergy factor analysis (p = 0.015, synergy factor = 5.1). Further, carriers of these two alleles plus apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4) were at still higher risk of AD: of the 14 tri-carriers of the three variants, identified in this study, 12 had AD and two MCI. We suggest that the combination of TF C2 and HFE C282Y may lead to an excess of redox-active iron and the induction of oxidative stress in neurones, which is exacerbated in carriers of APOE4. Since 4% of Northern Europeans carry the two iron-related variants and since iron overload is a treatable condition, these results merit replication.	15060098
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	High prevalence of non-HFE gene-associated haemochromatosis in patients from southern Italy.	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	2004	3.02	Hereditary haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron regulation that results in abnormal intestinal iron absorption with progressive iron overloading of parenchymal cells. Two specific, single point mutations of the HFE gene (C282Y and H63D) have been described in haemochromatosis patients. Epidemiological studies have revealed a strict association between hereditary haemochromatosis and C282Y homozygosis or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosis, suggesting that these mutations may provide a useful tool for diagnosis. However, recent investigations from southern Europe have reported lower allelic frequencies of the C282Y mutation among haemochromatosis patients, apparently depending on the geographical area of the population analysed. To assess the predictive value of the detection of the C282Y and H63D HFE mutations in our geographical area, we have evaluated their occurrence in 46 haemochromatosis patients from southern Italy. We found that only 19.6% of our patients were homozygous for the C282Y mutation and 21.7% were compound C282Y/H63D heterozygotes. Among the remaining 59%, approximately 40% did not display any of the known HFE mutations. We conclude that, in southern Italy, another genetic determinant/s must be responsible for many haemochromatosis cases and that a genetic screening for the C282Y and H63D HFE mutations is not sufficient for hereditary haemochromatosis diagnosis.	15061375
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis mutations in the general population: iron overload progression rate.	Blood	2004	11.84	The progression rate of iron overload in hereditary hemochromatosis in individuals in the general population is unknown. We therefore examined in the general population iron overload progression rate in C282Y homozygotes. Using a cohort study of the Danish general population, The Copenhagen City Heart Study, we genotyped 9174 individuals. The 23 C282Y homozygotes identified were matched to 2 subjects each of 5 other HFE genotypes with respect to sex, age, and alcohol consumption. As a function of biologic age, transferrin saturation increased from 50% to 70% from 25 to 85 years of age and from 70% to 80% from 35 to 80 years of age in female and male C282Y homozygotes, respectively. Equivalently, ferritin levels increased from 100 to 500 microg/L and decreased from 800 to 400 microg/L in female and male C282Y homozygotes. As a function of 25 years follow-up irrespective of age, transferrin saturation and ferritin levels increased slightly in male and female C282Y homozygotes. None of the C282Y homozygotes developed clinically overt hemochromatosis. In conclusion, individuals in the general population with C282Y homozygosity at most demonstrate modest increases in transferrin saturation and ferritin levels, and clinically overt hemochromatosis is rare. Therefore, C282Y homozygotes identified during population screening, and not because of clinically overt hemochromatosis, at most need to be screened for manifestations of hemochromatosis every 10 to 20 years.	15070663
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HLA-A and -B alleles and haplotypes in hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity in central Alabama.	BMC medical genetics	2002	2.09	We wanted to quantify HLA-A and -B allele and haplotype frequencies in Alabama hemochromatosis probands with HFE C282Y homozygosity and controls, and to compare results to those in other populations. Alleles were detected using DNA-based typing (probands) and microlymphocytotoxicity (controls). Alleles were determined in 139 probands (1,321 controls) and haplotypes in 118 probands (605 controls). In probands, A*03 positivity was 0.7482 (0.2739 controls; p = or < 0.0001; odds ratio (OR) 7.9); positivity for B*07, B*14, and B*56 was also increased. In probands, haplotypes A*03-B*07 and A*03-B*14 were more frequent (p < 0.0001, respectively; OR = 12.3 and 11.1, respectively). The haplotypes A*01-B*60, A*02-B*39, A*02-B*62, A*03-B*13, A*03-B*15, A*03-B*27, A*03-B*35, A*03-B*44, A*03-B*47, and A*03-B*57 were also significantly more frequent in probands. 37.3% of probands were HLA-haploidentical with other proband(s). A*03 and A*03-B*07 frequencies are increased in Alabama probands, as in other hemochromatosis cohorts. Increased absolute frequencies of A*03-B*35 have been reported only in the present Alabama probands and in hemochromatosis patients in Italy. Increased absolute frequencies of A*01-B*60, A*02-B*39, A*02-B*62, A*03-B*13, A*03-B*15, A*03-B*27, A*03-B*44, A*03-B*47, and A*03-B*57 in hemochromatosis cohorts have not been reported previously.	12370085
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mild iron overload in patients carrying the HFE S65C gene mutation: a retrospective study in patients with suspected iron overload and healthy controls.	Gut	2002	14.92	The role of the HFE S65C mutation in the development of hepatic iron overload is unknown. The aim of the present study was: (A) to determine the HFE S65C frequency in a Northern European population; and (B) to evaluate whether the presence of the HFE S65C mutation would result in a significant hepatic iron overload. Biochemical iron parameters and HFE mutation analysis (for the C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations) were analysed in 250 healthy control subjects and collected retrospectively in 296 patients with suspected iron overload (elevated serum ferritin and/or transferrin saturation). The frequency of patients having at least mild iron overload, and mean serum ferritin and transferrin saturation values were calculated for each HFE genotype. For patients carrying the S65C mutation, clinical data, liver biopsy results, and amount of blood removed at phlebotomy were determined. The HFE S65C mutation was found in 14 patients and eight controls. In controls, the S65C allele frequency was 1.6%. The S65C allele frequency was enriched in non-C282Y non-H63D chromosomes from patients (4.9%) compared with controls (1.9%) (p<0.05). Serum ferritin was significantly increased in controls carrying the S65C mutation compared with those without HFE mutations. Fifty per cent of controls and relatives having the S65C mutation had elevated serum ferritin levels or transferrin saturation. The number of iron overloaded patients was significantly higher among those having HFE S65C compared with those without any HFE mutation. Half of patients carrying the S65C mutation (7/14) had evidence of mild or moderate hepatic iron overload but no signs of extensive fibrosis in liver biopsies. Screening of relatives revealed one S65C homozygote who had no signs of iron overload. Compound heterozygosity with S65C and C282Y or H63D did not significantly increase the risk of iron overload compared with S65C heterozygosity alone. The HFE S65C mutation may lead to mild to moderate hepatic iron overload but neither clinically manifest haemochromatosis nor iron associated extensive liver fibrosis was encountered in any of the patients carrying this mutation.	12377814
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Prevalence of hemochromatosis-associated mutations in the hemochromatosis gene in the Danish population].	Ugeskrift for laeger	2002	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive condition characterised by systemic iron overload. In Northern Europe, 85-90% of patients with haemochromatosis are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. In the present study, we determined the prevalence of the haemochromatosis-associated mutations, C282Y and H63D, in the Danish general population. We genotyped 9174 individuals from a random sample of the Danish general population (The Copenhagen City Heart Study), stratified by gender and age in 10-year age groups, for the presence of C282Y and H63D. In The Copenhagen City Heart Study, 0.25% (95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.38%) were homozygous for C282Y, 1.4% (1.2-1.7%) were compound heterozygous for C282Y/H63D, and 9.2% (8.6-9.9%) were heterozygous for C282Y alone. Accordingly, the allele frequencies of C282Y and H63D in the Danish population were 5.6% (5.3-5.9%) and 12.7% (12.2-13.2%). All in all, more than 10% of the Danish population are either homozygous or heterozygous for C282Y, whereas about 24% are either homozygous or heterozygous for H63D. A prevalence of 0.25% homozygotes and > 10% heterozygotes for C282Y makes hereditary haemochromatosis the potentially most common inherited disorder in Denmark. However, in new studies from USA of the association between genotype and disease in unselected populations the penetrance is very low. On this background, population screening for the presence of these mutations is not advisable.	12380399
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis.	Seminars in hematology	2002	4.44	"""Hereditary hemochromatosis (hh, type 1 hemochromatosis) is an autosomal recessive trait characterized by hyperabsorption of dietary iron. The disease trait occurs in approximately five per thousand Caucasians of northern European descent. The causative gene, designated HFE, was isolated and characterized in 1996; most individuals with hh are homozygous for a mutation resulting in a change from cysteine to tyrosine at residue 282 of the HFE protein (C282Y). Wild-type HFE protein binds to the transferrin receptor, and by an undefined mechanism the enterocyte is """"programmed"""" to absorb an amount of dietary iron precisely matched to the body's needs. The C282Y mutant protein is not expressed on the cell surface and does not bind to the transferrin receptor; the result is an enterocyte programmed to absorb slightly more iron than required. Most individuals with hh display a common laboratory phenotype, an elevated transferrin saturation. Iron stores in excess of normal eventually occur in most men and some women. The prevalence of organ damage due to iron overload, however, remains a controversial issue. Published estimates range from less than 1% to """"nearly all."""" The main reason for this discrepancy has been ascertainment bias. Retrospective studies have been biased in favor of individuals with morbid complications of hh, whereas screening studies of groups such as blood donors generally include only healthy subjects. We focus here on a review of studies that have attempted to avoid ascertainment bias. If biopsy-proven hepatic fibrosis and/or cirrhosis is employed as the single criterion for disease-related morbidity, clinical penetrance of hh occurs in 4% to 25% of homozygotes. This range, although narrower than in biased studies, is still wide and requires clarification. A large-scale population-based study has been sponsored by the National Institutes of Health to address this issue. Until results become available, the pragmatic approach is to continue to screen for hemochromatosis in the primary care setting and to maintain serum ferritin values at approximately 100 micro g/L or lower with phlebotomy therapy."""	12382198
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: detection of C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE gene by means of guthrie cards in population of Czech Republic.	Genetic epidemiology	2002	2.55	The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of HFE gene mutations in the population of the Czech Republic. Altogether, 257 randomly selected newborn screening cards (Guthrie cards) were analyzed for the C282Y and H63D mutations within the HFE gene. Complete results were obtained from 254 cards for the C282Y mutation and 257 cards for the H63D mutation. No sample was identified as homozygous for C282Y, and two (0.78%) were homozygous for H63D. Twenty (7.87%) samples were C282Y-heterozygous, and 69 (26.84%) were H63D-heterozygous. Of these, two (0.79%) carried one copy of each mutation, i.e., were compound heterozygous. Allele frequencies for C282Y and H63D were 0.039 and 0.142, respectively. The observed genotype frequencies for both C282Y and H63D mutations in the Czech Republic are in the range of values reported for other Central and Western European populations.	12384978
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations in the HFE gene and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis risk: a meta-analysis of observational studies.	Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas	2014	0.5	Iron homeostasis dysregulation has been regarded as an important mechanism in neurodegenerative diseases. The H63D and C282Y polymorphisms in the HFE gene may be involved in the development of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through the disruption of iron homeostasis. However, studies investigating the relationship between ALS and these two polymorphisms have yielded contradictory outcomes. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the roles of the H63D and C282Y polymorphisms of HFE in ALS susceptibility. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. Strict selection criteria and exclusion criteria were applied. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess the strength of associations. A fixed- or random-effect model was selected, depending on the results of the heterogeneity test. Fourteen studies were included in the meta-analysis (six studies with 1692 cases and 8359 controls for C282Y; 14 studies with 5849 cases and 13,710 controls for H63D). For the C282Y polymorphism, significant associations were observed in the allele model (Y vs C: OR=0.76, 95%CI=0.62-0.92, P=0.005) and the dominant model (YY+CY vs CC: OR=0.75, 95%CI=0.61-0.92, P=0.006). No associations were found for any genetic model for the H63D polymorphism. The C282Y polymorphism in HFE could be a potential protective factor for ALS in Caucasians. However, the H63D polymorphism does not appear to be associated with ALS.	24604426
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) in 2501 ethnic Danes.	Annals of hematology	2004	3.02	The aim of the study was to assess the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) in ethnic Danes. The series comprised 2501 subjects (1284 men) of Danish heritage who were drawn at random from the Census Registry in age cohorts of 30, 40, 50, and 60 years. The frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations was assessed on blood samples by genotyping using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The HFE genotype distribution was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p=0.85). C282Y mutation: 9 subjects (0.36%) were homozygous and 265 subjects (10.6%) were heterozygous. H63D mutation: 40 subjects (1.6%) were homozygous and 584 subjects (23.4%) were heterozygous. C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity was found in 36 subjects (1.4%). The C282Y allele frequency was 5.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.0-6.3%] and the H63D allele frequency was 13.3% (95% CI 12.3-14.2%). In conclusion, the C282Y frequency is relatively high in the Danes, being close to the frequency in other Scandinavian countries, i.e., Iceland 5.1%, the Faroe Islands 6.6%, and Sweden 5.7%, but significantly lower than in Norway 6.6% (p=0.02). Also, the H63D frequency in Danes is close to and not significantly different from the frequency in Iceland 10.9%, Norway 11.2%, and Sweden 12.4%, but significantly lower than in the Faroe Islands 15.4% (p=0.046).	15141324
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Early onset hereditary hemochromatosis resulting from a novel TFR2 gene nonsense mutation (R105X) in two siblings of north French descent.	British journal of haematology	2004	5.4	The molecular basis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is more complex than previously expected. More than 80% of hemochromatosis probands of Northern European descent are homozygous for the C282Y HFE gene mutation. However, five novel non-related-HFE HH forms have now been identified. The transferrin receptor(TFR2)-linked form is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is considered to be an adult-onset syndrome. Until now, it has been associated with five mutations that have only been detected in Japanese and southern European patients. Here, we report the identification of a novel TFR2 nonsense mutation in two related French adolescents. We discuss the phenotype of this sibling pair from precedent biological and clinical findings as well as the expected role of TFR2 in iron homeostasis. Finally, we suggest that iron overload phenotypes associated with mutations in TFR2 may be intermediate between those related to mutations in HFE and those related to mutations in juvenile hemochromatosis genes.	15147384
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Nontransferrin-bound iron uptake by hepatocytes is increased in the Hfe knockout mouse model of hereditary hemochromatosis.	Blood	2004	11.84	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an iron-overload disorder caused by a C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. In HH, plasma nontransferrin-bound iron (NTBI) levels are increased and NTBI is bound mainly by citrate. The aim of this study was to examine the importance of NTBI in the pathogenesis of hepatic iron loading in Hfe knockout mice. Plasma NTBI levels were increased 2.5-fold in Hfe knockout mice compared with control mice. Total ferric citrate uptake by hepatocytes isolated from Hfe knockout mice (34.1 +/- 2.8 pmol Fe/mg protein/min) increased by 2-fold compared with control mice (17.8 +/- 2.7 pmol Fe/mg protein/min; P <.001; mean +/- SEM; n = 7). Ferrous ion chelators, bathophenanthroline disulfonate, and 2',2-bipyridine inhibited ferric citrate uptake by hepatocytes from both mouse types. Divalent metal ions inhibited ferric citrate uptake by hepatocytes, as did diferric transferrin. Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) mRNA and protein expression was increased approximately 2-fold by hepatocytes from Hfe knockout mice. We conclude that NTBI uptake by hepatocytes from Hfe knockout mice contributed to hepatic iron loading. Ferric ion was reduced to ferrous ion and taken up by hepatocytes by a pathway shared with diferric transferrin. Inhibition of uptake by divalent metals and up-regulation of DMT1 expression suggested that NTBI uptake was mediated by DMT1.	15155457
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepatic iron concentration does not predict response to standard and pegylated-IFN/ribavirin therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C.	Journal of hepatology	2004	10.59	Iron overload is common among patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). In this study the role of hepatic iron concentration (HIC) and serum iron parameters was assessed to determine response to standard and pegylated interferon (IFN)/ribavirin combination therapy in patients with CHC. Liver biopsies were obtained from 169 IFN-naïve patients (m=115, f=54, age: 40.8+/-10.7) with CHC. 140 patients were treated with standard IFN/ribavirin, 29 patients with pegylated-IFN/ribavirin. Biopsy specimens were evaluated according to the DiBisceglie scoring system and iron grading. HIC was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Ferritin and transferrin saturation and presence of HFE-C282Y and H63D gene mutations were determined at baseline. Nonresponders to combination therapy had higher serum ferritin levels at baseline (p<0.01). There was no difference of HIC, transferrin saturation levels, and the HFE-mutation status between responders and nonresponders. Logistic regression analysis revealed serum ferritin as an independent predictor of response. HIC correlated with the DiBisceglie score (r=0.352, p<0.001), iron grading (r=0.352, p<0.001) and serum ferritin (r=0.335, P<0.001). Pretreatment liver iron concentration does not predict response to combination therapy in patients with CHC. In contrast, high baseline serum ferritin levels are predictors of poor response to antiviral therapy.	15158344
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Idiopathic hemochromatosis with the mutation of Ala176Val heterozygous for HFE gene.	Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)	2001	0.5	Most patients with hereditary hemochromatosis are homozygous for C282Y in the HFE gene in populations of Celtic origin, but the genetic cause of this disease is unknown in Japan because of its rarity. A 48-year-old Japanese patient was recently diagnosed with idiopathic hemochromatosis. Analysis of the entire coding region of the patient's HFE by RT-PCR showed a heterozygous nucleotide substitution at nucleotide 527 from C to T, which resulted in A176V amino acid substitution. Another mutation at nucleotide 942 from T to C was observed, but this was a nonsense mutation. C282Y and another mutation, H63D, were not found in the patient. The mutation may have a possible role on the cause of hemochromatosis in this Japanese case.	11446670
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Analysis of haemochromatosis gene mutations in a population from the Mediterranean Basin.	Liver	2001	0.5	The C282Y mutation in the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) located on chromosome 6 has been identified as the main genetic basis of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). Two more mutations of that gene, H63D and S65C, appear to be associated with milder forms of HH. A high allele frequency for C282Y and H63D mutations was reported in populations from North Europe, while incomplete information is available for individuals from the Mediterranean Basin where C282Y homozygotes comprise a smaller percentage of HH cases. In this study we investigated the allele frequency of HFE mutations and the association between HFE mutations and cases of HH in a population from the South of Italy (Sicily and Calabria). In addition, we evaluated a possible association between HFE mutations and either chronic liver disease or type II diabetes. Three hundred and twenty-seven individuals (654 chromosomes) were tested for C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations of the HFE gene by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Four had HH, 23 had hepatocellular carcinoma, 100 had chronic liver disease, 100 had type II diabetes, and 100 were healthy controls. Both C282Y and S65C mutations were each detected in one of the 654 chromosomes analysed (allele frequency=0.15%), while H63D change was found in 122 chromosomes (allele frequency=18.6%) and was equally distributed in all the categories examined. One healthy individual had compound heterozygosity for C282Y and H63D mutations. The frequency of C282Y in this Southern Italian sample was the lowest yet reported for a population of European origin. None of the four HH patients was either homozygous or heterozygous for C282Y. In Mediterranean populations from Southern Italy the C282Y mutation occurs sporadically and HFE polymorphisms seem to have little diagnostic relevance.	11454185
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis: iron still matters.	Internal medicine journal		1.53	Our ability to detect those predisposed to haemochromatosis is greatly enhanced by testing for HFE mutations. Ironically, this diagnostic advance has led to some confusion regarding the criteria for diagnosis of haemochromatosis, with overreliance on genetic testing instead of investigations for iron overload. Because many people who are homozygous for the C282Y mutation, or compound heterozygous for the C282Y and H63D mutations, either do not express or only partially express the disease, it is essential to confirm a diagnosis of haemochromatosis on the basis of increased body iron stores. Liver biopsy remains the best method of confirming this and has an important role in the patient with either borderline iron overload or advanced disease. Persistent elevation of serum ferritin concentration in the absence of overt liver damage, inflammation or neoplasia, and estimation of mobilized body iron by repeated phlebotomy, are reasonable alternatives to liver biopsy. Although the precise definition of iron overload is debated, a diagnosis of haemochromatosis cannot be made without demonstrating increased body iron stores.	11456037

Two sites of point mutations in the HFE gene--C282Y and H63D--are associated with greater than 90% of HH cases. We have developed a sensitive real time PCR (TaqMan) 5'-nuclease assay for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection using novel DNA chemistry, and successfully applied this method to detect these mutations. Fluorogenic PCR probes, chemically modified with a minor groove binding agent to increase duplex stability, were used in single and multiplex probe closed tube formats. The probes were tested in two commercially available thermocycling fluorimeters (the Light Cycler and the ABI Prism 7700). Comparison of the results obtained from the analysis of 43 samples showed no discrepancies between our 5' nuclease assay and the restriction length polymorphism analysis, which is routinely used in hospitals. The reported real time PCR technology is ideal for the clinical setting as it is sensitive, eliminates the labor and supply costs of post-PCR steps, reduces the risk of crossover contamination, minimizes sources of error, and can be fully automated.	11465544
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Solid-phase amplification for detection of C282y and H63D hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations.	Clinical chemistry	2001	7.46	There is a need for simple, rapid, and inexpensive methods for the detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Our aim was to develop a single-tube ELISA-like PCR assay and evaluate it by detecting the common C282Y and H63D mutations found in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) by use of clinical samples. The method, termed solid-phase amplification (SPA), involves dual liquid- and solid-phase amplification of a target sequence by the use of two PCR primers, one of which is in two forms: the first is covalently immobilized to the wall of a microwell, and the second is free in solution. During allele-specific amplification, both the free and solid-phase amplicons are labeled by incorporation of digoxigenin (DIG)-dUTP. The amount of surface-bound amplicon is determined colorimetrically by the use of an alkaline phosphatase-anti-DIG-Fab conjugate and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Two different amplicon-labeling methods were evaluated. Analysis of 173 clinical samples for the C282Y and H63D HFE point mutations with SPA revealed that only one sample was incorrectly diagnosed, apparently because of operator error, when compared with conventional restriction fragment length polymorphism assay results. The SPA assay has potential for medium-scale mutation detection, having the advantage of being manipulatively simple and immediately adaptable for use in clinical laboratories with existing ELISA instrumentation.	11468226
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	C282Y and H63D mutations of HFE gene in patients with advanced alcoholic liver disease.	Revista espanola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espanola de Patologia Digestiva	2001	1.46	To test the hypothesis that the heterozygous state for HFE gene mutations involved in the pathogenesis of hemochromatosis, that may induce an increase of hepatic iron content, may aggravate the liver damage induced by prolonged and excessive use of ethanol. C282Y and H63D mutations of HFE gene were identified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on leukocyte DNA, in 125 consecutive patients diagnosed of advanced alcoholic liver disease (109 men, mean age 54 years, SD 11) and 181 healthy controls. All subjects were white Spaniards. RESULTS (CASES/CONTROLS): 1. Genotype distribution: a) mutation C282Y: no homozygotes, 10/23 heterozygotes, 115/158 normal (p = 0.60); b) mutation H63D: 9/5 homozygotes, 46/52 heterozygotes, 70/124 normal (Chi square 6.51, p = 0.039). 2. Allele frequencies: a) mutation C282Y: 240/339 normal, 10/23 mutated (p = 0.21); b) mutation H63D: 186/300 normal, 64/62 mutated (odds ratio 1.66, 95% CI 1.10-2.52, p = 0.01). Our results suggest that H63D mutation of the HFE gene, but not the C282Y mutation, is associated to the risk of developing advanced liver alcoholic disease.	11469076
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Overexpression of HFE in HepG2 cells reveals differences in intracellular distribution and co-localization of wt- and mutated forms.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Liver is the primary target organ of Hereditary Hemochromatosis Type I, with the HFE mutations C282Y and H63D recognized as markers of this iron-overload disease. Hepatocytes are also the main site of synthesis of HFE. However, most early studies of overexpression of HFE were done in non-hepatic, non-HFE-expressing, cell lines. Here we report the setting up of a stable transfection model of wt- and mutant-HFE (H63D and C282Y) proteins in a hepatic cell line (HepG2), the analysis of its intracellular distribution and the effect of diferric transferrin on HFE localization. The C282Y mutant is retained in the ER, whereas HFE-wt and H63D co-localize with TfR1 exclusively in early recycling endosomes. Holotransferrin induces a re-localization of wt- and H63D-HFE, from early recycling endosomes to the cytoplasmic membrane. In conclusion our results establish the HepG2 cell line as a valuable model for the study of HFE.	17428702
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Definition of C282Y mutation in a hereditary hemochromatosis family from Turkey.	The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology	2007	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with the mutation of the HFE gene. C282Y and H63D mutations in this gene have been described. Hereditary hemochromatosis is primarily associated with the C282Y mutation; the importance of H63D is not well known. In previously reported studies, the C282Y mutation was not detected in Turkey. We herein present a family in which the C282Y mutation was detected. A consanguineous marriage produced 10 children. A 33-year-old man (index case) was diagnosed with hemochromatosis (transferrin saturation rate 80%, ferritin 514 ng/ml, liver biopsy showed +3 iron accumulation, liver involvement in MRI), and genetic analysis showed homozygous C282Y mutation. With family screening, another brother was also diagnosed with hemochromatosis. Transferrin saturation rate was high (>45%) in seven healthy brothers and the father. Genetic analysis revealed two cases with C282Y homozygous mutations, three with C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous mutations, one C282Y heterozygous and three H63D heterozygous among the family members. This is the first family in Turkey in which the C282Y mutation has been detected.	17450498
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Contribution of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and rheumatoid factor to the diagnosis of arthropathy in haemochromatosis.	Annals of the rheumatic diseases	2007	12.38	To investigate the prevalence of antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) and rheumatoid factor in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HHC) and to evaluate their diagnostic reliability in distinguishing HHC-associated arthropathy from rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-CCP antibodies and rheumatoid factor levels were determined by ELISA in sera from 87 patients with HHC homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, 31 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 162 healthy controls. Of the 87 patients with HHC, 32 (36.8%) had joint involvement. Anti-CCP antibodies were detected in only 1 patient (1.1%) with HHC, who had no joint disease, and in (1.2%) healthy controls. In total, 18 (58.1%) patients with rheumatoid arthritis displayed anti-CCP reactivity (p<0.001). Rheumatoid factor was detected in 10 (11.5%) patients with HHC compared with 7 (4.3%) healthy control subjects (p = 0.03) and 21 of 31 (65.6%) patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Testing for anti-CCP antibodies discriminates HHC arthropathy from rheumatoid arthritis, as these patients were consistently anti-CCP negative. Thus, HHC arthropathy should be considered in the differential diagnosis of CCP-negative arthritis.	17456529
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Accuracy of family history of hemochromatosis or iron overload: the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening study.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2008	7.68	The aim of this study was to assess the analytic validity of self-reported family history of hemochromatosis or iron overload. A total of 141 probands, 549 family members, and 641 controls participated in the primary care Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study. Participants received a postscreening clinical examination and completed questionnaires about personal and family histories of hemochromatosis or iron overload, arthritis, diabetes, liver disease, and heart disease. We evaluated sensitivities and specificities of proband-reported family history, and concordance of HFE genotype C282Y/C282Y in probands and siblings who reported having hemochromatosis or iron overload. The sensitivities of proband-reported family history ranged from 81.4% for hemochromatosis or iron overload to 18.4% for liver disease; specificities for diabetes, liver disease, and heart disease were greater than 94%. Hemochromatosis or iron overload was associated with a positive family history across all racial/ethnic groups in the study (odds ratio, 14.53; 95% confidence intervals, 7.41-28.49; P < .0001) and among Caucasians (odds ratio, 16.98; 95% confidence intervals, 7.53-38.32; P < .0001). There was 100% concordance of HFE genotype C282Y/C282Y in 6 probands and 8 of their siblings who reported having hemochromatosis or iron overload. Self-reported family history of hemochromatosis or iron overload can be used to identify individuals whose risk of hemochromatosis or iron overload and associated conditions is increased. These individuals could benefit from further evaluation with iron phenotyping and HFE mutation analysis.	18585964
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE C282Y homozygotes have reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study.	Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine	2008	4.56	Recent studies have raised questions about the long-term health risks for individuals with mutations in the HFE gene, although previous studies may have been plagued by selection bias or lack of population-based comparison groups. We examined cardiovascular disease risk factors and iron and liver biomarkers, as well as morbidity and mortality associated with the C282Y and H63D variants of HFE in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, which is a population-based cohort of nearly 16,000 U.S. white and black men and women who were 45-64 years old at baseline. Subjects were followed for an average of 15 years for death, incident coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure, and an average of 8 years for incident diabetes. The prevalence of C282Y homozygosity was 0.42% (45/10,800) in whites, which is similar to other North American population-based studies. C282Y homozygotes had significantly lower mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and fibrinogen as well as higher mean levels of iron (ferritin, transferrin saturation) and liver biomarkers (alanine aminotransferase, Hepascore) compared with HFE wild-type subjects. Rates of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes were similar across HFE genotypes. These prospective, population-based data indicate higher serum iron indices and possible mild liver dysfunction or disease in some C282Y homozygotes, but they provide little evidence that HFE C282Y or H63D mutations are related to all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. Reduced LDL in C282Y homozygotes may be because of effects of excess iron on cholesterol metabolism and lipoprotein formation in the liver.	18593631
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Cell surface expression of HFE protein in epithelial cells, macrophages, and monocytes.	Haematologica	2000	6.67	Most patients with hereditary hemochromatosis are homozygous for a Cys282AETyr mutation in the HFE gene. This mutation has been shown to impair the association of the HFE gene product with b(2)-microglobulin and to prevent its cell surface presentation in transfected COS-7 and 293 cells. This study was performed to examine the expression of HFE protein in epithelial cells, macrophages, and circulating leukocytes obtained from normal subjects and patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. Antisera against two different peptides of the HFE protein were used to immunostain tissue sections and isolate granulocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes. Immunocytochemical staining showed that the HFE protein is expressed in gastric epithelial cells, tissue macrophages, and circulating monocytes and granulocytes. The cell surface associated signal, which was seen in normal gastric epithelial cells, monocytes and macrophages, was also present in C282Y mutant cells from patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, although at apparently reduced amounts in these cells. From these studies, it is clear that the C282Y mutation reduces but does not completely prevent presentation of the HFE protein on the cell surface of human monocytes, tissue macrophages, and gastric epithelial cells.	10756356
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Immunohistochemistry of HFE in the duodenum of C282Y homozygotes with antisera for recombinant HFE protein.	Haematologica	2000	6.67	HFE is a class-I MHC related protein which carries the C282Y mutation in most patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron overload disease. HFE protein is expected to have a relevant role in the regulation of duodenal iron absorption, and HFE protein was immunohistochemically identified in the crypt cells. The aim of the work was to analyze whether the C282Y mutation affects HFE accumulation in the duodenum. We developed antisera for the extracellular portion of recombinant human HFE protein expressed in E. coli. The antisera were specific for HFE protein and the C282Y mutant in immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry experiments of transfected cells, and they did not cross react with HLA antigens in various analyses. The antisera gave positive results in the staining of paraffin-fixed sections of duodenal slices of subjects with hemochromatosis. The antisera stained evident supranuclear granules in all enterocytes of 7 C282Y homozygous subjects, and a dark area in the same region in 3 other C282Y homozygotes. Granular bodies were absent from the duodenal sections of 8 C282Y negative subjects, from 2 C282Y heterozygotes and 3 C282Y homozygotes, with or without hemochromatosis. The detection of HFE-protein in granular bodies in the enterocytes of the large majority (77%) of C282Y homozygotes and not in other subjects suggests that the mutation facilitates protein accumulation in the duodenum.	10756357
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for genetic haemochromatosis in blood samples with raised alanine aminotransferase.	Gut	2000	14.92	In the UK approximately 1 in 140 people are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene and are at risk from iron overload caused by genetic haemochromatosis (GH). Early detection can prevent organ damage secondary to iron deposition and increase life expectancy. To screen for GH in all blood samples sent to the laboratory for routine liver function tests in which raised serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was detected. ALT was measured in sera sent to the laboratory for routine liver function tests. In those samples found to have raised activity, transferrin saturation and ferritin were measured followed by genetic testing when transferrin saturation was increased. Of the 35 069 serum samples assayed for routine liver function tests, 1490 (4.2%) had raised ALT levels (>50 u/l). Transferrin saturation and serum ferritin concentrations were measured in these patient samples, and in 56 transferrin saturation was >60%. Further blood samples were requested from these patients for genetic testing: 33 samples were obtained. There were nine patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene and three compound heterozygotes (heterozygous for both C282Y and H63D mutations). The association of raised ALT activity and transferrin saturation of >60% could provide a simple, cost effective method for detecting individuals with clinical haemochromatosis. Although many patients with GH may have been missed, this study suggests that the clinical penetrance of the disorder may be much lower than is generally supposed and that genetic screening will identify many people who may never develop clinical haemochromatosis.	10764716
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical and molecular aspects of juvenile hemochromatosis in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean (Quebec, canada).	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2000	0.5	We report the clinical, biochemical, and genetic characteristics of 13 hemochromatosis patients from Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean in whom the first symptoms appeared before age 30. Although the mean age at onset of the first symptoms was 21. 5 years, their mean age at diagnosis was 23.8 years; the diagnosis was particularly delayed among women. Seventy-seven percent of the patients had hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and 69% heart failure and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Genetic analysis of the HFE gene revealed heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation in 2 patients and for the S65C mutation in 2 others and homozygosity for the H63D mutation in 1 patient. The remaining 8 patients had no identified mutation in the HFE gene, although sequencing of all seven codons and intron-exon junctions was performed (5 patients). All 13 patients fulfill the clinical criteria of juvenile hemochromatosis and represent the largest cluster thus far reported.	10772871
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Molecular genetic studies of multiple sclerosis in the portuguese population.	Acta medica portuguesa		0.3	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neuroinflammatory autoimmune disease believed to arise from complex interactions of both environmental and genetic factors. As in other complex diseases with autoimmune features, a genetic association with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex is well documented. Association and genome-wide studies were performed in Portuguese patients with MS over several years. Genes such as HLA-DRB1, HLA-A, HFE, TNFA, CTLA-4, PTPN22 and ApoE were investigated. ApoE, PTPN22 1858T, CTLA-4 -318C, TNFA-308A, HFE C282Y and TLR9 T-1237C polymorphisms were not shown to be associated with the development of MS. The HLA-DRB1*15 allele was confirmed as the major genetic marker for susceptibility to MS. The presence of HLA-A*02 and TNFA -238A alleles decreased the risk of developing MS. Patients carrying the HFE C282Y variant seem to have a worse prognosis. The HLA-DRB1*15 and PTPN22 1858T variants were associated with a better outcome in this population.	23079250
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Why do people choose not to have screening for hemochromatosis?	Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers	2013	1.3	Hemochromatosis is a common disorder of iron overload most commonly due to homozogosity for the HFE C282Y substitution. A workplace-screening program was conducted in which over 11,000 individuals were screened for this mutation. A substudy of this project was to ascertain why people chose not to attend information and screening sessions offered in their workplace. Staff were recruited by email, questionnaires in common areas, and direct approach. A purpose-designed questionnaire sought the reasons for not attending information and screening sessions. The nonattender questionnaire was distributed at 24 workplaces and completed by 872 individuals. The most common reason for not attending sessions, accounting for 70.1%, was practical (e.g., unaware of session, too busy, or unavailable). Other relatively common reasons were that the individual had low iron levels or were a blood donor (14.9%), or that hemochromatosis was considered unimportant (12.2%). Insurance concerns were very rarely cited as the reason for nonattendance (1.0%). The nonattender data presented here indicate that concerns about insurance, anxiety, and use of genetic information are not major factors for why people did not attend workplace information and screening sessions for hereditary hemochromatosis. Practical barriers were the major reasons identified. This highlights that when implementing screening programs, as many practical barriers as possible need to be overcome, so that a maximum number of people who would like to be informed about screening are given the opportunity to do so.	23098241
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[The importance of DNA analysis of C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in the HFE gene].	Casopis lekaru ceskych	2012	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a relatively common genetic disease characterized by increased iron absorption and deposition in major organs of the body. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in the HFE gene in patients suspected of hereditary hemochromatosis and to compare it with healthy subjects (control group). The group of patients consisted of 95 males and 45 females (median age 55 years, range 20 to 83 years). The control group was represented by 167 volunteers of Caucasian origin (65 males and 102 females, median age 25 years, range 18 to 62 years). The PCR/RFLP genetic analysis was used to detect mutations in the HFE gene. Allelic frequencies of C282Y, H63D, and S65C in the groups of patients were 18.2 %, 17.5 %, and 1.8 %, respectively. The frequencies of the alleles in the control group were 5.7 % (C282Y), 12.3 % (H63D), and 0.6 % (S65C). Our results show significant differences in the frequency of C282Y mutation between the patients suspected of hereditary hemochromatosis and the control group (18.2 % vs. 5.7 %). The prevalence of H63D and S65C mutations in both groups was not statistically significant.	23102134
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Lack of association of primary iron overload and common HFE gene mutations with liver cirrhosis in adult Indian population.	Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology	2011	0.5	To find out the association of common HFE mutations (viz., C282Y and H63D) with primary iron overload (PIL) in liver cirrhosis (CLD) patients of Indian origin. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used for screening C282Y and H63D mutation in 496 CLD patients (hepatitis B virus associated cirrhosis (HBVc) = 74, hepatitis C virus associated cirrhosis (HCV) = 50, alcoholic cirrhosis with hepatitis (ALcW)  =  38, alcoholic cirrhosis without hepatitis (ALc) = 92, cryptogenic cirrhosis (CC) = 242) and 502 healthy controls. Transferrin saturation of >45 or serum ferritin of >300 ng/mL (males)/>200 ng/mL (females) with normal total exogenous iron intake was suggestive of PIL. Histological liver iron grading was done by Perl's Prussian blue stain. Of 496 patients, 13 (2.6; 9 CC, 2 ALc, 1 HBVc, 1 AlcW) had PIL. However, only two (15.3) of 13 patients (1 CC and 1 HBVc) were positive for H63D heterozygous mutation. All the subjects were found to be C282Y wild type, except a single case of double heterozygous (C282Y/H63D) who however, did not have PIL. Overall frequency of H63D allele in patients and controls was not significantly different (5.95 and 4.58 respectively, p = 0.17). A highly significant H63D allele frequency (p  <  0.005) was observed in HBVc (10.82) and ALcW (11.84) groups but they were not associated with PIL. The frequency of PIL, and the HFE gene mutaion (C282Y) are both rare in Indian patients and explain why hemochromatosis is a rare cause of liver cirrhosis in India. A highly significant H63D allele frequency in HBV and alcohol-related cirrhosis suggest a possible predisposing role for liver fibrosis of this allele.	21822737
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hepcidin and HFE protein: Iron metabolism as a target for the anemia of chronic kidney disease.	World journal of nephrology	2012	0.5	The anemia of chronic kidney disease and hemodialysis is characterized by chronic inflammation and release of cytokines, resulting in the upregulation of the iron hormone hepcidin, also increased by iron therapy and reduced glomerular filtration, with consequent reduction in iron absorption, recycling, and availability to the erythron. This response proves advantageous in the short-term to restrain iron availability to pathogens, but ultimately leads to severe anemia, and impairs the response to erythropoietin (Epo) and iron. Homozygosity for the common C282Y and H63D HFE polymorphisms influence iron metabolism by hampering hepcidin release by hepatocytes in response to increased iron stores, thereby resulting in inadequate inhibition of the activity of Ferroportin-1, inappropriately high iron absorption and recycling, and iron overload. However, in hemodialysis patients, carriage of HFE mutations may confer an adaptive benefit by decreasing hepcidin release in response to iron infusion and inflammation, thereby improving iron availability to erythropoiesis, anemia control, the response to Epo, and possibly survival. Therefore, anti-hepcidin therapies may improve anemia management in hemodialysis. However, HFE mutations directly favor hemoglobinization independently of hepcidin, and reduce macrophages activation in response to inflammation, whereas hepcidin might also play a beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-microbic action during sepsis, so that direct inhibition of HFE-mediated regulation of iron metabolism may represent a valuable alternative therapeutic target. Genetic studies may offer a valuable tool to test these hypotheses and guide the research of new therapies.	24175256
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Spectrum of mutations in the HFE gene implicated in haemochromatosis and porphyria.	Human molecular genetics	1999	5.99	Mutation analysis was performed on DNA samples of 965 individuals from four different ethnic groups in South Africa, in an attempt to determine the spectrum of sequence variants in the haemochromatosis ( HFE ) gene. This population screening approach, utilizing a combined heteroduplex and single-strand conformation polymorphism (HEX-SSCP) method, revealed three previously described and four novel missense mutations. Novel variants V53M and V59M were identified in exon 2, Q127H in exon 3 and R330M in exon 5. The exon 5 variant was identified in one of 13 patients referred for a molecular diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH), who tested negative for the known C282Y and H63D mutations. Mutation Q127H was detected in exon 3 of the HFE gene together with mutation H63D in an apparently severely affected patient previously shown to carry the protoporphyrinogen oxidase ( PPOX ) gene mutation R59W, which accounts for dominantly inherited variegate porphyria (VP) in >80% of affected South Africans. The mutant allele frequency of the C282Y mutation was found to be significantly lower in 73 apparently unrelated VP patients with the R59W mutation than in 102 controls drawn from the same population ( P = 0.005). The population screening approach used in this study revealed considerable genotypic variation in the HFE gene and supports previous data on the involvement of this gene in the porphyria phenotype.	10401000
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Population-based screening for hemochromatosis using phenotypic and DNA testing among employees of health maintenance organizations in Springfield, Missouri.	The American journal of medicine	1999	0.5	Hemochromatosis reportedly affects 3 to 8 persons per 1,000 and is associated with an elevated risk of morbidity and mortality. We sought to ascertain its prevalence in a community and to assess the association between phenotype and genotype. All health maintenance organization employees were invited to participate in hemochromatosis screening using a repeated elevation of the transferrin saturation test as the case definition (> or = 50% in women and > or = 60% in men with no other cause). Iron overload from hemochromatosis was defined as serum ferritin concentration > or = 95th percentile and mobilizable iron > or = 99th percentile for age and sex, or hepatic iron index > or = 1.9. The HFE gene was analyzed for mutations. Participation among employees was 28% (1,653 of 6,000); 83% were women. The prevalence of hemochromatosis was 8 per 1,000 (13 of 1,653), and the prevalence of iron overload from hemochromatosis was 4 per 1,000 (5 of 1,653). Compared with those who had no HFE mutation, the relative risk (RR) for hemochromatosis was greatest for C282Y homozygotes (RR = 147), compound heterozygotes (RR = 19), and H63D homozygotes (RR = 9). Overall, 38% of participants had at least one HFE mutation. Screening based on an initial elevated transferrin saturation test had the best sensitivity, whereas DNA testing offered the best specificity and predictive value positive for iron overload disease. In this population, we found a greater than expected prevalence of hemochromatosis and demonstrated a clear association with the HFE genotype. Promotion of screening is complicated by controversies in case definition and the large number of persons who will be detected before they have clinically significant iron loading, in whom the risk of clinical disease is unknown. Larger screening studies in more diverse populations are necessary to characterize the burden of disease and to follow those at risk (based on HFE or iron status measures) to establish the natural history of hemochromatosis.	10403350
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Spur cell anaemia and hepatic iron stores in patients with alcoholic liver disease undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation.	Gut	1999	14.92	Following orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) histological examination of explant livers from patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) sometimes shows extensive iron deposits in a distribution suggestive of homozygous haemochromatosis. To use haemochromatosis gene (HFE) assays to distinguish between ALD with notable siderosis and hereditary haemochromatosis. To evaluate the possible influence of spur cell haemolytic anaemia on hepatic iron loading. Thirty seven patients with ALD were abstinent for at least six months prior to OLT. Twenty three patients had transferrin saturations greater than 55%, 16 also had increased serum ferritin (>350 micrograms/l). Eight of 37 (22%) explant livers had grade 3 or 4 hepatic iron deposition, predominantly in hepatocytes. Of these, four had a hepatic iron index greater than 1. 9 and most seemed to have spur cell haemolytic anaemia. Mutation analysis for C282Y and H63D mutations was performed on DNA extracts from peripheral blood or explant liver. Spur cell haemolytic anaemia was diagnosed when the haemoglobin was 105 g/l in the presence of notable acanthocytosis. None of the eight patients with grade 3 or 4 hepatic iron had evidence of the C282Y mutation. Two of the eight were heterozygous for H63D. None of the remaining 28 patients tested showed homozygous HFE mutations. Spur cell anaemia was present in six of the eight patients with heavy iron deposition and only one of the remaining patients. The HFE mutation was not present in these patients with advanced ALD and heavy iron loading. Spur cell haemolytic anaemia provides an alternative potential mechanism for the heavy iron loading.	10403746
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association of the apolipoprotein E 2 allele with concurrent occurrence of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma.	Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity	2015	4.49	Genes encoding proteins with antioxidant properties may influence susceptibility to endometrial hyperplasia (EH) and endometrial carcinoma (ECa). Patients with EH (n = 89), EH concurrent with ECa (n = 76), ECa (n = 186), and healthy controls (n = 1110) were genotyped for five polymorphic variants in the genes involved in metabolism of lipoproteins (APOE Cys112Arg and Arg158Cys), iron (HFE Cys282Tyr and His63Asp), and catecholamines (COMT Val158Met). Patients and controls were matched by ethnicity (all Caucasians), age, body mass index (BMI), and incidence of hypertension and diabetes. The frequency of the APOE E 2 allele (158Cys) was higher in patients with EH + ECa than in controls (P = 0.0012, P(Bonferroni) = 0.018, OR = 2.58, 95% CI 1.49-4.45). The APOE E 4 allele (112Arg) was more frequently found in patients with EH than in controls and HFE minor allele G (63Asp) had a protective effect in the ECa group, though these results appeared to be nonsignificant after correction for multiple comparisons. The results of the study indicate that E 2 allele might be associated with concurrent occurrence of EH and ECa.	25741405
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene mutations: prevalence and effects on pegylated-interferon and ribavirin therapy response in chronic hepatitis C in sardinia.	Journal of clinical and experimental hepatology	2012	0.5	Considerable evidence suggests that iron could be a comorbid factor for liver injury in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Elevated iron indices are frequently described in CHC and may impact negatively on the course of liver disease and on the response to interferon alfa therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of hemochromatosis gene mutations in Sardinian CHC patients, the association with iron overload and the impact on response to therapy. Sixty-nine CHC patients were enrolled. Iron indices, hepatic and viral parameters were detected. C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations were identified through a PCR. Liver biopsy was performed for hepatic fibrosis evaluation. All patients were treated for 6 months (viral genotype 2/3) or 12 months (viral genotype 1/4) with pegylated-interferon 180 mcg once weekly and ribavirin 1000-1200 mg/daily. Sustained virological response (SVR) was defined as undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after the end of treatment. HFE gene mutation was detected in 29 patients (42%). The presence of HFE mutations was significantly associated with elevated transferrin saturation (P < 0.01). Hepatic fibrosis was more advanced in HFE mutation carriers (χ (2), P = 0.04). Among mutation carriers 27.5% achieved responses at the end of treatment compared with 60% of non-carriers (P = 0.005). Patients with HFE wildtype produced significant SVR compared with patients with HFE mutations (P = 0.03). The literature shows discordant results about the prevalence, hepatic distribution and possible therapeutic implications of iron overload in chronic hepatitis C. Our findings shows that HFE gene mutations could favor, synergically with CHC and other genetic or acquired factors, the development of liver damage and could influence the outcome of interferon treatment with higher rate of non-response.	25755436
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Unusual retinopathy associated with hemochromatosis.	Retinal cases & brief reports	2015	0.5	To describe unusual retinal findings of a patient affected by hemochromatosis. Case report of a 49-year-old patient who presented a progressive loss of vision. Fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, full-field electroretinogram, autofluorescence imaging, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography were performed. The patient was known to be homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. Visual acuity was measured at 20/20 on his right eye and 20/25 on his left eye. Retinal imaging showed alterations of the retinal pigment epithelium clearly visible on fundus autofluorescence and fluorescein angiography. The spectral domain optical coherence tomography showed retinal pigmentary epithelial atrophy associated with irregularities and focal interruption of the ellipsoid zone. A thin retina was also observed in the foveolar region associated to a thickened choroid. Full-field electroretinogram showed a decrease of rods and cones responses. Here, the authors describe the retinal findings of a patient affected by hemochromatosis, characterized by unusual retinal pigment epithelium changes associated to altered visual function. The authors hypothesize that the retinopathy could be linked to hemochromatosis because of the pathophysiology of iron homeostasis and the toxicity of iron overload for the photoreceptors.	25767899
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The risk of new-onset cancer associated with HFE C282Y and H63D mutations: evidence from 87,028 participants.	Journal of cellular and molecular medicine	2016	4.94	To investigate the association between mutation of HFE (the principal pathogenic gene in hereditary haemochromatosis) and risk of cancer, we conducted a meta-analysis of all available case-control or cohort studies relating to two missense mutations, C282Y and H63D mutations. Eligible studies were identified by searching databases including PubMed, Embase and the ISI Web of Knowledge. Overall and subgroup analyses were performed and odds ratios (ORs) combined with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied to evaluate the association between C282Y mutation, H63D mutation and cancer risk. Sensitivity and cumulative analyses were used to evaluate the stability of the results. A total of 36 eligible studies were included, comprising 13,680 cases and 73,348 controls. C282Y was significantly associated with elevated cancer risk in a recessive genetic model (OR: 1.991, 95% CI: 1.448-2.737). On subgroup analysis stratified by cancer type, statistically significantly increased cancer risks were found for breast cancer, colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma in a recessive model. When stratified by territory, a significantly increased risk of cancer was found in Oceanic populations in a recessive model and in Asian populations in an allele model and dominant model. H63D mutation did not significantly increase overall cancer risk in any genetic model. However, when, stratified by territory, an increased cancer risk was found in the Asian population in an allele and dominant. C282Y but not H63D mutation was related to elevated cancer risk. Further large-scale studies considering gene-environment interactions and functional research should be conducted to further investigate this association.	26893171
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron supplementation in athletes--first do no harm.	Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)		0.5	Although it generally does not improve performance, iron is often used by elite athletes. The physiologic changes induced by exercise can mimic iron deficiency and decrease hemoglobin and ferritin concentrations. Determination of serum transferrin receptor concentrations may identify true iron deficiency, which occurs particularly in young athletes. In contrast, increased iron stores in the body are a frequent finding in elite athletes who have used long-term iron supplementation. Elite runners have increased intestinal blood loss, but this usually can be compensated by enhanced absorption of dietary iron. The combination of exercise-induced hemolysis with enhanced intestinal blood loss in various endurance sports leads to severe abnormalities of routine tests, and extreme physical activity may be responsible for positive fecal occult blood determinations. Indiscriminate iron supplementation carries the risk of inducing hemochromatosis in individuals homozygous for the widespread C282Y allele of the HFE gene. This polymorphism is common and can be found in about 1% of individuals of Northern European descent; moreover, iron supplementation can modify the presentation of important underlying diseases such as celiac disease or colon carcinoma. In conclusion, iron supplements should be prescribed for athletes with iron-deficiency anemia and carefully monitored if given for prophylaxis; unless a therapeutic response occurs, investigations to establish the cause of iron deficiency should be initiated.	15212743
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis-causing mutations C282Y and H63D are not risk factors for coronary artery disease in Caucasians with type 2 diabetes.	Folia biologica	2004	0.83	Iron metabolism might be involved in the pathogenesis of CAD, and C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene are associated with increased serum iron levels and net iron accumulation. The aim of this study was to look for a relationship between the C282Y and H63D gene mutations of the HFE gene and coronary artery disease (CAD) in a group of patients with type 2 diabetes lasting more than 10 years. The C282Y and H63D gene mutations were tested in 338 Caucasians with type 2 diabetes: 156 cases with CAD and 182 subjects with no history of CAD. The C282Y and the H63D HFE gene distributions in patients with CAD (C282Y: YY 0.6%, CY 9.0%, CC 90.4%; H63D: DD 3.8%, HD 21.8%, HH 74.4%) were not significantly different from those of diabetic subjects without CAD (C282Y: YY 0%, CY 8.2%, CC 91.8%; H63D: DD 2.2%, HD 20.3%, HH 77.5%). In conclusion, we failed to demonstrate that the C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations were risk factors for CAD in Caucasians with type 2 diabetes lasting longer than 10 years.	15222129
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	DMT1 genetic variability is not responsible for phenotype variability in hereditary hemochromatosis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Homozygosity for a cysteine to tyrosine translocation at position 282 within the HFE gene (C282Y) is responsible for over 90% of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) in Celtic populations. Determining those C282Y homozygotes at greatest risk for iron overload is a major clinical concern as only a small percentage will develop clinically significant iron overload. Divalent metal transport protein (DMT1) on the apical surface of duodenal enterocytes is recognised as the major iron import protein. We investigated whether genetic variability within the DMT1 gene may partly explain the phenotypic variability seen amongst a group of C282Y homozygotes with iron overload. One hundred and one unrelated C282Y homozygotes and 103 C282Y negative controls were analysed for the presence of four specific mutations/polymorphisms within the DMT1 gene (1245T/C, 1303C/A, IVS4 + 44C/A, IVS15Ex16-16C/G) using standard PCR techniques. Hepatic iron deposition was determined in 32 HH patients following Perls Prussian blue staining (0-4+). Estimations of the haplotype frequencies were performed utilising the program Arlequin version 2. There were no significant differences in the allele frequencies of the IVS4 + 44C/A, 1303C/A, 1254T/C and IVS15Ex16-16C/G polymorphisms in the patient cohort compared to those observed in the control cohort. The commonest haplotypes identified were CCTC: IVS4C + 44C, 1303C, 1254T, IVS15ex16-16C; ACCC: IVS4C + 44A, 1303C, 1254C, IVS15ex16-16C and ACTG: IVS4C + 44A, 1303C, 1254T, IVS15ex16-16G. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of these three haplotypes in the patient cohorts (regardless of the degree of hepatic iron deposition) compared to the control cohort. Polymorphisms within DMT1 gene do not influence penetrance of the HH phenotype.	15223008
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis (HFE) and transferrin receptor-1 (TFRC1) genes in sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda (sPCT).	Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)	2002	0.5	Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a disorder characterized by a photosensitive dermatosis and hepatic siderosis, is caused by a decreased activity of the hepatic enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD). Two forms of PCT have been described: a familial one (fPCT) with an inherited decrease of UROD activity in all tissues and a sporadic one (sPCT) with a decreased UROD activity restricted to the liver. Iron overload and acquired factors including hepatic viral infections, alcohol, drugs contribute to the expression of PCT. In 65 French sPCT patients and 108 controls we have evaluated the respective role of iron and HCV status, the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations frequencies (H63D. S65C, C282Y), and in a case control study we searched for an association between sPCT and the human transferrin receptor-1 (TFRC1) gene whose product is thought to be in functional association with the HFE protein: three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously characterized and 2 novel ones were studied. The iron-related parameters and transaminases were higher in sPCT patients than those of non-porphyric controls. Of the sPCT patients studied, 28% were HCV positive. In the HFE gene, 17% of sPCT patients carried C282Y mutation compared to 4% in controls, no significant differences were found with H63D and S65C variants. Compound heterozygous genotypes, C282Y/H63D or C282Y/S65C, were not significantly different in sPCT and control groups. Independently from HFE gene mutations, an association was found between the IVS4+198 T allele in the TFRC1 gene and sPCT patients. Analysis of HFE genotypes indicated that C282Y (but not H63D nor S65C) is a susceptibility factor for the development of sPCT in West European continental patients. However, analysis of TFRC1 genotypes suggest that sPCT should be considered as a multifactorial disorder in which other intracellular iron metabolism genes could be involved.	11929045
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical expression and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients with heterozygous mutations for haemochromatosis.	Diabetes & metabolism	2002	4.69	Elevated iron metabolism indices as well as liver enzymes abnormalities have been reported in type 2 diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and biological characteristics of overweight or obese type 2 diabetic subjects, with and without heterozygosity for HFE gene mutation (C282Y or H63D). We also assessed their insulin sensitivity and B cell function. 90 patients (age and diabetes duration: 61 +/- 11 and 12 +/- 8 years [mean +/- 1 SD]) were included. BMI was 32 +/- 6 kg/m(2). HbA(1c) was 8.9 +/- 1.8%. HFE genotyping was performed by PCR and restriction enzyme cleavage. Insulin sensitivity and B cell function were measured by the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA). Heterozygosity for C282Y (wt/C282Y) or H63D (wt/H63D) allele was found in 11 and 12 subjects respectively. There were no major differences in clinical status and iron parameters according to the single allelic presence of C282Y or H63D. However, systolic blood pressure [BP] was lower when such mutation was present. Insulin sensitivity and B cell function (HOMA) were comparable. When the cohort was divided according to gender, we found higher serum iron in females with than in those without HFE mutation (91 +/- 27 vs 73 +/- 25 microgram/dl;P=0.049), while a transferrin saturation index above 45% was observed in 36% of females with a mutation (vs 7% in wt/wt;P=0.06). When analysis was performed according to the presence of each particular mutation, we observed a transferrin saturation index higher than 45% in 60% of wt/C282Y patients vs 21% in the wt/wt group (P=0.008). A significantly lower BP was also identified in wt/C282Y patients. Cholesterol-HDL was 38 +/- 11 vs 46 +/- 12 mg/dl in wt/C282Y and wt/wt subjects, respectively (P=0.045). There were no differences in iron status, BP or lipids between wt/wt and wt/H63D subjects. Type 2 diabetic patients, in particular females, with mono-allelic C282Y mutation, had slightly increased iron parameters. Systolic BP and cholesterol-HDL were also lower in wt/C282Y subjects. No difference in insulin sensitivity or B cell function was observed in the presence of mono-allelic HFE mutations.	11938026
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genotyping of hemochromatosis-associated mutations in the HFE gene by PCR-RFLP and a novel reverse hybridization method.	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	2002	3.02	Comparative analysis of the hemochromatosis-associated mutations C282Y, H63D and S65C in the HFE gene in 51 patients using three different methods is reported. One PCR-RFLP method was based on general primers, whereas another employed mutation-specific mismatched primers. The third method was a new PCR-based reverse hybridisation line probe assay (LiPA), comprising DNA amplification by general primers followed by a single step reverse hybridization to specific probes, immobilized on a nitrocellulose strip. Forty-eight (94%) of the 51 samples yielded identical results by all three methods. Three discrepant results were obtained, caused by polymorphisms in the primer binding region, resulting in no amplification at all or selective amplification, leading to misinterpretation of the HFE genotype by PCR-RFLP. The design of the assay and the stringency of the reaction conditions used are crucial to obtain a correct HFE genotype. PCR-LiPA offers an easy and reliable alternative to currently used conventional methods.	11939483
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Regulation of transferrin-induced endocytosis by wild-type and C282Y-mutant HFE in transfected HeLa cells.	American journal of physiology. Cell physiology	2002	0.5	The hereditary hemochromatosis protein HFE is known to complex with the transferrin receptor; however, its function regarding endocytosis of transferrin is unclear. We performed patch-clamp capacitance measurements in transfected HeLa cells carrying wild-type or C282Y-mutant HFE cDNA under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive promoter. Whole cell experiments in cells with suppressed expression of wild-type HFE revealed a decrease in membrane capacitance, reflecting predominance of endocytosis in the presence of transferrin. Cells overexpressing C282Y-mutant HFE displayed less intense capacitance decreases, whereas no significant decrease was observed in cells overexpressing wild-type HFE. The formation of single endocytic vesicles in cells with suppressed expression of wild-type HFE was greatly increased in the presence of transferrin as revealed by cell-attached recordings. According to their calculated diameters, many of these vesicles corresponded to clathrin-coated vesicles. These results suggest that wild-type HFE negatively modulates the endocytic uptake of transferrin. This inhibitory effect is attenuated in cells expressing C282Y-mutant HFE. Time-resolved measurements of cell membrane capacitance provide a powerful tool to study transferrin-induced endocytosis in single cells.	11940510
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Relationship between HFE gene and hereditary hemochromatosis].	Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics	2002	0.5	HFE gene is a major histocompatibility complex class I-like gene, which was identified as a candidate gene for hemochromatosis in 1996. The proposed role for HFE is its part in the regulation of the interaction of the transferrin receptor with transferrin. Hemochromatosis, the common autosomal recessive disease of iron overload, affects at least 1 in 300 Caucasians. The identification of the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene has led to population screening studies. Much of this work has also included the analysis of a second mutation, H63D, which appears to have a low penetrability. HFE protein was recently found to coprecipitate with the transferrin receptor and to affect the reaction between transferrin and the transferrin receptor. Functional data suggest that the mutation C282Y abolishes the association of the HFE protein with beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M), making the complex unable to reach the cell surface. Clearly, if the mutation protein is unable to reach the cell surface, this regulatory feature is missing. The role of a second mutation in the HFE gene, H63D, is less clear. Current data suggest that this mutation protein can associate with beta 2-microglobulin and does reach the cell surface and that the defect lies in a failure to modify the affinity of the transferrin receptor for transferrin. This does not explain the low degree of penetrability associated with this mutation.	11941597
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of the S65C mutation of HFE and iron overload in 309 subjects heterozygous for C282Y.	Journal of hepatology	2002	10.59	HFE-related haemochromatosis is a common disorder of iron metabolism. Most affected individuals are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of HFE. Some are compound heterozygotes for C282Y/H63D. A small proportion have neither of these genotypes. We have investigated the phenotype of compound heterozygotes for C282Y and another missense mutation S65C. Genotype for the S65C mutation was determined in 309 subjects heterozygous for C282Y and negative for H63D, referred because of increased serum iron indices or family screening. A control sample comprising 315 individuals was also studied. Twelve individuals were compound heterozygotes for C282Y and S65C. Seven, referred for family screening, had normal serum iron indices. Five subjects had elevated serum iron indices; three of these had elevated hepatic iron and have received treatment for iron overload. Transferrin saturation was significantly elevated in C282Y/S65C compound heterozygotes compared with simple C282Y heterozygotes. Some C282Y/S65C compound heterozygotes have elevated serum iron indices and iron overload. The penetrance of this genotype is low and other genetic and environmental factors may influence the expression of iron loading. Screening for S65C may be useful in individuals with iron overload who are not homozygous for C282Y or compound heterozygous for C282Y/H63D.	11943417
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron uptake from plasma transferrin by the duodenum is impaired in the Hfe knockout mouse.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	2002	9.42	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a disorder of iron metabolism in which enhanced iron absorption of dietary iron causes increased iron accumulation in the liver, heart, and pancreas. Most individuals with HH are homozygous for a C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. The function of HFE protein is unknown, but it is hypothesized that it acts in association with beta(2)-microglobulin and transferrin receptor 1 to regulate iron uptake from plasma transferrin by the duodenum, the proposed mechanism by which body iron levels are sensed. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by comparing clearance of transferrin-bound iron in Hfe knockout (KO) mice with that observed in C57BL/6 control mice. The mice were fed either an iron-deficient, control, or iron-loaded diet for 6 weeks to alter body iron status. The mice then were injected i.v. with (59)Fe-transferrin, and blood samples were taken over 2 h to determine the plasma (59)Fe turnover. After 2 h, the mice were killed and the amount of radioactivity in the duodenum, liver, and kidney was measured. In both Hfe KO and C57BL/6 mice, plasma iron turnover and iron uptake from plasma transferrin by the duodenum, liver, and kidney correlated positively with plasma iron concentration. However, duodenal iron uptake from plasma transferrin was decreased in the Hfe KO mice compared with the control mice. Despite this difference in duodenal uptake, the Hfe KO mice showed no decrease in iron uptake by the liver and kidney or alteration in the plasma iron turnover when compared with C57BL/6 mice. These data support the hypothesis that HFE regulates duodenal uptake of transferrin-bound iron from plasma, and that this mechanism of sensing body iron status, as reflected in plasma iron levels, is impaired in HH.	11943867
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE interacts with the BMP type I receptor ALK3 to regulate hepcidin expression.	Blood	2014	11.84	Mutations in HFE are the most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). HFE mutations result in reduced expression of hepcidin, a hepatic hormone, which negatively regulates iron absorption from the duodenum and iron release from macrophages. However, the mechanism by which HFE regulates hepcidin expression in hepatocytes is not well understood. It is known that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway plays a central role in controlling hepcidin expression in the liver. Here we show that HFE overexpression increased Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and hepcidin expression, whereas inhibition of BMP signaling abolished HFE-induced hepcidin expression in Hep3B cells. HFE was found to associate with ALK3, inhibiting ALK3 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and increasing ALK3 protein expression and accumulation on the cell surface. The 2 HFE mutants associated with HH, HFE C282Y and HFE H63D, regulated ALK3 protein ubiquitination and trafficking differently, but both failed to increase ALK3 cell-surface expression. Deletion of Hfe in mice resulted in a decrease in hepatic ALK3 protein expression. Our results provide evidence that HFE induces hepcidin expression via the BMP pathway: HFE interacts with ALK3 to stabilize ALK3 protein and increase ALK3 expression at the cell surface.	24904118
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Molecular genetic analysis and clinical aspects of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis].	Der Orthopade	2014	0.5	The purpose of the study was to perform a molecular genetic analysis and to document clinical aspects in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. The study included 33 outpatients (23 males average age 50.6 years and 10 females average age 60.6 years) with a disorder of iron metabolism (transferrin saturation > 75 %) as confirmation of hemochromatosis who were subjected to molecular genetic and clinical analyses. A homozygous mutation of the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene (C282YY) was detected in 63.6 %, a compound heterozygous mutation (C282Y/H63D) in 30.3% and no mutation of the HFE gene was detected in 6.1 %. The following organ manifestations could be objectified: arthralgia (78.8 %), liver disease (39.9 %), skin hyperpigmentation (30.3 %), osteoporosis (24.2 %), diabetes mellitus (24.2 %) and cardiomyopathy (12.1 %). Comparison between patients with heterozygous and homozygous hemochromatosis revealed the following differences: compound heterozygote patients presented less frequently with osteoarthritis of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints and hands (85.7 %/71.4 % homozygotes vs. 60 %/60 % heterozygotes). Osteoarthritis of the shoulder joints and osteoporosis as well as hypothyroidism were more frequent in compound heterozygote patients, whereas osteoarthritis of the knee and hip joints as well as liver disease were more common in homozygote patients. No differences between both groups were seen with respect to the clinical manifestations of cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus. Prevalent causes of death in hereditary hemochromatosis are heart failure, liver disease (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma) and portal hypertension. Therefore, an early diagnosis, adequate therapy and genetic screening of family members are of great importance. Medicinal treatment will only effectively prevent deleterious organ involvement and subsequent complications if initiated at an early stage. Furthermore, an overview of the current data is given.	24906241
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE, the MHC and hemochromatosis: paradigm for an extended function for MHC class I.	Tissue antigens	2003	2.05	HFE was discovered as the hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) gene. It is located on chromosome 6 (6p21.3), 4Mb telomeric to the HLA-A locus, and its product has a structure similar to MHC class I molecules. HFE encodes two frequent mutations: C282Y and H63D. One of these (C282Y) is present in a large proportion of Caucasian HH patients. HFE has a tissue distribution compatible with a role in iron absorption (intestine), recycling (macrophages) and transport to the fetus (placenta).	12753664
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Population screening for hemochromatosis: a study in 5370 Spanish blood donors.	Journal of hepatology	2003	10.59	Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with homozygosity for C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, elevated serum transferrin saturation and excess iron deposits throughout the body. We conducted a population-based study in Spain to asses the prevalence of the HFE mutations and their effect on iron parameters. We screened 5370 blood donors for the C282Y and H63D HFE mutations by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. Serum iron, serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were also measured. We have found eight (five men and three women) blood donors who are C282Y homozygotes (0.15%) and 74 C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes (1.38%). Four out of the eight C282Y homozygotes, all men, had high serum ferritin and transferrin saturation values. No woman was detected with both iron parameters increased. Only one of the 74 C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes showed elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation values (penetrance 1.35%). Serum ferritin and transferrin saturation were significantly higher in C282Y homozygous men as compared with the rest of the genotypes. The C282Y/C282Y genotype frequency in Spain is 1 in 1004. The C282Y/C282Y genotype is clearly associated with an increase in iron parameters. Biochemical expression of the disease was found in 80% of the C282Y/C282Y men.	12763366
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Linkage disequilibrium between S65C HFE mutation and HLA A29-B44 haplotype in Terceira Island, Azores.	Human immunology	2003	2.13	Our objective was to investigate the frequency of HFE gene mutations and to study linkage disequilibrium (LD) between HLA-Class I alleles and these mutations in the population of Terceira Island, Azores, Portugal. A total of 218 unrelated individuals were investigated. Three HFE mutations--C282Y, H63D, and S65C--were identified by restriction endonuclease digestion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified genomic DNA. HLA-Class I alleles were typed by PCR-single-strand polymorphism. Gene frequencies and LD were estimated using Arlequin V 1.1. Six genotypes were found in the population: WT/WT (58.3%), H63D/WT (31.2%), H63D/H63D (2.3%), H63D/C282Y (0.9%), S65C/WT (4.1%), and C282Y/WT (3.2%). No cases of C282Y or S65C homozygosity were identified. HLA haplotype A3-B7 was in LD with C282Y; HLA alleles A29, B44, and HLA haplotype A29-B44 were in LD with S65C mutation. HFE gene frequencies in this population are similar to those in other European populations; HFE S65C mutation was found in LD with the alleles A29, B44, and with A29-B44 HLA haplotype.	12770794
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in heterozygotes for the mutation responsible for hereditary hemochromatosis.	Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver	2003	2.72	Insulin resistance is a key feature of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, a disease characterized by progressive iron overload due, in most cases, to homozygosity for C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, have often decreased insulin sensitivity and release. To determine whether increased iron parameters/heterozygosity for the mutations of the HFE gene confer susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. One hundred and thirty-four consecutive Italian patients with clinical and ultrasonographic diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (82 with hyperferritinemia), half confirmed by liver biopsy. Insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay. HFE gene mutations were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. (1) Prevalence of C282Y HFE mutation was significantly higher in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease compared to controls, the difference being more striking in patients with hyperferritinemia than in those without. (2) The presence of mild iron overload was associated with a lower insulin release. (3) Carriers of C282Y mutation developed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease despite lower body mass index and triglycerides. The mild iron overload associated with heterozygosity for C282Y HFE mutation confers susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, causing relative insulin deficiency.	12779071
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Simultaneous detection of the C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in the hemochromatosis gene using quenched-FRET real-time PCR.	Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas	2008	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal disorder of iron metabolism mainly affecting Caucasian populations. Three recurrent disease-associated mutations have been detected in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE): C282Y, H63D, and S65C. Although HH phenotype has been associated with all three mutations, C282Y is considered the most relevant mutation responsible for hemochromatosis. Clinical complications of HH include cirrhosis of the liver, congestive cardiac failure and cardiac arrhythmias, endocrine pancreatic disease, which can be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, a reliable genotyping method is required for presymptomatic diagnosis. We describe the simultaneous detection of the C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in the hemochromatosis gene by real-time PCR followed by melting curve analysis using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes. The acceptor fluorophore may be replaced by a quencher, increasing multiplex possibilities. Real-time PCR results were compared to the results of sequencing and conventional PCR followed by restriction digestion and detection by agarose gel electrophoresis (PCR-RFLP). Genotypes from 80 individuals obtained both by the conventional PCR-RFLP method and quenched-FRET real-time PCR were in full agreement. Sequencing also confirmed the results obtained by the new method, which proved to be an accurate, rapid and cost-effective diagnostic assay. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of mutations in the HFE gene, which allows a reduction of a significant amount of time in sample processing compared to the PCR-RFLP method, eliminates the use of toxic reagents, reduces the risk of contamination in the laboratory, and enables full process automation.	19030706
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis.	Minerva medica	2008	1.24	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) refers to several inherited disorders of iron metabolism leading to tissue iron overload. Classical HH is associated with mutations in HFE (C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes) and is almost exclusively found in populations of northern European descent. Non-HFE associated HH is caused by mutations in other recently identified genes involved in iron metabolism. Hepcidin is an iron regulatory hormone that inhibits ferroportin-mediated iron export from enterocytes and macrophages. Defective hepcidin gene expression or function may underlie most forms of HH. Target organs and tissues affected by HH include the liver, heart, pancreas, joints, and skin, with cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus representing late signs of disease in patients with markedly elevated liver iron concentration. Compound heterozygotes have milder disease than C282Y homozygotes and clinical signs of HH in these patients are usually associated with other factors such as alcoholism and the dysmetabolic syndrome. The most frequent causes of death in HH are liver cancer, cirrhosis, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes, but patients who undergo successful iron depletion before the development of cirrhosis or diabetes can have normal survival. Classical HH is characterized by incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, and women are less affected than men by iron overload and iron overload-related disease. The diagnosis of HH is established by genetic testing in patients with elevated transferrin saturation values. Patients with an established diagnosis of HH and iron overload should be treated with phlebotomy to achieve body iron depletion followed by maintenance phlebotomy. Population screening for HH is controversial principally because of incomplete penetrance, but screening of selected, high risk populations and first-degree relatives of affected probands may be cost effective.	19034258
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Identification of new mutations of hepcidin and hemojuvelin in patients with HFE C282Y allele.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	HFE-hemochromatosis is the most common form of hereditary hemochromatosis. The disorder is associated with the homozygous C282Y mutation and has variable phenotype, being modulated by environmental and genetic factors. Candidate modifier genes are hemojuvelin and hepcidin, which are responsible for juvenile hemochromatosis. We used DHPLC to scan mutations in these genes in a cohort of unrelated patients with C282Y mutation. They consisted of 136 C282Y homozygous, 43 heterozygous, and 42 C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous, plus 62 controls subjects. Mutations and polymorphisms were found in 16 patients and 4 controls. Abnormally high indices of iron status were found in subjects C282Y/H63D heterozygous for the N196K hemojuvelin mutation and the -72C > T hepcidin substitution. The already described G71D mutation of hepcidin did not induce evident modification of the C282Y/H63D phenotype. The data show that heterozygous mutations of the hemojuvelin gene contribute like those of hepcidin to the phenotypic heterogeneity of hemochromatosis. However, they are rare and explain only a minor portion of the variable penetrance of the disorder.	15528154
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The mitochondrial nt 16189 polymorphism and hereditary hemochromatosis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	It has been claimed that a noncoding mitochondrial polymorphism at nt 16189 is correlated with the penetrance of the homozygous state for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. We have genotyped homozygotes for the C282Y mutation and find no relationship between the ferritin levels and the inheritance of the mitochondrial polymorphism. Indeed, the small difference found is in the opposite direction of that reported previously.	15528155
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Iron overload disease: recent findings].	Annali italiani di medicina interna : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di medicina interna		0.5	Iron overload diseases are due to a progressive increase in total body iron stores that leads to deposition of iron in parenchymal organs and to subsequent damage to these organs. The commonest inherited form of iron overload is hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the white population. Although in the western world and in northern Europe the majority of cases of HH are associated with an HFE gene mutation (C282Y and H63D), there are families with a familial iron overload disorder in whom neither the C282Y nor the H63D mutations were found. Recently, other forms of HH that are not related to HFE, but are due to mutations in genes coding iron transport proteins (ferroportin-1, TfR2, hepcidin) have been described. The clinical presentation of the disorder is highly variable, depending on the severity of iron overload. In fact, the inappropriate absorption and deposition of dietary iron may result in the development of hepatic and non-hepatic end-organ injury, leading to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes, arthritis, skin pigmentation and cardiac diseases. HH and its sequelae are preventable with an early diagnosis and treatment. Patients with evidence of iron overload, a family history of HH or other risk factors should be screened by genotype testing for the HFE mutation. Nowadays, HH is recognized as being a complex genetic disease with probable significant environmental and genetic modifying factors, such as hepatitis C virus infection and alcohol abuse, and it has been shown that HFE mutations represent an independent risk factor for fibrosis and cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis C.	15529941
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene mutations and iron metabolism in celiac disease.	Haematologica	2004	6.67	Iron deficiency anemia is a common manifestation of celiac disease, which may be due to genetic and environmental factors. HFE mutations, frequent in Caucasian populations, can cause increased intestinal iron absorption and thus could protect against the development of iron deficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HFE mutations and their effect on iron metabolism in Italian celiac patients at diagnosis and after a gluten-free diet. C282Y and H63D mutations were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme digestion in 203 patients with celiac disease and in 206 controls. HLA alleles were determined by sequence-specific primers and PCR. Duodenal histology was graded using Marsh's classification, and iron parameters measured by standard techniques. The frequency of the C282Y mutation was similar in celiac patients and controls (0.034 vs. 0.031); comparable frequencies were detected also for the H63D allele (0.170 vs. 0.136 in celiac patients and controls, respectively). Neither of the two HFE mutations affected iron indices in celiac patients at diagnosis, whereas a significant inverse correlation was detected between hemoglobin or ferritin and severity of histological damage (Marsh 3C or 3B vs. 3A, p<0.05 for both parameters). After a gluten-free diet, a slight increase in hemoglobin levels was observed in C282Y carriers as compared to controls, but only in female patients (p=0.044). In Italian patients with untreated celiac disease, HFE mutations do not constitute a protective factor against the development of iron deficiency, which seems to be mainly determined by the severity of the intestinal lesions.	15531451
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The role of HFE mutations on iron metabolism in beta-thalassemia carriers.	Journal of human genetics	2004	2.49	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism characterized by increased iron absorption and progressive storage resulting in organ damage. HFE gene mutations C282Y and H63D are responsible for the majority of HH cases. A third HFE mutation, S65C, has been associated with the development of a mild form of hemochromatosis. The beta-thalassemia trait is characterized by mild, ineffective erythropoiesis that can induce excess iron absorption and ultimately lead to iron overload. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of genetic markers (HFE mutations C282Y, H63D, and S65C) on the iron status of beta-thalassemia carriers. A total of 101 individuals heterozygous for beta-thalassemia and 101 normal control individuals were studied. The allelic frequencies of C282Y (1.5 versus 3.5%), H63D (15.3 versus 18.3%), and S65C (1.0 versus 1.5%) did not differ significantly between beta-thalassemia carriers and normal controls. Serum iron (P=0.029) and transferrin saturation (P=0.009) were increased in beta-thalassemia carriers heterozygous for H63D mutation. The number of subjects carrying C282Y or S65C mutations was too low to conclude their effect on the iron status. These results suggest that the beta-thalassemia trait tends to be aggravated with the coinheritance of H63D mutation, even when present in heterozygosity.	15538648
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Study of patients referred for elevated ferritin levels and/or transferrin saturation: significance of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease].	Gastroenterologia y hepatologia	2004	0.8	To determine the etiology of increased ferritin concentrations and/or transferrin saturation in patients in whom classical causes were ruled out. We studied 43 patients (35 males and 8 females) who were referred for ferritinemia greater than 300 ng/ml and or a transferrin saturation index (TSI) greater than 40%. In all patients, glycemia, cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, total and fractionated bilirubin, transaminase, gammaglutamyltranspeptidase, sideremia, TSI, ferritin, HFE gene mutations, ceruloplasmin and total 24-hour urine porphyrin were evaluated and abdominal ultrasonography was performed. In 14 patients liver biopsy was performed. Fifty-three percent was overweight and 19% was obese. Alterations in carbohydrate metabolism were detected in 33%, hypercholesterolemia was found in 14%, hypertriglyceridemia in 35%, and hyperlipemia type IIb in 16%. Thirty-two percent showed isolated elevated ferritin, 12% had elevated TSI and 56% showed elevation of both. Transaminase levels were normal in 61%. No mutation in the HFE gene was found in 10 patients, the H63D/wt mutation was found in 18, C262Y/wt in 1, C282Y/H63D in 5, C282Y/C282Y in 4, H63D/H63D in 3 and Ser65cys/wt in 1. Ultrasonography revealed steatosis in 19 patients (44%). Definitive diagnoses were HFE-linked hemochromatosis (4 patients), juvenile hemochromatosis (1 patient), hepaticocutaneous porphyria (1 patient), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (22 patients; 51%). Most of the remaining patients could be included under insulin resistance syndrome. Phlebotomy was performed in 25 patients, with improvement in clinical and laboratory parameters. Non-alcoholic fatty acid disease is frequently detected in patients with iron metabolism disorders. These patients should undergo investigations for metabolic alterations and liver ultrasonography and, if necessary, biopsy. Phlebotomy can be useful in the treatment of these patients.	15544735
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Influence of gene polymorphisms in ulcer healing process after superficial venous surgery.	Journal of vascular surgery	2006	3.45	Role of superficial venous surgery in reducing the time it takes for ulcers to heal is still controversial, although all studies confirm a significant reduction in ulcer recurrences. Recently, the HFE-C282Y and FXIII-V34L gene variants demonstrated a role in the risk of venous ulceration in primary chronic venous disorder (CVD) and in modulating lesion size in chronic venous ulcer (CVU), respectively. This study was conducted to investigate the role of HFE-C282Y and FXIII (V34L and P564L) gene variants in ulcer healing time after superficial venous surgery, by assessing the outcome of a cohort of homogeneous CVU patients. The study selected 91 patients affected by primary CVU (CEAP C6, Ep, Asp, Pr), with the exclusion of any other comorbidity factor involved in delayed healing process, who underwent surgery. We assessed the ulcer area and the healing time. Patients were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction for FXIII (V34L and P564L) and for HFE-C282Y substitutions. Globally, CVU cases had a postoperative mean healing time of 8.5 +/- 5.7 weeks. For the subset of cases above and below the median value (M = 8.0 weeks), FXIII-V34L genotype distribution significantly differed (P < .0001). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded specific healing time profiles for the different FXIII-V34L classes of genotype (P = .00001), with an increased risk of delayed healing for the FXIII-VV genotype (hazard ratio, 4.14; 95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 8.2; P = .00005). Although FXIII-P54L genotype distributions did not differ, homozygous 564LL cases (P = .005) and double carriers for both FXIII variants (P < .0001), had a significantly reduced healing time vs wild types. No differences in healing time were observed between carriers and noncarriers of the HFE-C282Y variant, whereas when these cases were stratified by FXIII-V34L genotypes, the L34 carriers had a significantly shorter healing time, irrespective of the HFE genotype. The FXIII-34L variant was significantly associated with shorter healing time after superficial venous surgery, suggesting a role in the healing and tissue regeneration phases. Conversely, HFE-C282Y, despite its role in ulcer establishment, did not affect the postoperative healing time. In perspective, the identification of patients with a poor prognosis may give clinicians the opportunity to modify management and to target tailored therapies in the view of a new and alternative concept of treatment based on pharmacogenomics.	16950433
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations and risk of coronary heart disease in middle-aged women.	European journal of clinical investigation	2006	2.69	Although heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, epidemiological studies remain inconclusive. The aim of the present study was to obtain further evidence as to whether HFE mutations are associated with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in middle-aged women. We used data of a cohort of 15 236 Dutch middle-aged women to investigate whether C282Y carriers and H63D carriers are at increased risk of coronary heart disease compared with non-carriers. Women were included in the study between 1993 and 1997 and were followed until 1 January 2000 for cardiovascular events. HFE genotyping was performed on all 211 coronary heart disease cases and a randomly selected sample from the baseline cohort (n = 1526). A weighted Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate crude, age-adjusted and multivariate adjusted hazard ratios for C282Y and H63D carriership in relation to coronary heart disease. Compared with non-carriers, those that carried the C282Y allele were not at increased risk for CHD (HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.74-2.09). Neither did we find an association between the H63D mutation and CHD risk (HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.43-1.24). Our results are in accordance with similar studies to date, for which we present a meta-analysis. HFE mutations appear not to affect the risk of coronary heart disease.	16968463
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The role of genetic factors in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and iron overload - a prospective series of 234 patients.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2016	4.47	Iron overload (IO) in HFE-related hereditary haemochromatosis is associated with increased risk of liver cancer. This study aimed to investigate the role of other genes involved in hereditary IO among patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with HCC diagnosed in our institution were included in this prospective study. Those with ferritin levels ≥300 μg/L (males) or ≥200 μg/L (females) and/or transferrin saturation ≥50% (males) or ≥45% (females) had liver iron concentration (LIC) evaluated by MRI. HFE C282Y and H63D mutations were screened. Genetic analyses of genes involved in hereditary IO (HFE, HJV/HFE2, HAMP, TFR2, SLC40A1, GNPAT) were performed in patients with increased LIC. A total of 234 patients were included; 215 (92%) had common acquired risk factors of HCC (mainly alcoholism or chronic viral hepatitis). 119 patients had abnormal iron parameters. Twelve (5.1%) were C282Y homozygotes, three were compound C282Y/H63D heterozygotes. LIC was measured by MRI in 100 patients. Thirteen patients with a LIC>70 μmol/g were enrolled in further genetic analyses: two unrelated patients bore the HAMP:c.-153C>T mutation at the heterozygous state, which is associated with increased risk of IO and severe haemochromatosis. Specific haplotypes of SLC40A1 were also studied. Additional genetic risk factors of IO were found in 18 patients (7.7%) among a large series of 234 HCC patients. Screening for IO and the associated at-risk genotypes in patients who have developed HCC, is useful for both determining etiologic diagnosis and enabling family screening and possibly primary prevention in relatives.	26474245
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hemochromatosis].	Zeitschrift fur Rheumatologie	2015	0.57	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a frequent autosomal recessive iron storage disease in northern and western Europe. The classical clinical triad of liver cirrhosis, hyperpigmentation and diabetes is nowadays rare, most probably because of early recognition. The homozygous C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is responsible for most cases of hereditary hemochromatosis, although other much rarer mutations in other genes have been recently identified. Progressive iron overload not only causes liver cirrhosis but also triggers development of a characteristic arthropathy. Bony swelling with intermittent arthritis of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints is typical as well as occurrence of chondrocalcinosis in wrists and knee joints. The therapy of choice is excess iron removal by phlebotomy. Treatment usually prevents or even reverses liver damage but does not alter the course of hemochromatosis arthropathy.	26197713
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The hepcidin gene promoter nc.-1010C > T; -582A > G haplotype modulates serum ferritin in individuals carrying the common H63D mutation in HFE gene.	Annals of hematology	2014	3.02	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe iron overload. It is usually associated with homozygosity for the HFE gene mutation c.845G > A; p.C282Y. However, in some cases, another HFE mutation (c.187C > G; p.H63D) seems to be associated with the disease. Its penetrance is very low, suggesting the possibility of other iron genetic modulators being involved. In this work, we have screened for HAMP promoter polymorphisms in 409 individuals presenting normal or increased serum ferritin levels together with normal or H63D-mutated HFE genotypes. Our results show that the hepcidin gene promoter TG haplotype, originated by linkage of the nc.-1010C > T and nc.-582A > G polymorphisms, is more frequent in the HFE_H63D individuals presenting serum ferritin levels higher than 300 μg/L than in those presenting the HFE_H63D mutation but with normal serum ferritin levels or in the normal control group.Moreover, it was observed that the TG haplotype was associated to increased serum ferritin levels in the overall pool of HFE_H63D individuals. Thus, our data suggest that screening for these polymorphisms could be of interest in order to explain the phenotype. However, this genetic condition seems to have no clinical significance.	25015054
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Testing for haemochromatosis in a liver clinic population: relationship between ethnic origin, HFE gene mutations, liver histology and serum iron markers.	European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	2002	2.09	To identify the most appropriate testing strategy for genetic haemochromatosis in a liver clinic population by determining the ethnic distribution of the HFE mutations and the relationship between serum iron markers, hepatic siderosis and HFE genotype. Observational study of 427 patients being investigated for abnormal liver function tests between 1997 and 2000 attending a liver clinic at a teaching district general hospital in south London, UK. All patients were tested for H63D and C282Y gene mutations, and the ethnic origin was determined. Data were available for most patients for non-fasting serum iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation on presentation and fibrosis and siderosis scores from liver biopsy. The C282Y mutation was not detected in any patients of Asian or Afro-Caribbean origin but was found almost exclusively in northern Europeans, especially those classified as Celtic, one in seven of whom were heterozygous for this mutation. Three per cent of all the patients tested were C282Y homozygotes. The H63D mutation was distributed more widely. An elevated serum transferrin saturation was both a more sensitive and a more specific test for genetic haemochromatosis than either serum ferritin or iron. Significantly raised mean siderosis scores were found on liver biopsy in C282Y homozygote and C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote groups but not in wild-type, simple heterozygote, or H63D homozygote groups. Forty-five per cent of the C282Y homozygotes detected already had cirrhosis. In a multiracial liver clinic population, previously undiagnosed C282Y homozygosity was found to be common (3% in our study) but restricted to those of northern European heritage, particularly those with Celtic ancestry. A serum transferrin saturation proved a better initial test to select patients for genotyping than serum iron or ferritin. Laboratory costs can be minimized with no loss of diagnostic sensitivity by selecting patients for genotyping based on northern European ethnic origin and raised serum transferrin saturation.	11953685
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotype frequencies in consecutive reference laboratory specimens: comparisons among referral sources and association with initial diagnosis.	Genetic testing	2001	0.5	"""We quantified HFE genotype frequencies in specimens submitted by physicians grouped by specialty and determined associations of genotypes with initial diagnosis based on phenotyping in patients evaluated at an iron disorders center. Of 526 specimens (519 from Alabama), these """"typical"""" hemochromatosis-associated genotypes were detected: 85 C282Y/C282Y, 50 C282Y/H63D, and 27 H63D/H63D.

HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A primer for predicting risk of disease in HFE-linked hemochromatosis.	Genetic testing	2001	0.5	Since the discovery of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) in 1996, there has been increasing interest in diagnostic testing for the C282Y and H63D mutations. The high frequency of these two alleles and their incomplete penetrance in homozygotes and compound heterozygotes make genetic counseling for hemochromatosis different from some other autosomal recessive conditions in that parents and children may also be at risk for iron overload, while homozygotes may remain asymptomatic. We provide a guideline for genetic counseling in HFE-linked hemochromatosis based on the genetic probability of inheriting HFE mutations and known information about expression of iron overload in various HFE genotypes. Genetic probabilities were based on allele frequencies derived from large population studies and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium estimates. Expression of iron overload in those of various genotypes was based on available estimates of serum ferritin from population screening studies. Estimates for the likelihood of clinical iron overload requiring follow-up screening or treatment are provided by gender and genotype. The probability of inheriting HFE mutations and developing iron overload can be estimated in family members of a proband with HFE mutations. Many C282Y homozygotes will not have clinical iron overload. The risk is highest in men and their C282Y homozygous brothers and significantly lower in homozygous women. Iron overload is uncommon in compound heterozygotes and H63D homozygotes.	11960576
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association of heterozygous hemochromatosis C282Y gene mutation with hand osteoarthritis.	The Journal of rheumatology	2003	0.5	To determine if there is an association between radiographic osteoarthritis (OA) of the hand and the presence of hemochromatosis HFE gene mutations. One hundred seventy-six patients with radiographic OA of the hand were randomly selected from an academic rheumatology practice. We measured serum transferrin saturation (TS) and ferritin levels, and genotyped for the presence of the 2 common HFE mutations, C282Y and H63D. The prevalences of HFE mutations in these patients were compared to those in a hemochromatosis screening study from the same primary care patient base. There was a significantly increased prevalence of the C282Y mutation in the OA population compared to the unselected controls (12.5 vs 7.8%; p = 0.029). The prevalence of C282Y in OA was higher among older patients: 15.75% in the group older than 65 years versus 4.08% in the younger group. The mean TS level was higher among OA patients who were heterozygous for C282Y compared to those who lacked both HFE mutations (35.75 vs 25.93%; p < 0.0001). This difference was also found in the general population. This is the first report to show an increased risk of OA among individuals who are heterozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation. The increase in this mutation in patients older than 65 suggests that this is associated with a late onset subset of OA. If this association is substantiated by larger randomized controlled studies, it could have major therapeutic implications in the development of specific therapy directed at individuals heterozygous for C282Y HFE mutation.	12508400

The Journal of rheumatology	2003	0.5	Arthropathy is a leading clinical manifestation of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), but involvement of the ankle and hindfoot joints is rare. We describe 3 male patients who presented with symmetrical pain and swelling of the ankles. Radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging showed severe osteoarthritic degenerative changes with a radiological triad of joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and cyst formation. In all 3 cases a homozygous C282Y mutation in the HFE gene was detected and liver biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of HH. Other differential diagnoses could be excluded. Severe arthropathy of the ankle and hindfoot in comparatively young men can be a leading presentation of HH.	12508413
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Rare, but important chronic liver diseases].	Praxis	2002	0.5	The presence of steatosis and inflammatory infiltrate in liver biopsies is essential for the diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). These findings are similar to those with alcoholic liver disease. However, in the NASH-situation alcohol doesn't play an important role. Risk factors for the development of NASH are obesity and diabetes. Most of the patients are clinically asymptomatic. This means, that a diagnosis of NASH is a diagnosis of exclusion: Viral induced, autoimmune, metabolic and toxic liver disease have to be excluded. The disease has a benign clinical course. The risk of cirrhosis is low. So far, there is no established treatment. Preliminary reports suggest a positive effect of weight-loss and ursodeoxycholic acid. Wilson's disease, a copper storage disorder, in which biliary copper excretion is reduced, is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Most patients with Wilson disease become symptomatic between the ages of 6 and 15. In about 90% of patients serum ceruloplasmin levels and serum copper concentrations are reduced. Copper excreation is increased. Histologic examination of liver biopsy specimens reveals fatty infiltration, Mallory bodies and ballooned glycogen nuclei, abnormalities which are also found in alcoholic liver disease. The definitive diagnostic parameter is the quantitative determination of liver copper content (> 250 micrograms/g dryweight). Untreated Wilson disease is always fatal. Lifelong treatment with anti-copper drugs are essential, D-penicillamine being the firstline therapy. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an iron overload disease inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The frequency of the disease is high. The first symptoms usually can be found at the age of 20-50 years. Arthralgia develops in up to 50% of the patients. Many organs are involved, most often the liver. The organ is usually enlarged, transaminases are always moderately elevated. Laboratory findings disclose a marked elevation in serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. More than 80% of HH-patients are homozygous for the C282Y-mutation in the HFE-gene. The firstline treatment of HH is phlebotomy. Treatment is lifelong. When serum ferritin drops below 50 micrograms/l, the frequency of phlebotomy should be reduced (4-12 per year). If the patient already has cirrhosis, the risk of HCC is very high.	12508671
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical relevance of hemochromatosis-related HFE C282Y/H63D gene mutations in patients on chronic dialysis.	Clinical nephrology	2002	1.06	The actual prevalence and the clinical relevance of gene mutations of HFE (which are linked to hemochromatosis) have not yet been established in patients on chronic dialysis. On the basis of theoretical premises, it could be hypothesized that these genetic determinants might influence the response to iron intake and the susceptibility for iron overload in patients in parenteral iron therapy. Furthermore, carriers for these mutations might be prone to develop sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda and cardiovascular events. C282Y/H63D mutations of HFE gene were evaluated in 132 patients (34 in peritoneal dialysis, 98 in HD) and correlated with biochemical parameters of iron status (ferritin (FER) concentration and transferrin saturation (TSAT)), red cell parameters (red cell size and hemoglobin content), erythropoietin (EPO) dosage, major cardiovascular events and C-reactive protein as marker of chronic inflammation, in patients without iron therapy and after i.v. iron supplementation (< or = 60 mg/week) and with the presence of biopsy-proven porphyria. C282Y heterozygous mutation was found in 8/132 (6.6%); H63D homozygous and heterozygous mutations were found in 3/132 (2.3%) and 22/132 (16%) patients, respectively. Two patients (1.5%) showed double heterozygosis. No differences in baseline serum FER and TSAT and the other biochemical and clinical parameters were found in patients bearing mutations alleles nor after continuous iron therapy at low dosages. However, the prevalence of patients capable of maintaining normal hemoglobin (Hb) level without EPO therapy is increased in the C282Y-mutated patients. Only 1 patient out of the 4 with biopsy-proven porphyria cutanea tarda was bearing gene mutations (H63D heterozygosis). C282Y/H63D HFE gene mutations do not seem to be related to major abnormalities in biochemical parameters of iron status in dialysis patients without iron therapy or after i.v. iron supplementation, granted that low dosages are employed. Obviously, as our patients were exposed to a relatively uniform iron regimen in our clinical center (< or = 60 mg/week), it is unclear if other dosing regimens will unmask clinically significant differences between the heterozygotes and normals. The fact that the C282Y-mutated patients more frequently maintain high Hb values without EPO is interesting as could suggest a better use of available iron for erythopoiesis, but needs to be confirmed in larger samples. No clear association is demonstrated with porphyria cutanea tarda and major cardiovascular events.	12508966
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations and hemochromatosis in Danish patients admitted for HFE genotyping.	Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation	2002	0.5	Analysis of the common C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene is widely used to diagnose hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency with which different hospitals and general practitioners select patients for HH genotype and to determine the distribution of HFE mutations in such patients. Nine hundred unrelated patients from Danish hospitals and general practitioners (group A) and 69 consecutive patients from a specialized liver unit (group B) were examined for HFE substitutions using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. In group A we found 13.0% (0%) C282Y homozygotes, 5.8% (2.6%) H63D/C282Y compound heterozygotes and 1.9% (3.1%) S65C heterozygotes. The values for 420 Danish blood donors are shown in parentheses. The distribution of genotypes in group B was similar to that of the blood donors. Serum ferritin, transferrin iron saturation and pathological data were collected from 38 randomly selected C282Y homozygotes, 36 H63D/C282Y compound heterozygotes, 19 H63D heterozygotes, 17 S65C heterozygotes and 144 wild-types. All of the C282Y homozygotes and 28% of the compound heterozygotes were diagnosed as HH patients. There was no evidence of HH in the H63D homozygotes or S65C heterozygotes. Moreover, 7 wild-type patients, 2 C282Y heterozygote patients and one H63D heterozygote patient fulfilled the criteria for HH. The significant enrichment of HH among associated genotype samples submitted for HFE testing indicates that the clinical selection is generally adequate. However, the study showed substantial deviation in the selection efficiency among the various hospitals and general practitioners.	12512743
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Distribution and quantitation of skin iron in primary haemochromatosis: correlation with total body iron stores in patients undergoing phlebotomy.	Acta dermato-venereologica	2014	3.64	Measurement of the concentration of iron in the skin, if correlated with total body iron stores, may enable better informed decisions on when to initiate, change or stop therapy in hereditary heamochromatosis. Naïve haemochromatosis patients with iron overload and with C282Y and/or H63D HFE mutations were evaluated at the following time-points: disease diagnosis, end of the therapy programme, and 6 months after the end of therapy. The distribution and concentration of iron in the skin were assessed by quantitative nuclear microscopy methods, in parallel with serum and plasma iron concentration. Iron content in the liver was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. Iron accumulated in the epidermis; its concentration increased from outer to inner layers, being maximal in the basal layer (7.33 ± 0.98 µmol/g). At all 3 time-points, most of the iron was associated with the extracellular space. During the phlebotomy programme the iron content of the skin and the liver decreased by a factor of 2. These data suggest that measurements of iron concentration in the epidermis, which is a readily accessible tissue, reflect iron overload in the liver.	23728724
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association of ferroportin Q248H polymorphism with elevated levels of serum ferritin in African Americans in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	The ferroportin (FPN1) Q248H polymorphism has been associated with increased serum ferritin (SF) levels in sub-Saharan Africans and in African Americans (AA). AA participants of the HEIRS Study who did not have HFE C282Y or H63D who had elevated initial screening SF (> or =300 microg/L in men and >= or =200 microg/L in women) (defined as cases) were frequency-matched to AA participants with normal SF (defined as controls) to investigate the association of the Q248H with elevated SF. 10.4% of cases and 6.7% of controls were Q248H heterozygotes (P=0.257). Q248H homozygosity was observed in 0.5% of the cases and none of the controls. The frequency of Q248H was higher among men with elevated SF than among control men (P=0.047); corresponding differences were not observed among women. This appeared to be unrelated to self-reports of a previous diagnosis of liver disease. Men with elevated SF were three times more likely than women with elevated SF to have Q248H (P=0.012). There were no significant differences in Q248H frequencies in men and women control participants. We conclude that the frequency of the FPN1 Q248H polymorphism is greater in AA men with elevated SF than in those with normal SF.	17276706
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The H63D variant in the HFE gene predisposes to arthralgia, chondrocalcinosis and osteoarthritis.	Annals of the rheumatic diseases	2007	12.38	To investigate the relation between the HFE C282Y and H63D variants with arthralgia and joint pathology in the population-based Rotterdam Study. From a cohort of 7983 people aged 55 years and over, 2095 randomly drawn subjects were genotyped for C282Y and H63D variants. We compared the frequency of arthralgia, and the presence of chondrocalcinosis, osteophytes, joint space narrowing and radiographic osteoarthritis in hand, hip and knee joints, and Heberden's nodes in carriers of HFE variants with that in non-carriers. Overall, there was a significantly higher frequency of arthralgia (odds ratio 1.6; 95% CI 1.0 to 2.6), oligoarthralgia (2.3; 1.2 to 4.4) and Heberden's nodes (2.0; 1.1 to 3.8) in H63D homozygotes compared with non-carriers. In subjects aged 65 years or younger, H63D homozygotes had significantly more often polyarthralgia (3.1; 1.3 to 7.4), chondrocalcinosis in hip or knee joints (4.7; 1.2 to 18.5), and more hand joints with osteophytes (6.1+/-1.0 vs 4.4+/-0.3), space narrowing (2.8+/-0.5 vs 1.0+/-0.1), radiographic osteoarthritis (4.4+/-0.7 vs 2.0+/-0.2) and Heberden's nodes (3.1; 1.3 to 12.8) than non-carriers. We found no relation of arthralgia or joint pathology to C282Y, but compound heterozygotes had a significantly higher frequency of arthralgia (2.9; 1.0 to 9.3), chondrocalcinosis in hip joints (6.5; 1.8 to 22.3), and an increased number of osteophytes in knee (6.9+/-1.2, n = 5 vs 2.4+/-0.1) joints at a later age (>65 years). The HFE H63D variant may explain, at least in part, the prevalence of arthralgia in multiple joints sites, chondrocalcinosis, and hand osteoarthritis in the general population.	17284543
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Importance of hereditary haemochromatosis in the care of diabetes mellitus].	Orvosi hetilap	2007	0.29	Interactions of iron and carbohydrate metabolism were examined using results of the literature. Special attention was paid to the description of processes involving free radical production because both hereditary haemochromatosis and diabetes mellitus lead to complications by inducing oxidative stress. High levels of blood and tissue glucose produce an excess of electrons. This overload of tissues by electrons may reduce redox-active, non-haeme ferric iron to ferrous one evolving oxidative stress. Hereditary haemochromatosis may cause an elevation in the concentration of the intracellular redox-active iron in both the general and in the diabetic populations. The ratio of carriers (hetero- + homozygotes) of mutations for hereditary haemochromatosis may be as high as 30.4% in the general and 35.8% in the diabetic Hungarian populations. Some data support the possibility that these common forms of hereditary haemochromatosis mutation (HFE-C282Y and HFE-H63D)--even in the heterozygote form--elevate the tissue level of iron without manifesting the phenotype of classical hereditary haemochromatosis. Elevated tissue iron--in patients with already damaged organs due to other diseases e.g. diabetes mellitus--may cause a progression of the complications. On the other hand, hereditary haemochromatosis may lead to endothelial damage and this way hypertension may precede the manifestation of diabetes mellitus. On the basis of these, it may be supposed that elevation of blood pressure should be taken into consideration as one of the earliest clinical symptoms of hereditary haemochromatosis. A therapy-resistant state caused by the hereditary haemochromatosis may be found in diabetes mellitus and hypertension.	17289614
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association of HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) with iron overload in blood donors from Mexico City.	Annals of hepatology		1.81	Iron overload has been associated with HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D). We investigated the association between these mutations and high serum ferritin in a sample of healthy adult men. We enrolled unrelated blood donors from three hospitals in Mexico City in a crosssectional study. Serum ferritin (SF) was determined to define iron overload, and HFE gene mutations were identified by PCR-RFLP. We evaluated 2524 male blood donors and included 246 individuals for each group. We identified 108 individuals with HFE gene mutation, 20.5 % were heterozygote (wt/H63D or wt/C282Y) and the remaining homozygote (H63D/ H63D). The genotype wt/C282Y was observed in two cases, none cases with C282Y/C282Y. The allelic frequency of H63D and C282Y was 0.115 and 0.002, respectively. We observed different association for H63D allele with iron overload (OR 1.54, CI 95 %1.16-2.03) and none in allele C282Y. Although values averages were different, the extreme dispersion of serum ferritin not showed statistically significant differences between H63D and C282Y alleles and ferritin concentrations. The male unrelated blood donors from Mexico City with iron overload prevalence of 13.8% hold similarities with other populations from Europe o America continent, respecting the allele frequency H63D. Nevertheless, allele frequency C282Y is lower than that observed in descendents from northern Europe. We have not observed statistic difference of SF or iron overload frequency by effect of both alleles.	17297430
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis gene sequence deviations in German patients with porphyria cutanea tarda.	Physiological research	2006	1.62	Patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) reveal a susceptibility to reversible inactivation of hepatic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, which might be triggered by alcohol, hepatitis C virus infection, and iron overload. Inherited factors that may predispose to clinically overt PCT also include sequence deviations in the HFE gene that is mutated in classical hemochromatosis. Here, we studied the prevalence of both common and rare hemochromatosis gene variations in 51 PCT patients and 54 healthy controls of German origin. The frequency of the common HFE gene mutation C282Y was 15.7 % in PCT patients and 2.8 % in healthy control individuals (P < 0.001). By contrast, the frequencies of the common H63D mutation did not differ, and the allele frequencies of the less frequently observed sequence deviations as substitution S65C in the HFE gene and mutation Y250X in the TFR2 gene underlying hemochromatosis type 3 (HFE3) were < 0.02 both in PCT patients and controls. Our results comprise the first molecular studies of both common and rare hemochromatosis gene variants in German PCT patients, indicating a significant role of the C282Y mutation in the pathogenesis of PCT.	17298224
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Exome sequencing in HFE C282Y homozygous men with extreme phenotypes identifies a GNPAT variant associated with severe iron overload.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2015	0.5	To identify polymorphisms associated with variability of iron overload severity in HFE-associated hemochromatosis, we performed exome sequencing of DNA from 35 male HFE C282Y homozygotes with either markedly increased iron stores (n = 22; cases) or with normal or mildly increased iron stores (n = 13; controls). The 35 participants, residents of the United States, Canada, and Australia, reported no or light alcohol consumption. Sequencing data included 82,068 single-nucleotide variants, and 10,337 genes were tested for a difference between cases and controls. A variant in the GNPAT gene showed the most significant association with severe iron overload (P = 3 × 10(-6) ; P = 0.033 by the likelihood ratio test after correction for multiple comparisons). Sixteen of twenty-two participants with severe iron overload had glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) polymorphism p.D519G (rs11558492; 15 heterozygotes, one homozygote). No control participant had this polymorphism. To examine functional consequences of GNPAT deficiency, we performed small interfering RNA-based knockdown of GNPAT in the human liver-derived cell line, HepG2/C3A. This knockdown resulted in a >17-fold decrease in expression of the messenger RNA encoding the iron-regulatory hormone, hepcidin. GNPAT p.D519G is associated with a high-iron phenotype in HFE C282Y homozygotes and may participate in hepcidin regulation.	25605615
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Progressive pigmented purpuric dermatitis and alopecia areata as unusual skin manifestations in recognizing hereditary hemochromatosis.	Acta dermatovenerologica Croatica : ADC	2012	0.47	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is a common genetic disorder of iron overload, caused by mutations in the HFE gene. If untreated, abnormal accumulation of iron may lead to organ damage and premature death. Significant changes in the symptomatology of HHC have been observed in recent years, and its full clinical expression is rarely seen. The disorder presents a large phenotypic heterogeneity. We report a case of newly identified HHC in a 56-year-old man presenting as pigmented purpuric dermatitis and alopecia areata affecting the beard, accompanied with elevated liver enzymes and elevated serum ferritin level on screening chemistry panels. Histopathologic examination of skin biopsy revealed changes consistent with the diagnosis of progressive pigmented purpuric dermatitis. The diagnosis of HHC was confirmed by genetic testing, with compound heterozygosity for the C282Y/H63D mutation. He had no signs of cardiomyopathy, gonadal insufficiency, arthropathy, or glucose intolerance. The diagnosis of HHC in our patient was based on clinical findings, laboratory findings, histopathologic examination of skin biopsy and genetic tests. Early diagnosis and therapeutic phlebotomy are very important in the prevention of all known complications of HHC, and are the major determinants of survival. Pigmented purpuric dermatitis and alopecia areata may be unusual early clinical skin presentations of HHC. The relation between inheritance of one or more hemochromatosis genes and susceptibility for progressive pigmented purpuric dermatitis or alopecia areata needs further investigation.	23069304
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis in north-eastern Romania.	Revista medico-chirurgicala a Societatii de Medici si Naturalisti din Iasi		0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disturbance of iron metabolism resulting in iron overload in several organs and their functional failure. Early diagnosis is necessary to start a simple and effective therapy: bleeding. It is the most frequent genetic disease in some populations. Our objectives were 1. An estimate of the expectancy of the disease in the population of our geographic region, and 2. To diagnose the disease by applying the established methods and estimate the efficiency of our diagnosis. 1.To estimate the expectancy, we genotyped 200 persons for the most frequent mutations causing the disease: HFE-C282Y and HFE-H63D by PCR-RFLP. 2. To diagnose the disease phenotypically we determined plasma iron level, ferritin level and transferrin saturation index in 549 patients previously diagnosed as chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis and genotyped those with hemochromatosis phenotype. 1. We found allelic frequencies of 1.75% and 13.25% for the HFE-C282Y and H63D mutant alleles respectively. From these frequencies we calculated that a severe case caused by a C282Y/C282Y homozygote can arise in 816 people and a mild case caused by a C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote can arise in 100 people 2. Among 549 patients we found 10 to have the phenotype of hemochromatosis and 3 out of the 10 were found to carry mutations: two in the HFE gene (one homozygous C282Y and one compound heterozygous C282Y/H63D) and one in the hemojuvelin (HJV) gene (a G320V).	21495455
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of H63D, S65C and C282Y hereditary hemochromatosis gene mutations in Slovenian population by an improved high-throughput genotyping assay.	BMC medical genetics	2007	2.09	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common genetic disease characterized by excessive iron overload that leads to multi-organ failure. Although the most prevalent genotype in HH is homozygosity for C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, two additional mutations, H63D and S65C, appear to be associated with a milder form of HH. The aim of this study was to develop a high-throughput assay for HFE mutations screening based on TaqMan technology and to determine the frequencies of HFE mutations in the Slovenian population. Altogether, 1282 randomly selected blood donors from different Slovenian regions and 21 HH patients were analyzed for the presence of HFE mutations by an in-house developed real-time PCR assay based on TaqMan technology using shorter non-interfering fluorescent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-specific MGB probes. The assay was validated by RFLP analysis and DNA sequencing. The genotyping assay of the H63D, S65C and C282Y mutations in the HFE gene, based on TaqMan technology proved to be fast, reliable, with a high-throughput capability and 100% concordant with genotypes obtained by RFLP and DNA sequencing. The observed frequency of C282Y homozygotes in the group of HH patients was only 48%, others were of the heterogeneous HFE genotype. Among 1282 blood donors tested, the observed H63D, S65C and C282Y allele frequency were 12.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.5-14.2%), 1.8% (95% CI 1.4-2.5%) and 3.6% (95% CI 3.0-4.5%), respectively. Approximately 33% of the tested subjects had at least one of the three HH mutations, and 1% of them were C282Y homozygotes or compound heterozygotes C282Y/H63D or C282Y/S65C, presenting an increased risk for iron overload disease. A significant variation in H63D allele frequency was observed for one of the Slovenian regions. The improved real-time PCR assay for H63D, S65C and C282Y mutations detection is accurate, fast, cost-efficient and ready for routine screening and diagnostic procedures. The genotype frequencies in the Slovenian population agree with those reported for the Central European populations although some deviations where observed in comparison with other populations of Slavic origin. Regional distribution of the mutations should be considered when planning population screening.	18036208
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A novel (Leu183Pro-)mutation in the HFE-gene co-inherited with the Cys282Tyr mutation in two unrelated Dutch hemochromatosis patients.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	We describe a novel heterozygous mutation in exon 3 of the HFE-gene that was co-inherited with Cys282Tyr in two unrelated Dutch men both presenting a classical form of hereditary hemochromatosis. Heterozygosity for this mutation was also found in one out of 100 healthy controls of Dutch descent. This c.548T>C mutation converts a leucine to a proline residue at position 183 in the alpha2-helix of the HFE-protein (Leu183Pro). Standard bioinformatics analysis shows that the mutation is likely to disturb the HFE interaction with TfR1. This disrupting role of the mutation in the iron regulatory pathway is further corroborated by the familial co-occurrence of the observed compound heterozygosity with increased serum iron parameters. Haplotype analysis strongly suggests that this novel mutation arose from a common ancestor in the distant past. These findings may have implications for HFE-testing of iron overloaded heterozygous Cys282Tyr-patients of Northern European origin and their relatives.	18042412
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Protective role of calreticulin in HFE hemochromatosis.	Free radical biology & medicine	2008	0.5	HFE gene mutations are associated with over 80% of cases of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), an iron-overload disease in which the liver is the most frequently affected organ. Research on HFE has traditionally focused on its interaction with the transferrin receptor. More recent studies have suggested a more complex function for this nonclassical MHC-I protein. The aim of this study was to examine how HFE and its two most common mutations affect the expression of selected genes in a hepatocyte-like cell line. Gene expression was analyzed in HepG2 cells overexpressing wild-type and mutant HFE. The effect of HFE in iron import and oxidative stress levels was assessed. Unfolded protein response (UPR)-activated gene expression was analyzed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from characterized HH patients. C282Y HFE down-regulated hepcidin and enhanced calreticulin mRNA expression. Calreticulin levels correlated with intracellular iron increase and were associated with protection from oxidative stress. In C282Y(+/+) patients calreticulin levels correlated with the expression of the UPR marker BiP and showed a negative association with the number of hereditary hemochromatosis clinical manifestations. The data show that expression of C282Y HFE triggers a stress-protective response in HepG2 cells and suggest a role for calreticulin as a modifier of the clinical expression of HH.	18045552
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The unfolded protein response in hereditary haemochromatosis.	Journal of cellular and molecular medicine	2008	4.94	To cope with the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has evolved specific signalling pathways collectively called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Elucidation of the mechanisms governing ER stress signalling has linked this response to the regulation of diverse physiologic processes as well as to the progression of a number of diseases. Interest in hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) has focused on the study of proteins implicated in iron homeostasis and on the identification of new alleles related with the disease. HFE has been amongst the preferred targets of interest, since the discovery that its C282Y mutation was associated with HH. However, the discrepancies between the disease penetrance and the frequency of this mutation have raised the possibility that its contribution to disease progression might go beyond the mere involvement in regulation of cellular iron uptake. Recent findings revealed that activation of the UPR is a feature of HH and that this stress response may be involved in the genesis of immunological anomalies associated with the disease. This review addresses the connection of the UPR with HH, including its role in MHC-I antigen presentation pathway and possible implications for new clinical approaches to HH.	18053083
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Defective release of Hepcidin not defective synthesis is the primary pathogenic mechanism in HFE-Haemochromatosis.	Medical hypotheses	2008	1.14	Recent findings indicate a principal role for Hepcidin in iron homeostasis. Hepcidin is also thought to play a vital role in the pathogenic mechanism of anaemia in patients with inflammation or chronic disease. Under normal conditions influx and efflux of iron from duodenal enterocytes is regulated by Ferroportin. Ferroportin is a Hepcidin binding protein expressed in duodenal enterocytes. Hepcidin is a peptide synthesised in the liver and is the main regulator of iron homeostasis. It is a defensin like protein and exhibits anti-microbial and anti-fungal activity. The Hepcidin gene is principally expressed in hepatocytes but to a lesser extent in neutrophils and macrophages. Hereditary Haemochromatosis is caused by disruption of iron homeostasis due to mutations in the HFE gene (C282Y or H63D). Unrestricted uptake of iron by duodenal enterocytes causes iron overload which is the hallmark of the disease. Current thinking is that defective Hepcidin synthesis or defective iron-sensing mechanisms leading to Hepcidin deficiency is the cause of iron overload in HFE-Haemochromatosis. Thus HFE-Haemochromatosis has been described as an endocrine disease. Basal levels of Hepcidin appear to be normal in HFE-Haemochromatosis patients. This contradicts current theories of defective Hepcidin synthesis as the cause of Hereditary HFE-Haemochromatosis. We propose that the defect in HFE-Haemochromatosis is the loss of Hepcidin surge in response to intake of dietary iron and is not as a result of reduced synthesis.	18054440
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haemochromatosis.	Lancet (London, England)	2007	0.5	Since the discovery of the haemochromatosis gene (HFE; chromosome 6p21.3) associated with haemochromatosis in 1996, many studies about diverse aspects of this common genetic disorder have been done. Some patients present with cirrhosis and show high mortality, whereas many asymptomatic homozygotes for the C282Y mutation in the haemochromatosis gene identified in population screening studies, who have been followed up for many years, do not develop iron overload. Studies described the usefulness of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin tests, and the acceptability of genetic testing for haemochromatosis. Phlebotomy therapy improves hepatic fibrosis. Here, we summarise some new findings in haemochromatosis, a disorder first described in 1865.	18061062
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Liver iron, HFE gene mutations, and hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence in patients with cirrhosis.	Gastroenterology	2008	18.19	The influence of HFE gene mutations and liver iron overload on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurrence in patients with cirrhosis is subjected to controversial results. The aim of this work was to clarify this influence in a large cohort of prospectively followed-up cirrhotic patients classified according to the cause of their liver disease. Three hundred one consecutive cirrhotic patients (162 alcoholics and 139 HCV-infected patients) were included at time of diagnosis of cirrhosis and followed-up. Liver iron overload on initial biopsy according to modified Deugnier's score and C282Y/H63D HFE gene mutations were assessed. In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (mean iron score, 2.0 +/- 3.0; mean time of follow-up, 66.1 +/- 45.1 months), 40 (24.6%) developed HCC. Thirteen (8.02%) were heterozygotes for C282Y HFE gene mutation and had higher hepatic iron scores (3.6 +/- 3.8 vs 1.9 +/- 2.8, respectively, P = .05). In univariate analysis, liver iron overload as a continuous variable (HR, 1.23 [1.13-1.34], P < .001) or in binary coding with an optimal threshold of iron score >/=2.0 (HR, 4.1 [2.1-7.3], P < .0001) and C282Y mutation carriage (HR, 2.7 [1.2-6.3], P = .01) were risk factors for HCC. In multivariate analysis, liver iron and C282Y mutation carriage remained independent risk factors for HCC. In patients with HCV-related cirrhosis (C282Y mutation carriage, 17 [12.23%]; mean liver iron score, 0.9 +/- 1.9; mean time of follow-up, 85.5 +/- 42.1 months; HCC, 63 [45.32%] patients), C282Y mutation carriage and liver iron were not associated with HCC occurrence. Liver iron overload and C282Y mutation are associated with a higher risk of HCC in patients with alcoholic but not HCV-related cirrhosis.	18061182
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The hand arthropathy of hereditary hemochromatosis is strongly associated with iron overload.	The Journal of rheumatology	2008	0.5	To analyze the clinical characteristics and genetic background associated with the presence of hand arthropathy, as determined by radiological findings, in Italian patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC). In 88 consecutive unselected patients with phenotypically expressed HHC, joint involvement was systematically evaluated in plain radiographs of hands, wrists, lumbar spine, pelvis, and knees. Risk factors considered were age, sex, body mass index, alcohol abuse, organ involvement at other sites, and indices of iron overload, including ferritin, transferrin saturation, and iron removed to reach depletion. HFE genotype was also considered. The independent role of risk factors was tested by logistic regression analysis. Thirty-two subjects (36%) showed signs of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) arthropathy. Intercarpal, radiocarpal, and chondrocalcinosis were less frequent and occurred in association with MCP arthropathy. At multivariate analysis MCP arthropathy was independently associated with older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-1.33/yr; p = 0.0001], higher ferritin levels at diagnosis (OR 4.17, 95% CI 1.60-13.9 for values > 1000 ng/ml; p = 0.008), the presence of the C282Y +/+ and C282Y/H63D HFE genotypes (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.09-7.87; p = 0.04), and higher percentage transferrin saturation (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1-1.1; p = 0.05). The severity of arthropathy was independently associated with older age (p = 0.03) and higher ferritin values (p = 0.05). MCP arthropathy together with a typical pattern of joint involvement is observed in one-third of unselected patients with HHC, and is influenced by the duration and degree of the iron overload.	18061976
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Bone Mineral Density in Postmenopausal Women Heterozygous for the C282Y HFE Mutation.	Journal of osteoporosis	2016	0.5	Mutations in the HFE gene may be associated with increased tissue iron stores reflected in an elevated serum ferritin. With homozygous mutation C282Y, the increase in serum ferritin may be associated with tissue damage in the liver, pancreas, and pituitary and with a reduced bone mineral density. With heterozygous mutation C282Y, the degree of iron retention is less but information relating to how a heterozygous C282Y mutation might impact bone mineral density is uncertain. The present study was undertaken to study the relationships between bone mineral density measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and the serum ferritin and serum iron in postmenopausal women heterozygous for the C282Y mutation. The spinal bone mineral density, L2-4, was significantly less than age matched community controls (P = 0.016). There was no significant change in the femoral neck bone mineral density compared to age matched community controls. The correlation between the spinal bone mineral density, L2-4, the femoral neck bone mineral density, and the serum ferritin was not significant. The serum iron correlated significantly inversely with the femoral neck bone mineral density (P = 0.048). The heterozygous C282Y mutation may be associated with impairment of bone cell function in postmenopausal women when only small increases in the serum iron or serum ferritin have occurred.	27123357
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Highly accurate molecular genetic testing for HFE hereditary hemochromatosis: results from 10 years of blinded proficiency surveys by the College of American Pathologists.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics	2016	7.71	The College of American Pathologists offers blinded proficiency testing (PT) for laboratories performing HFE genetic tests for hereditary hemochromatosis (common C282Y and H63D variants). This study used 10 years of PT data to determine laboratory performance for HFE analytical genotyping and clinical interpretation. Laboratories were graded for accuracy of genotype determination (six possible C282Y/H63D genotypes) and clinical interpretation regarding whether the genotype was likely to have contributed to iron overload in a hypothetical patient. The analytical genotyping error rate was low (0.73%) in 7,663 results (from 257 unique laboratories). Genotyping errors were significantly higher in C282Y heterozygous, H63D homozygous, and C282Y homozygous samples, in non-American laboratories, and in laboratories with lower testing volume. Analytical sensitivity and specificity were >98.5 and >99.5%. The interpretive error rate (4.3%) was higher than the genotyping error rate, with two problematic genotypes (C282Y heterozygous and H63D homozygous) accounting for 77% of total interpretive errors. There was a time-dependent improvement in the interpretation of the clinical significance of HFE genotypes. HFE molecular genetic testing, performed by non-US Food and Drug Administration-approved laboratory-developed tests, demonstrated excellent accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Clinical interpretations were more heterogeneous, probably owing to the low clinical penetrance of some common HFE genotypes.Genet Med 18 12, 1206-1213.	27124787
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE C282Y mutation as a genetic modifier influencing disease susceptibility for chronic myeloproliferative disease.	Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology	2009	3.62	Iron metabolism has been implicated in carcinogenesis and several studies assessed the potential role of genetic variants of proteins involved in iron metabolism (HFE C282Y, TFR S142G) in different malignancies. Few reports addressed this issue with relation to chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPD). The aims of our study were (a) to examine the potential associations of CMPD development with genetic modifiers of iron metabolism in a large cohort of CMPD patients; (b) to examine associations of genetic variants of proteins involved in iron metabolism; and acquired JAK2 V617F mutation with clinical characteristics of CMPD. HFE C282Y was genotyped in 328 CMPD patients and 996 blood donors as controls, HFE H63D, and TFR S142G were tested in CMPD patients and 171 first time blood donors. JAK2 V617F mutation was tested in CMPD patients and in 122 repeated blood donors. Decreased C282Y allele frequency (allele frequency+/-95% confidence interval) was found in the CMPD group (1.8%+/-1.0%) compared with controls (3.4%+/-0.8%; P=0.048). TFR S142G allele frequency was reduced among V617F-negative CMPD patients (34.8%+/-7.6%) compared with controls (47.8%+/-5.4%; P=0.02). The frequency of JAK2 V617F was 75.9% (249 of 328) in the CMPD group. At presentation, elevated hemoglobin levels were found in V617F-positive patients compared with V617F-negative counterparts (P<0.000). Vascular complications (26.6% versus 15.2%; P=0.039) as well as female gender (57.4% versus 41.8%; P=0.019) were more common in V617F-positive patients. We found that HFE C282Y might be associated with a protective role against CMPD. Because chronic iron deficiency or latent anemia may trigger disease susceptibility for CMPD, HFE C282Y positivity may be a genetic factor influencing this effect.	19258483
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum ferritin is a clinical biomarker in Japanese patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) independent of HFE gene mutation.	Digestive diseases and sciences	2010	2.52	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver injury. The spectrum of NAFLD is broad, extending from simple steatosis through nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Iron is regarded as a putative element that interacts with oxygen radicals, and high rates of hyperferritinemia and increased hepatic iron stores have been demonstrated in NASH. We investigated serum ferritin concentrations, HFE gene mutations, and insulin resistance in Japanese NASH patients and the diagnostic utility of serum ferritin concentrations as a means of distinguishing NASH. Serum ferritin concentrations were measured in 86 patients with histopathologically verified NAFLD (24 with steatosis and 62 with NASH) and 20 control subjects, they were tested for HFE gene mutations and their insulin resistance was measured. The serum ferritin concentration was significantly higher in the NASH patients than in the patients with simple steatosis (P = 0.006). There was no significant difference between the groups in HFE gene mutation (C282Y, H63D, and S65C), and the serum ferritin level was related with insulin resistance. The area under the ROC curve was 0.732 for distinguishing NASH from simple steatosis (P = 0.005; 95% CI, 0.596-0.856). In conclusion high serum ferritin concentrations are a distinguishing feature of Japanese NASH patients independent of HFE gene mutations.	19267193
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Extrinsic factors modifying expressivity of the HFE variant C282Y, H63D, S65C phenotypes in 1,294 Danish men.	Annals of hematology	2009	3.02	This study analysed the influence of extrinsic factors on the phenotypic expression of HFE gene variants in ethnic Danish men. A cohort of 6,020 men aged 30-53 years was screened for HFE C282Y, H63D and S65C variants. Serum iron, serum transferrin, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin were analysed in 1,452 men and 1,294 men completed a questionnaire on factors, which could influence iron balance. The C282Y allele was present in 5.6%, H63D in 12.8% and S65C in 1.8% of the men. In the entire series, 3% had elevated iron status markers (transferrin saturation > or =50%, ferritin > or =300 microg/L). Self-reported liver disease had an elevating effect and peptic ulcer a lowering effect on iron status markers. Age increased the fraction of men with elevated ferritin from 8.3% at 32-38 years to 16.2% at 46-53 years of age (p = 0.002). Blood donation had a lowering effect on iron status markers (p = 0.0001). Alcohol consumption elevated serum iron and serum ferritin (p = 0.001). Meat consumption had an elevating effect (p = 0.02) and milk consumption a lowering effect (p = 0.03) on serum ferritin. There was no influence of vitamin-mineral tablets on iron status markers. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, the HFE genotype had the highest impact on iron status markers; high alcohol consumption was significantly associated with elevated transferrin saturation. High age and high alcohol consumption were significantly associated with elevated ferritin and high egg consumption and blood donation was significantly associated with normal ferritin levels. In conclusion, the expressivity of HFE variant phenotypes in Danish men was enhanced by alcohol and meat consumption and decreased by milk and egg consumption and blood donation.	19271219
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Non-prescription supplement-induced hepatitis with hyperferritinemia and mutation (H63D) in the HFE gene.	Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology	2008	2.21	A 55-year-old Japanese woman was hospitalized because liver function tests showed an abnormality. Transaminases and biliary enzymes were markedly elevated with hyperferritinemia. Her imaging tests revealed no significant abnormality. She had been taking various non-prescription supplements for over approximately 6 months. After the supplements were discontinued her liver function gradually improved. This clinical course was suggestive of supplement-induced hepatitis. She had no history of taking supplements containing iron, so it was interesting that she had hyperferritinemia. We examined C282Y and H63D, which are important mutations in theiron-metabolizing gene, HFE. She was found to be heterozygous for the H63D mutation. The interaction between hyperferritinemia and supplements is unknown, but it can be speculated that some interaction between iron overload and supplements may have underlain the pathogenesis of her liver injury.	17944940
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE C282Y homozygotes aged 25-29 years at HEIRS Study initial screening.	Genetic testing	2007	0.5	We characterized HFE C282Y homozygotes aged 25-29 years in the HEmochromatosis and IRon Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study using health questionnaire responses, transferrin saturation (TfSat), serum ferritin (SF), and HFE genotyping. In eight homozygotes, we used denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and sequencing to search for HFE2 (= HJV), TFR2, HAMP, SLC40A1 (= FPN1), and FTL mutations. Sixteen of 4,008 White or Hispanic participants aged 25-29 years had C282Y homozygosity (15 White, 1 Hispanic); 15 were previously undiagnosed. Eleven had elevated TfSat; nine had elevated SF. None reported iron overload-associated abnormalities. No deleterious non-HFE mutations were detected. The prevalence of C282Y homozygosity in White or Hispanic HEIRS Study participants aged 25-29 years did not differ significantly from the prevalence of C282Y homozygosity in older White or Hispanic HEIRS Study participants. The prevalences of reports of iron overload-associated abnormalities were not significantly different in these 16 C282Y homozygotes and in HFE wt/wt control participants aged 25-29 years who did not report having hemochromatosis or iron overload. We conclude that C282Y homozygotes aged 25-29 years diagnosed by screening infrequently report having iron overload-associated abnormalities, although some have elevated SF. Screening using an elevated TfSat criterion would fail to detect some C282Y homozygotes aged 25-29 years.	17949288
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The high oxygen-affinity Hemoglobin Johnstown [(beta 109(G11) Val-->Leu] in a German kindred with an elevated erythrocyte hemoglobin content: potential interaction with HFE mutations.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	A 23-year-old man with an elevated blood hemoglobin was found to have hemoglobin (Hb) Johnstown, a high oxygen-affinity hemoglobin and an elevated red cell hemoglobin content. The hemoglobin mutation was present in all family members who consented to molecular investigation. No elevation of the erythropoietin level was found in the carriers. A high ferritin level was observed in one family member. When carriers of the hemoglobin mutation were analyzed for mutations in the HFE-genes (C282Y, H63D and S65C), only the individual with the high ferritin level was a compound heterozygous for the H63D/S65C genotype. This genotype normally does not confer the hemochromatosis phenotype but may contribute to iron overload when present in an individual with increased hemoglobin synthesis. The original report of this hemoglobin variant was in the United States. Additional descriptions followed from Spain and Argentina. The family in this report is the first described in Central Europe carrying the beta109 (Val-->Leu) mutation.	17950634
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations and iron status of Brazilian blood donors.	Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas	2010	0.5	Mutations of the HFE and TFR2 genes have been associated with iron overload. HFE and TFR2 mutations were assessed in blood donors, and the relationship with iron status was evaluated. Subjects (N = 542) were recruited at the Hemocentro da Santa Casa de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. Iron status was not influenced by HFE mutations in women and was independent of blood donation frequency. In contrast, men carrying the HFE 282CY genotype had lower total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) than HFE 282CC genotype carriers. Men who donated blood for the first time and were carriers of the HFE 282CY genotype had higher transferrin saturation values and lower TIBC concentrations than those with the homozygous wild genotype for the HFE C282Y mutation. Moreover, in this group of blood donors, carriers of HFE 63DD plus 63HD genotypes had higher serum ferritin values than those with the homozygous wild genotype for HFE H63D mutation. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that HFE 282CY leads to a 17.21% increase (P = 0.018) and a 83.65% decrease (P = 0.007) in transferrin saturation and TIBC, respectively. In addition, serum ferritin is influenced by age (3.91%, P = 0.001) and the HFE 63HD plus DD genotype (55.84%, P = 0.021). In conclusion, the HFE 282Y and 65C alleles were rare, while the HFE 63D allele was frequent in Brazilian blood donors. The HFE C282Y and H63D mutations were associated with alterations in iron status in blood donors in a gender-dependent manner.	20027482
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations in the HFE gene and cardiovascular disease risk: an individual patient data meta-analysis of 53 880 subjects.	Circulation. Cardiovascular genetics	2008	0.5	Whether mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene increase cardiovascular disease risk is still undetermined. The main reason is the low frequency of the mutations, in particular of the compound C282Y/H63D genotype. We combined the data of 11 observational studies for an individual patient data meta-analysis. Individual patient data were obtained from published as well as unpublished studies that had information available on the C282Y mutation as well as the H63D mutation in relation to coronary heart disease risk. Individual records were provided on each of the 53 880 participants in 11 studies. In total, 10 541 patients with coronary events were documented, of whom 5724 had an acute myocardial infarction. The crude and adjusted association between HFE genotypes and coronary events was examined by logistic regression analysis. We explored potential effect modification of the association between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and coronary events by HFE genotypes. After full adjustment, the odds ratio for coronary heart disease was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.37) for subjects with the compound heterozygous (C282Y/H63D) genotype relative to those with the wild-type/wild-type genotype. The odds ratios for C282Y/C282Y, C282Y/wild-type, H63D/H63D, and H63D/wild-type were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.49 to 1.26), 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.07), 1.16 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.38), and 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.14), respectively. There was no evidence for effect modification. The results of this large individual patient data meta-analysis do not support the view that HFE gene mutations are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease or acute myocardial infarction.	20031541
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE C282Y homozygosity is associated with lower total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: The hemochromatosis and iron overload screening study.	Circulation. Cardiovascular genetics	2009	0.5	Previous studies have suggested a positive association of coronary heart disease risk and both serum ferritin concentrations and C282Y heterozygosity. Relationships between serum lipids, C282Y homozygosity, and serum ferritin have not been well established. The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening study screened 101 168 participants in primary care from 5 field centers in the United States and Canada with serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and HFE genotyping for C282Y and H63D mutations. Serum lipids were measured in a subset of 176 C282Y homozygotes (63 male, 113 female whites) without a prior diagnosis of, family history, or treatment for hemochromatosis and a matched sample of participants with normal transferrin saturation and serum ferritin without C282Y or H63D mutations (wild-type, 123 male, 189 female whites). The proportion of subjects who reported using prescription cholesterol-lowering medications was approximately 3 times higher in HFE wild-type subjects than C282Y homozygotes among men (22% versus 7%; P=0.02) and, in women, 2 times higher (16% versus 8%; P=0.07). After excluding subjects taking cholesterol medications, C282Y homozygotes had significantly lower mean total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations than wild-type subjects, with larger genotypic differences for low-density lipoprotein in men (-0.62 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.93 to -0.33) than in women (-0.28 mmol/L; 95%, CI -0.52 to -0.08). Total mean serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels were lower in C282Y homozygotes than in HFE wild-type participants. Further studies are required to determine whether this is related to iron overload, HFE alleles, or other factors on C282Y-positive chromosome 6p haplotypes.	20031565
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hereditary hemochromatosis].	Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)	2009	0.5	Genetic hemochromatosis is classified into four subtypes of which only type 1 is of clinical importance in Caucasians. Type 1 is due to an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism; the homozygous C282Y mutation of the HFE gene on chromosome 6 accounts for more than 90% of the clinical phenotype in populations of Celtic origin. The mutation leads to an inadequately high intestinal iron absorption which may finally cause iron overload in and damage to various organs. Type 2 is the juvenile form of iron overload which leads to a severe phenotype prior to age 30 with cardiomyopathy and hypogonadism. The corresponding mutations are located in the hemojuveline and hepcidin genes. Typ 3 has mainly been described in Italian families and refers to mutations in transferrin receptor 2 gene. Histopathologic and clinical consequences of type 3 hemochromatosis are similar to those seen in type 1. Types 2 and 3 are autosomal recessive traits. Type 4 hemochromatosis follows an autosomal dominant trait; the corresponding mutation affects the basolateral iron carrier ferroportin 1. Diagnosis of hemochromatosis is based on determinations of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation with the latter being more sensitive and specific. In case of a homozygous C282Y gene test, liver biopsy is not required for diagnosis. Liver biopsy is, however, recommended in C282Y homozygotes at ferritin values > 1,000 ng/ml because of an increased risk for liver fibrosis. Phlebotomy treatment is the standard care to remove iron in genetic hemochromatosis. Patients treated in the early noncirrhotic stage have a normal life expectancy. Thus, future efforts should aim at early diagnosis. Iron removal also improves the outcome in cirrhotic patients. Liver carcinoma may develop in cirrhotic patients despite iron depletion. Liver cancers without cirrhosis are so rare that screening is only recommended in cirrhotic patients.	20039160
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Heterozygous recipient and donor HFE mutations associated with a hereditary haemochromatosis phenotype after liver transplantation.	Gut	2003	14.92	We observed the development of phenotypic hereditary haemochromatosis in a non-hereditary haemochromatosis liver transplant recipient, following transplantation with a liver from a C282Y heterozygous donor. No cause for secondary iron overload was identified. Subsequent sequencing of the HFE gene of both donor and recipient revealed a strong candidate for a novel pathogenic HFE mutation. In the recipient, heterozygosity for a single base substitution in exon 1, g.18 G>C, resulting in the substitution of arginine by serine at codon 6 (R6S), was detected. This R6S variation is likely to represent a novel pathogenic missense mutation of the HFE gene. An interaction between R6S heterozygosity in the recipient and C282Y heterozygosity in the donor liver is the most likely explanation for the development of iron overload in this patient. The report suggests that an hepatic defect is required for expression of hereditary haemochromatosis and that the intestinal HFE genotype is not the exclusive determinant of iron status. It also raises the possibility that a hereditary haemochromatosis phenotype may result from transplantation of C282Y heterozygous donor livers into recipients with heterozygous pathogenic HFE mutations. This possibility may have significant implications for the common practice of transplanting C282Y heterozygous livers.	12584229
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations and chronic hepatitis C: H63D and C282Y heterozygosity are independent risk factors for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.	Journal of hepatology	2003	10.59	The impact of heterozygous HFE mutations on the course of chronic hepatitis C and iron indices was studied. Ferritin, transferrin saturation (TS), serum iron, C282Y and H63D mutations were determined in 401 patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and 295 healthy controls. Liver histologies were available in 217 and HCV genotypes in 339 patients. Allele frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutation did not differ between HCV patients and healthy controls (6.95 vs. 6.2%; 14.75 vs. 16.4%; n.s.). HFE heterozygous HCV patients had higher ferritin (349+/-37 vs. 193+/-15 microg/l; P<0.0005), TS (38+/-2 vs. 32+/-1%; P<0.0005), serum iron (144+/-6 vs. 121+/-3 microg/dl; P<0.0005), semiquantitative liver iron staining (0.26+/-0.07 vs. 0.09+/-0.03; P<0.006) and fibrosis scores (1.9+/-0.2 vs. 1.4+/-0.1; P<0.003) compared to HFE wildtypes. By multivariate regression analysis odds ratios for liver cirrhosis were 5.9 (confidence interval (CI) 1.6-22.6; P<0.009) for C282Y heterozygotes and 2.9 (CI 1.0-8.4; P<0.05) for H63D heterozygotes compared to HFE wildtypes. Considering all HFE heterozygous HCV patients, odds ratios of 3.6 (CI 1.4-9.3; P<0.009) for cirrhosis and 3.1 (CI 1.3-7.3; P<0.009) for fibrosis were calculated. C282Y or H63D heterozygosity is an independent risk factor for liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in HCV infected individuals. Screening for HFE mutations should be considered in HCV infection.	12586300
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations of the HFE gene in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.	The American journal of gastroenterology	2003	0.5	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a late consequence of severe liver disease. Patients with genetic hemochromatosis may be at risk for HCC, but limited information is available on the relationship of HCC and heterozygosity for the HFE gene mutations. HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) were assessed in 162 consecutive patients (131 men/31 women) with HCC. A total of 159 patients had cirrhosis. The most common etiologies of cirrhosis were chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis C 39%, hepatitis B 9%) and alcoholic liver disease (36%). Five patients were C282Y homozygotes, four C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes, and three H63D homozygotes. The C282Y and H63D allele frequencies in HCC were 8.3 (95% confidence limit = 5.3-11.3) and 11.1 (7.8-14.6), respectively, and not different from previously published data in healthy subjects or patients with chronic hepatitis C in Austria. Furthermore, there was no difference in the age at diagnosis in patients with or without HFE gene mutations. C282Y homozygotes had a 19-fold increased risk to develop HCC. In contrast, all other HFE allele constellations were not associated with such a risk. Except for C282Y homozygotes, HFE gene mutations do not increase the risk to develop HCC in patients with cirrhosis.	12591066
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of HFE mutations among the Thai population and correlation with iron loading in haemoglobin E disorder.	European journal of haematology	2004	2.54	Co-inheritance of HFE mutations has a substantial role in iron overload in beta-thalassaemia carriers in north European populations where two HFE mutations, C282Y and H63D, are prevalent. In Thailand, there was little information about the allele frequency of HFE mutations. It is of interest to determine whether such determinants represent a potential risk in developing iron overload as nearly 40% of the Thai population carry either one of thalassaemia or haemoglobinpathy alleles. A total of 380 normal controls from five different regions including Bangkok were screened for the HFE C282Y, H63D and IVS5+1 G-->A alleles. In addition, 70 individuals with homozygous haemoglobin E (Hb EE) were also tested and their genotypes were correlated with levels of serum ferritin. H63D is the major HFE mutation found in the Thai population with an average allele frequency of 3% (range 1-5%). One individual was heterozygous for the splice site mutation IVS5 + 1 G --> A, and the C282Y allele was not detected. In the Hb EE group, five individuals had iron deficiency (ferritin <12 microg/L) and the remaining 65 individuals had a wide range of serum ferritin levels of 16-700 microg/L. Four individuals with Hb EE were heterozygous for the H63D allele. No significant difference in serum ferritin level was detected in this group with or without the HFE mutation (137.2 +/- 78 vs. 116.3 +/- 128 microg/L). HFE mutations are relatively uncommon among the Thai population, and the average allele frequency of the ancient H63D mutation is similar to that of other countries in this region. Because of their paucity, it appears that these alleles are less likely to be responsible for high ferritin levels and iron loading in individuals with Hb E related disorders.	15182337
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Involvement of the major histocompatibility complex region in the genetic regulation of circulating CD8 T-cell numbers in humans.	Tissue antigens	2004	2.05	Variability in T-lymphocyte numbers is partially explained by a genetic regulation. From studies in animal models, it is known that the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is involved in this regulation. In humans, this has not been shown yet. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that genes in the MHC region influence the regulation of T-lymphocyte numbers. Two approaches were used. Association studies between T-cell counts (CD4(+) and CD8(+)) or total lymphocyte counts and HLA class I alleles (A and B) or mutations in the HFE (C282Y and H63D), the hemochromatosis gene, in an unrelated population (n = 264). A second approach was a sibpair correlation analysis of the same T-cell counts in relation to HLA-HFE haplotypes in subjects belonging to 48 hemochromatosis families (n = 456 sibpairs). In the normal population, results showed a strong statistically significant association of the HLA-A*01 with high numbers of CD8(+) T cells and a less powerful association with the HLA-A*24 with low numbers of CD8(+) T cells. Sibpair correlations revealed the most significant correlation for CD8(+) T-cell numbers for sibpairs with HLA-HFE-identical haplotypes. This was not observed for CD4(+) T cells. These results show that the MHC region is involved in the genetic regulation of CD8(+) T-cell numbers in humans. Identification of genes responsible for this control may have important biological and clinical implications.	15191520
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The modified iron avidity index: a promising phenotypic predictor in HFE-related haemochromatosis.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2016	4.47	Phenotypes of the HFE-related haemochromatosis vary considerably, making it hard to predict the course of iron accumulation. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine if the Iron Avidity Index (IAI) is a good phenotypic predictor of the number of phlebotomies needed per year during maintenance treatment (NPDMT) in patients with homozygous p.C282Y hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). Patients with HH homozygous for p.C282Y, on maintenance treatment for at least 1 year were included. The IAI (ferritin level at diagnosis/age at diagnosis) was calculated. Ninety-five patients were included in the analysis. Linear regression analysis showed the confounding effect of sex on the relationship between IAI and NPDMT. A modified IAI, adjusted for sex, was calculated. As proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use was independently associated with NPDMT, the group was split in PPI- and non-PPI-users. A positive correlation between the modified IAI and the NPDMT was shown in both groups (PPI r = 0.367, P = 0.023; non-PPI r = 0.453, P < 0.001). An ROC was computed to measure the accuracy of the modified IAI to predict who needed 0-2 vs. ≥3 maintenance treatments per year. The AUROC in the PPI and non-PPI group were respectively 0.576 (0.368-0.784) and 0.752 (0.606-0.899). The modified IAI is a fairly good predictor in non-PPI-using homozygous C282Y HH patients, to differentiate who needs ≥3 maintenance phlebotomies per year. Therefore, this index might help to select patients that benefit from an alternative less frequent therapy, e.g. erythrocytapheresis.	26992127
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Modification by hemochromatosis gene polymorphisms of the association between traffic-related air pollution and cognition in older men: a cohort study.	Environmental health : a global access science source	2013	3.45	Previous studies found effect modification of associations between traffic-related air pollution and cardiovascular outcomes by polymorphisms in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE). As traffic-related air pollution may impact cognition through effects on cardiovascular health or through mechanisms which may also influence cardiovascular outcomes, we hypothesized that HFE polymorphisms would also modify a previously observed association between traffic-related air pollution exposure and cognition in older men. We considered data from 628 participants of the VA Normative Aging Study. We estimated long term exposure to black carbon (BC), a marker of traffic related air pollution, using a spatio-temporal land use regression model. We assessed cognition using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a test of global function, and performance on a battery of other tests, covering a wide range of domains. We investigated whether variants of HFE C282Y and H63D modified the association between BC and having a low MMSE score using logistic models with generalized estimating equations and multiplicative interaction terms. Similarly, we assessed whether HFE variants modified the association between BC and performance on the cognitive battery using linear mixed models with multiplicative interaction terms. Our results suggest modification of the BC-cognition association by HFE C282Y, although the test of interaction did not achieve statistical significance. In multivariable-adjusted models, participants who lacked a HFE C282Y variant (CC) exhibited an adverse association between BC and total cognition z-score (beta for a doubling in BC concentration: -0.061, 95% CI: -0.115, -0.007), while we did not observe an association in participants with at least one variant genotype (CY or YY) (beta for a doubling in BC concentration: 0.073, 95% CI: -0.081, 0.228; p-value for interaction: 0.11). The pattern of association was similar for analyses considering performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination. There was little evidence to support effect modification of the BC-cognition association by the HFE H63D genotype. Our data suggest that older adults who lack an HFE C282Y variant may be more susceptible to an adverse effect of traffic-related air pollution exposure on cognition. This finding and the proposed biological mechanism require confirmation.	23413885
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis.	American family physician	2013	1.88	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that disrupts the body's regulation of iron. It is the most common genetic disease in whites. Men have a 24-fold increased rate of iron-overload disease compared with women. Persons who are homozygous for the HFE gene mutation C282Y comprise 85 to 90 percent of phenotypically affected persons. End-organ damage or clinical manifestations of hereditary hemochromatosis occur in approximately 10 percent of persons homozygous for C282Y. Symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis are nonspecific and typically absent in the early stages. If present, symptoms may include weakness, lethargy, arthralgias, and impotence. Later manifestations include arthralgias, osteoporosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular cancer, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, and hypogonadism. Diagnosis requires confirmation of increased serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation, with or without symptoms. Subtyping is based on genotypic expression. Serum ferritin measurement is the most useful prognostic indicator of disease severity. Liver biopsy is performed to stage the degree of fibrosis with severe ferritin elevation or transaminitis, or to diagnose nonclassical hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with other genetic defects. Treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis requires phlebotomy, and the frequency is guided by serial measurements of serum ferritin levels and transferrin saturation. Iron avidity can result from overtreatment. If iron avidity is not suspected, it may mimic undertreatment with persistently elevated transferrin saturation. Dietary modification is generally unnecessary. Universal screening for hereditary hemochromatosis is not recommended, but testing should be performed in first-degree relatives of patients with classical HFE-related hemochromatosis, those with evidence of active liver disease, and patients with abnormal iron study results. Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is reserved for those with hereditary hemochromatosis and cirrhosis.	23418762
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effect of ambiguous hemochromatosis gene test results on physician utilization.	Medical care	2012	3.08	Genetic test results may be available to greater numbers of people through genetic screening projects and other means. The effects of widespread genetic testing and notification of genetic test results, particularly added costs through increased physician utilization, have not been clearly established. A primary care-based cohort of 20,306 participants (Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Study, Ontario site) were tested for the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene and for abnormal serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation levels. The primary outcome variable was the total number of physician claims per patient after genetic test notification by mail. Multiple Poisson regression was used to adjust for age, sex, baseline SF, diagnoses of arthritis, diabetes, heart failure and impotence, self-rated health, and the number of claims during the 12 months before notification of results. The reference group had no HFE mutations (wild type) and normal transferrin saturation/SF values. Participants with an ambiguous hemochromatosis gene test and normal iron levels had statistically significantly higher average physician utilization of 3.0%. Participants with HFE mutations (excluding C282Y homozygotes) and elevated iron values showed a 6% increase in physician utilization. The health effects, if any, of increased utilization in heterozygotes or those with mild ferritin elevations are unknown but are unlikely to be large at the population level. Ambiguous genetic test results are associated with increased physician service use and should be considered when assessing the complete societal costs of widespread genetic testing.	22228247
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	ironXS: high-school screening for hereditary haemochromatosis is acceptable and feasible.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2012	4.58	As the results of the Human Genome Project are realised, screening for genetic mutations that predispose to preventable disease is becoming increasingly possible. How and where such screening should best be offered are critical, unanswered questions. This study aimed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of genetic screening for preventable disease, using the model of hereditary haemochromatosis, in high-school students. Screening was offered for the HFE C282Y substitution to 17,638 students. Questionnaires were administered at the time of screening (Q1) and approximately 1 month after results were communicated (Q2). Outcomes assessed were uptake of screening, change in scores of validated anxiety, affect and health perception scales from Q1 to Q2, knowledge and iron indices in C282Y homozygous individuals. A total of 5757 (32.6%) students had screening and 28 C282Y-homozygous individuals (1 in 206) were identified, and none of the 27 individuals who had iron indices measures had significant iron overload. There was no significant change in measures of anxiety, affect or health perception in C282Y homozygous or non-homozygous individuals. Over 86% of students answered each of five knowledge questions correctly at Q1. Genetic population-based screening for a preventable disease can be offered in schools in a way that results in minimal morbidity for those identified at high risk of disease. The results of this study are not only relevant for haemochromatosis, but for other genetic markers of preventable disease such as those for cardiovascular disease and cancer.	22234159
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Regulation of the iron metabolism].	Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke	2009	0.5	The regulation of iron absorption has previously been considered <<an enigma>>. Recent research has given us interesting information on the regulation of the iron metabolism and pathological iron overload; the present article aims at providing an overview of these topics. The article is based on a review of literature retrieved from PubMed. The peptide hepcidin binds to ferroportin on membranes of enterocytes, macrophages and hepatocytes. The complex is internalised and degraded and this results in decreased export of iron to the circulation, and thus a lower level of plasma iron. Hepcidin production is up-regulated in iron overload and down-regulated with iron deficiency. The liver proteins human haemochromatosis protein (HFE), transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2), haemojuvelin (HJV) and bone morphogenetic protein (BNP) are necessary regulators for activation of the hepcidin synthesis. Lack of or mutations in the genes for these proteins, e.g. the HFE mutation C282Y in primary haemochromatosis, reduces the synthesis of hepcidin. Iron regulatory proteins (IRP) may bind to iron responsive elements (IRE) of ferritin-mRNA and transferritin-mRNA and regulate the protein synthesis. Regulation of uptake, utilization, release and storage of iron occurs at the gene level. Hepcidin is currently considered to be the <<key regulator>> of the iron balance. Intracellular iron balance is maintained by iron regulating proteins. Synthesis of ferritin increases with high iron levels, while synthesis of TfR1 is reduced. The opposite occurs with a low iron level.	19415084
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Hemochromatosis--from an underdiagnosed curiosity to a common disease].	Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke	2009	0.5	Hemochromatosis is a common disease with a good prognosis, when diagnosed early and treated appropriately. The aim of this overview is to give updated information on hemochromatosis with special focus on biochemical features, diagnosis and treatment. This article is based on our own experience and a review of available literature in various databases such as PubMed and Medline. Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by iron overload due to increased intestinal iron uptake over many years. Hemochromatosis is often discovered through coincidental detection of high levels of transferrin and/or ferritin. The early symptoms are asthenia and joint pain. About 85 % of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis are homozygote for the C282Y mutation in the HFE: gene, but the majority of homozygotes remain asymptomatic. With ferritin levels > 500 microg/, both hereditary hemochromatosis and iron overload (of unknown cause) are treated with blood-letting. The pathogenesis is not fully elucidated but recent reports indicate that the protein hepcidin (produced in the liver) plays a key role in the development of hemochromatosis. Iron overload may also be secondary to other diseases such as thalassemia and other conditions requiring multiple long-term blood transfusions. The goal is to maintain ferritin values at approximately 20 - 50 microg/L.	19415085
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	CAT53 and HFE alleles in Alzheimer's disease: a putative protective role of the C282Y HFE mutation.	Neuroscience letters	2009	2.11	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder, resulting from an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Several studies addressed the association of AD with MHC class-I polymorphisms without definite conclusions. Considering the remarkable linkage disequilibrium at the MHC region, it is not possible to assume if the reported associations result from a direct effect of the respective genes or result from associations with other closely linked genes transmitted in an extended conserved haplotype. Recent evidence pointed to CAT53, a newly described gene located at the MHC class-I region in the vicinity of HLA-C, as a candidate modifier gene in AD. CAT53 encodes a phosphatase 1 nuclear inhibitor protein and is strongly expressed in brain regions involved in memory and AD. Here we tested the potential association of CAT53 with the risk of developing AD and searched for potential haplotypic associations of CAT53 with two common mutations (H63D, C282Y) in the HFE gene, also located at chromosome 6p21.3. The allele frequencies of these mutations in AD patients were compared to the expected frequencies previously established in the normal Portuguese population. We detected only one polymorphism (G>A) in CAT53, at position 8232, in intron 17. Screening of this polymorphism in 113 AD patients and 82 controls did not show any evidence of association, therefore excluding the hypothetical role of the CAT53 polymorphism as modifier in AD. In contrast, we found a significant negative association of the C282Y HFE mutation with AD, thus supporting a putative protective role of this protein variant in neurodegeneration.	19429178
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutant HFE genotype leads to significant iron overload in patients with liver diseases from western Romania.	Journal of applied genetics	2009	1.93	The present study aimed at assessing the frequency of HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D and S65C) in western Romanian patients with liver disease of diverse aetiologies suspected of iron overload. A total of 21 patients, all Romanian residents hospitalized with clinical suspicion of iron overload and liver disease, were assayed for C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations, serum ferritin and viral hepatitis markers. Overall, 9 out of the 21 patients (42.86%) were found to harbour mutations in the HFE gene: 4 homozygotes C282Y (19.0%), 1 compound heterozygote C282Y/H63D (4.8%), 1 single heterozygote C282Y (4.8%), 2 single heterozygotes H63D (9.5%), 1 single heterozygote S65C (4.8%), and 12 wild-type cases (57.1%). Among the subgroup of 10 patients with the most prominent signs of iron overload (hyperferritinaemia and/or hepatocyte iron score > or = 1), without hepatocellular carcinoma, the HFE genotypes were conclusive in 5 cases (50%). They had significantly increased ferritin levels compared to wild-type cases (P = 0.029). The inclusion of iron studies during routine clinical visits, coupled with the availability of HFE genotyping for family and population studies, should facilitate the early detection of hereditary haemochromatosis in Romania.	19433916
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Heritability of serum iron measures in the hemochromatosis and iron overload screening (HEIRS) family study.	American journal of hematology	2010	5.0	Heritability is the proportion of observed variation in a trait among individuals in a population that is attributable to hereditary factors. The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening family study estimated heritability of serum iron measures. Probands were HFE C282Y homozygotes or non-C282Y homozygotes with elevated transferrin saturation (TS > 50%, men; TS > 45%, women) and serum ferritin concentration (SF > 300 microg/L, men; SF > 200 microg/L, women). Heritability (h(2)) was estimated by variance component analysis of TS, natural logarithm (ln) of SF, and unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC). Participants (N = 942) were 77% Caucasians, 10% Asians, 8% Hispanics, and 5% other race/ethnicities. Average age (SD) was 49 (16) years; 57% were female. For HFE C282Y homozygote probands and their family members, excluding variation due to HFE C282Y and H63D genotype and measured demographic and environmental factors, the residual h(2) (SE) was 0.21 (0.07) for TS, 0.37 (0.08) for ln SF, and 0.34 (0.08) for UIBC (all P < 0.0004 for comparisons with zero). For the non-C282Y homozygote proband group, residual h(2) was significant with a value of 0.64 (0.26) for ln SF (P = 0.0096). In conclusion, serum iron measures have significant heritability components, after excluding known genetic and nongenetic sources of variation.	20095037
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutation H63D in the HFE gene confers risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus but not for chronic complications.	Journal of diabetes and its complications		2.96	To evaluate the frequency of mutations in the HFE gene (C282Y and H63D) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients and their possible association with diabetic chronic complications. A case-control study with 723 subjects was performed. All diabetic subjects (n=519) underwent a clinical and laboratory evaluation. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) was evaluated by an ophthalmologist. Diabetic nephropathy (DN) was categorized by urinary albumin excretion (UAE) as normoalbuminuria (n=247), microalbuminuria (n=68), macroalbuminuria (n=70), or the presence of end-stage renal disease (dialysis; n=134). Data available for blood donors (n=204) were limited to age, sex, body mass index, and absence of previous diagnosis of diabetes and normal fasting plasma glucose. The mutations C282Y and H63D in the HFE gene were genotyped based on PCR protocols and digested with the restriction enzymes SnabI (C282Y) and MboI (H63D). There was an association of type 2 DM with H63D polymorphism (genotypes HD/DD: OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.2-2.6), but not with C282Y polymorphism (OR=0.7, 955 CI=0.4-1.4). In respect to the chronic complications, there was no difference in the prevalence of DR, DN, or ischemic heart disease among the different genotypes. Mutation H63D in the HFE gene was associated with a higher risk of type 2 DM, but did not appear to confer risk for diabetic chronic complications. The mutation C282Y was not associated with diabetes or its chronic complications.	20097100
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE C282Y homozygotes are at increased risk of breast and colorectal cancer.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2010	0.5	The evidence that mutations in the HFE gene for hemochromatosis are associated with increased cancer risk is inconsistent. The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study is a prospective cohort study that commenced recruitment in 1990. Participants born in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, or Ireland (n = 28,509) were genotyped for the HFE C282Y (substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at amino acid 282) variant. Incident cancers were ascertained from Australian cancer registries during an average of 14 years follow-up. Hazard ratios (HRs), confidence intervals (CIs), and P values were obtained from separate Cox regression analyses for colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers, all other solid cancers, and all cancers. Compared to those with no C282Y variant, C282Y homozygotes were at increased risk of colorectal cancer (HR = 2.28; 95% CI = 1.22, 4.25; P = 0.01) and female C282Y homozygotes were at increased risk of developing breast cancer (HR = 2.39; 95% CI = 1.24, 4.61; P = 0.01), but male C282Y homozygotes were not at increased risk for prostate cancer (HR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.43, 2.15; P = 0.92). C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes were not at increased risk for colorectal cancer (HR = 1.27; 95% CI = 0.80, 2.01), breast cancer (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.74, 1.84), or prostate cancer (HR = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.68, 1.70). HFE C282Y homozygotes have twice the risk of colorectal and breast cancer compared with those individuals without the C282Y variant.	20099304
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis in Italy in the last 30 years: role of genetic and acquired factors.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	2010	0.5	The clinical presentation of hereditary hemochromatosis has changed markedly in recent years. The aim of this study was to analyze a large series of consecutive Italian patients with hemochromatosis diagnosed between 1976 and 2007 to determine whether the genetic background and the presence of acquired risk factors influenced the severity of iron overload and the natural history of the disease. A cohort of 452 Italian patients with iron overload-338 HFE-related (C282Y homozygotes or compound C82Y/H63D heterozygotes) and 114 non-HFE-related-were followed prospectively for a median of 112 months. Alcohol intake, smoking habits, and iron removed to depletion were similar in patients with and without HFE-related iron overload. Hepatitis B virus (4% and 9%; P = 0.04) and hepatitis C virus (6% and 19%; P = 0.002) infections were more frequent in patients with non-HFE-related iron overload. Seventy-three percent of patients with HFE and 61% of patients with non-HFE-related disease had no acquired risk factor. Cirrhosis was significantly more frequent in non-HFE patients independent of the presence of acquired risk factors (P = 0.02). Sex, alcohol intake, prevalence of smoking, hepatitis C virus infection, glucose, lipids, iron-related parameters, and prevalence of C282Y/H63D differed significantly over the years. At enrollment, cirrhosis was present in 145 cases and was significantly more frequent in the first decade (80%, 47%, and 13%; P = 0.001). Survival did not differ across the decades in cirrhotic patients; hepatocellular carcinoma occurred similarly in HFE and non-HFE patients. Patients with HFE and non-HFE-related iron overload have comparable iron overload and similar clinical history. Patients who were diagnosed during the last 10 years and were not identified as cirrhotic at enrollment have less severe disease and lower prevalence of acquired risk factors, independent of genetic background.	20101754
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Effects of C282Y, H63D, and S65C HFE gene mutations, diet, and life-style factors on iron status in a general Mediterranean population from Tarragona, Spain.	Annals of hematology	2010	3.02	Mutations in the HFE gene result in iron overload and can produce hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), a disorder of iron metabolism characterized by increased intestinal iron absorption. Dietary quality, alcoholism and other life-style factors can increase the risk of iron overload, especially among genetically at risk populations. Polymorphisms of the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D and S65C) were measured together with serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation (TS) and hemoglobin, to measure iron status, in randomly-selected healthy subjects living in the Spanish Mediterranean coast (n = 815; 425 females, 390 males), 18 to 75 years of age. The intake of dietary components that affect iron absorption was calculated from 3-day dietary records. The presence of C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote that had a prevalence of 2.8% in males and 1.2% in females was associated with an elevated TS and SF. No subject was homozygous for C282Y or S65C. The C282Y heterozygote, H63D heterozygote and homozygote and H63D/S65C compound heterozygote genotypes were associated with increased TS relative to the wild type in the general population. These genotypes together with the alcohol and iron intake increase the indicators of iron status, while calcium intake decreases them. We did not observe any affect of the S65C heterozygote genotype on these levels. All the HFE genotypes except for the S65C heterozygote together with the alcohol, iron and calcium intake affect the indicators of iron status. The C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote genotype has the higher phenotypic expression in our Spanish Mediterranean population.	20107990
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Air pollution and homocysteine: more evidence that oxidative stress-related genes modify effects of particulate air pollution.	Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)	2010	0.5	Ambient particles are associated with cardiovascular events and recently with total plasma homocysteine. High total plasma homocysteine is a risk for human health. However, the biologic mechanisms are not fully understood. One of the putative pathways is through oxidative stress. We aimed to examine whether associations of PM2.5 and black carbon with homocysteine were modified by genotypes including HFE H63D, C282Y, CAT (rs480575, rs1001179, rs2284367, and rs2300181), NQO1 (rs1800566), GSTP1 I105V, GSTM1, GSTT1 (deletion vs. nondeletion), and HMOX-1 (any short vs. both long). We attempted to replicate identified genes in an analysis of heart rate variability and in other outcomes reported in the literature. Study subjects were 1000 white non-Hispanic men in the Boston area, participating in a cohort study of aging. PM2.5, black carbon, total plasma homocysteine, and other covariates were measured at several points in time between 1995 and 2006. We fit mixed models to examine effect modification of genes on associations of pollution with total plasma homocysteine. Interquartile range increases in PM2.5 and black carbon (7-day moving averages) were associated with 1.5% (95% confidence interval = 0.2% to 2.8%) and 2.2% (0.6% to 3.9%) increases in total plasma homocysteine, respectively. GSTT1 and HFE C282Y modified effects of black carbon on total plasma homocysteine, and HFE C282Y and CAT (rs2300181) modified effects of PM2.5 on homocysteine. Several genotypes marginally modified effects of PM2.5 and black carbon on various endpoints. All genes with significant interactions with particulate air pollution had modest main effects on total plasma homocysteine. : Effects of PM2.5 and black carbon on various endpoints appeared to be mediated by genes related to oxidative stress pathways.	20110814
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic and metabolic factors are associated with increased hepatic iron stores in a selected population of p.Cys282Tyr heterozygotes.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2010	0.5	Heterozygosity for p.Cys282YTyr is not ordinarily associated with a hemochromatosis phenotype, unless associated in the compound heterozygous state with other HFE mutations. The aims of the study were to identify factors responsible for iron overload in patients who were only heterozygous for p.Cys282Tyr at first genetic testing. Since 2001, twelve p.Cys282Tyr heterozygous patients with iron overload, defined by increased transferrin saturation, serum ferritin and hepatic iron stores, were identified. Four patients showed rare nonsense or missense HFE mutations in the compound heterozygous state with p.Cys282Tyr. One mutation (p.Gln233X) was never described before. The other 8 patients did not carry any other causal mutations in iron-related genes, but showed a very high prevalence of hepatic steatosis and steato-hepatitis, and metabolic alterations. Serum ferritin levels did not differ between the two groups, but transferrin saturation, hepatic iron amount and distribution significantly did. These last indices should be then strongly considered to decide for additional genetic characterization in p.Cys282Tyr heterozygotes. Our results also highlights the influence of metabolic alterations on serum iron indices and pattern of hepatic iron accumulation.	20117027
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The role of iron overload and HFE gene mutations in the era of pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment of chronic hepatitis C.	Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research	2010	1.4	Iron overload observed in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has been suggested to be one of the negative prognostic factors influencing liver disease progression and failure of treatment with recombinant interferon in monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin. The aim of this study was to assess occurrence of iron overload in relation to polymorphism of the HFE and the influence of both these factors on efficacy of antiviral treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in patients with CHC. Liver function tests, serum indices of iron metabolism, and HFE mutations were assayed in 152 patients with CHC from Poland. Histopathological examination of the liver biopsy specimen was performed in 138 patients. Sixty-one patients were treated with pegylated interferon alfa-2 and ribavirin. The comparative analysis was performed in 2 groups of patients: those with and those without elevated serum indices of iron metabolism. Increased biochemical iron metabolism parameters correlated with older age, higher ALT activity, more advanced liver fibrosis and treatment failure. Iron deposits in liver specimens were not accompanied by exacerbation of necro-inflammatory activity and advanced fibrosis. Elevated biochemical values of iron metabolism parameters and presence of hepatic iron deposits correlated positively with C282Y mutations. The lack of sustained viral response after treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin was observed more frequently in carriers of HFE mutations. Iron overload was frequently detected in patients with CHC, and was associated only with C282Y alleles. Biochemical markers of iron overload and HFE gene mutations were negative prognostic factors of antiviral treatment.	20190684
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Highly sensitivity adhesion molecules detection in hereditary haemochromatosis patients reveals altered expression.	International journal of immunogenetics	2010	1.17	Several abnormalities in the immune status of patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) have been reported, suggesting an imbalance in their immune function. This may include persistent production of, or exposure to, altered immune signalling contributing to the pathogenesis of this disorder. Adhesion molecules L-, E- and P-Selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) are some of the major regulators of the immune processes and altered levels of these proteins have been found in pathological states including cardiovascular diseases, arthritis and liver cancer. The aim of this study was to assess L-, E- and P-Selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in patients with HH and correlate these results with HFE mutation status and iron indexes. A total of 139 subjects were diagnosed with HH (C282Y homozygotes = 87, C282Y/H63D = 26 heterozygotes, H63D homozygotes = 26), 27 healthy control subjects with no HFE mutation (N/N), 18 normal subjects heterozygous for the H63D mutation served as age-sex-matched controls. We observed a significant decrease in L-selectin (P = 0.0002) and increased E-selectin and ICAM-1 (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.0059) expression in HH patients compared with healthy controls. This study observes for the first time that an altered adhesion molecules profile occurs in patients with HH that is associated with specific HFE genetic component for iron overload, suggesting that differential expression of adhesion molecules may play a role in the pathogenesis of HH.	20193033
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene with hepatocellular carcinoma in European populations: a meta-analysis.	Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR	2010	4.36	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder mainly associated with homozygosity for the C282Y and H63D mutations in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene. The reports about the C282Y and H63D mutations and hepatocellular carninoma (HCC) were controversial. To clarify the relationship between C282Y and H63D mutations and HCC, a meta-analysis including nine studies (1102 HCC cases and 3766 controls, mainly came from European populations) was performed. The association was measured using random-effect (RE) or fixed-effect (FE) odds ratios (ORs) combined with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) according to the studies' heterogeneity. Meta-analysis of nine studies showed that Y allele of C282Y was associated with HCC risk: RE OR reached 1.50 (95%CI: 1.05-2.14, p for heterogeneity = 0.02, I2 = 0.57). Subgroup analysis of seven studies also showed Y allele was associated with HCC risk in healthy populations: RE OR reached 1.61 (95%CI: 1.08-2.39, p for heterogeneity = 0.04, I2 = 0.55). We further did subgroup analysis in alcoholic liver cirrhosis (LC) patients of four studies (224 cases and 380 controls) and found that both the dominant model and Y allele of C282Y were associated with HCC risk (FE OR reached 4.06, 95%CI: 2.08-7.92 and 3.41, 95%CI: 1.81-6.41, respectively). There was no distinct heterogeneity among the studies (I2 = 0). Sensitivity analyses showed the results were robust in the subgroup analysis of alcoholic LC patients. C282Y mutation was associated with HCC in European alcoholic LC patients.	20196837
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Population-based study of cystic fibrosis disease severity and haemochromatosis gene mutations.	Respirology (Carlton, Vic.)	2010	0.5	Haemochromatosis (HFE) mutations increase the risk of bowel obstruction in cystic fibrosis (CF), but the impact on other disease manifestations is unknown. We determined the prevalence of HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) in the Tasmanian CF population and assessed the relationship to systemic iron stores, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, lung disease severity and prevalence of diabetes. DNA was obtained from 82 individuals (96% of the entire CF population); 19 (23.2%) were H63D heterozygotes, three (3.7%) were H63D homozygotes and two patients were compound C282Y/H63D (2.4%). Seven (8.5%) patients were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation. Overall, 31 (37.8%) patients carried a HFE mutation. CF patients possessing HFE mutations had significantly better iron stores than non-carriers (P < 0.05). The mean slopes of annual decline in FEV1 and FVC % predicted were significantly steeper in HFE carriers compared with non-carriers (P < 0.01). Patients with HFE mutations were more likely to have had childhood bowel obstruction (RR 2.44, 95% CI: 1.04-5.74, P < 0.05). Diabetes was more common in HFE carriers (RR 2.96, 95% CI: 0.99-8.8, P = 0.05), but this effect attenuated when corrected for age (RR 2.89, 95% CI: 0.91-9.21, P = 0.07). HFE gene mutations modify disease severity in CF, through probable effects on iron homeostasis.	20199637
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency: an examination of cirrhotic explants.	Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc	2010	5.49	Increased iron deposition is often seen in liver explants with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, but it remains unclear if this is a nonspecific effect of end-stage liver disease or if individuals with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and excess iron are at increased risk for HFE mutations. To further examine this question, 45 liver explants with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and 33 control livers with chronic hepatitis C were examined for histological iron accumulation, graded on a scale of 0 to 4+, and HFE mutations. Interestingly, the alpha-1-antitrypsin cirrhotic livers showed a bimodal distribution of iron accumulation, with peaks at grades 1 and 3. In contrast, hepatitis C cirrhotic livers showed a unimodal distribution with a peak at grade 2. HFE mutations in livers with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency were as follows: C282Y=2%, H63D=42%. H63D mutations were more frequent in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency cases than in controls (42 vs 27%), but was not statistically significant, P=0.17. However, there was a significant association with HFE mutations in alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency livers with grade 3+ or 4+ iron, P=0.02. In contrast, livers with hepatitis C showed a similar frequency of HFE mutations as the general population: C282Y=15%, H63D=27%. A rare S65C mutation and a novel A271S mutation were also found in this study; the latter patient had 4+ iron in the liver and later developed heart failure with cardiac iron. In conclusion, total H63D mutations were high (42%) in cirrhotics with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and there was a significant association between HFE mutations and high levels of iron accumulation.	20208481
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	An epidemiologic study on the incidence and significance of HFE mutations in a Korean cohort with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.	Journal of clinical gastroenterology	2010	3.16	The incidence and significance of HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D, and S65C) in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been investigated in Korea. Mutation analysis of HFE gene and measurement of blood iron indices were carried out in 125 NAFLD patients and 221 controls. Neither C282Y nor S65C gene mutations were detected. The prevalence of the H63D mutation was higher in the NAFLD group (14.4%) than in the controls (7.2%) (P=0.032). The estimated odds ratio (OR) of NAFLD for H63D mutations was 3.09 (P=0.008) by multivariate analysis, and age, gender, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia were independent variables associated with NAFLD. However, in the multivariate analysis containing interaction of the types of HFE mutations and gender, the prevalence of the H63D mutation was significantly higher in the male NAFLD group than in the male control group (OR=5.51, P=0.007); the difference of the prevalence between the NAFLD and the control group in females was not significant. The NAFLD patients with H63D mutations had higher levels of TS than those with the wild type (OR=3.14, P=0.048) by the multivariate analysis. A higher TS was significantly associated with the lower body mass index only in the male NAFLD group by multivariate analysis (OR=0.67, P=0.002). The presence of H63D mutations was an independent factor associated with NAFLD and elevated TS. Therefore, the H63D mutation may increase susceptibility to NAFLD probably associated with peripheral iron overload, especially in males.	20216079
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of the C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations of the HFE gene in 1,146 newborns from a region of Northern Spain.	Genetic testing	2004	0.5	In Spain, 85% of patients with genetic hemochromatosis (GH) are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. H63D and S65C mutations of HFE may also play some role in the disease. The aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations of the HFE gene in newborns in Catalonia, Spain. One thousand one hundred forty-six newborn screening cards were selected randomly. DNA from these cards was extracted and HFE mutations were analyzed with the LightCycler equipment (Roche Diagnostics Gmbh, Mannheim, Germany). Sufficient DNA sample was obtained to screen for the three mutations in 1,043 cases (91%). The allelic frequencies of C282Y, H63D, and S65C mutations were 0.03 (IC 95% 0.022-0.037), 0.2 (IC 95% 0.19-0.22), and 0.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.006-0.015), respectively. The frequency of C282Y homozygous newborns was 0.001 (95% CI 0.0005-0.0014). The frequencies of newborns doubly heterozygous for C282Y/H63D and C282Y/S65C were 0.01 (95% CI 0.005-0.02) and 0.002 (95% CI 0.0002-0.01), respectively. The allelic frequency of C282Y mutation is similar to that observed in Southern France, in the Czech Republic and in some areas of Italy. The allelic frequency of H63D mutation in Catalonia is the highest reported to date. Nevertheless, S65C is infrequent. These data should be kept in mind when designing hemochromatosis genotypic screening programs in Catalonia.	15684872
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Juvenile hemochromatosis associated with pathogenic mutations of adult hemochromatosis genes.	Gastroenterology	2005	18.19	Juvenile hemochromatosis is a severe form of hereditary iron overload that has thus far been linked to pathogenic mutations of the gene coding for hemojuvelin (HJV), on chromosome 1, or, more rarely, that coding for hepcidin ( HAMP ), on chromosome 19. A milder adult-onset form is due to pathogenic mutations of HFE or, rarely, serum transferrin receptor 2. We studied a pedigree with siblings affected by both juvenile and adult-onset hereditary hemochromatosis. Affected subjects underwent full clinical evaluation, as well as microsatellite and gene sequencing analysis. Two siblings (male and female, aged 24 and 25 years, respectively) were hospitalized for severe endocrinopathy and cardiomyopathy. At age 18 and 17 years, they had presented with impotence and amenorrhea, respectively, and increased serum iron levels. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism was confirmed in both, and liver biopsy showed marked hepatic iron accumulation and micronodular cirrhosis. Iron levels were normalized after 24 months (female) and 36 months (male) of weekly phlebotomies. Microsatellite analysis showed no linkage with chromosome 1 and 19, and gene sequencing showed no hemojuvelin or hepcidin gene mutations. Instead, combined mutations of HFE (C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity) and serum transferrin receptor 2 (Q317X homozygosity) were found. A 21-year-old brother with a milder phenotype resembling classic adult-onset hereditary hemochromatosis carried only the Q317X serum transferrin receptor 2 homozygote mutation. Juvenile hereditary hemochromatosis is not a distinct monogenic disorder invariably due to hemojuvelin or hepcidin mutations: it may be genetically linked to the adult-onset form of hereditary hemochromatosis.	15685557
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis and femoral head aseptic osteonecrosis: a nonfortuitous association?	The Journal of rheumatology	2005	0.5	Chondrocalcinosis, chronic pseudo-osteoarthritis arthropathy, and osteoporosis are classic osteoarticular complications of hemochromatosis (HC). Within HC, femoral head aseptic osteonecrosis (FHAO) is not notified in textbooks. We describe 3 cases of FHAO occurring in this setting in 3 patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation on HFE gene who had no other risk factors for FHAO. FHAO was diagnosed 9 years before (Case 1), concomitantly with (Case 3), or 9 years after HC (Case 2). In one case, FHAO occurred although phlebotomies were regularly carried out. There are scarce data available in the literature on HC and FHAO. Our observations suggest FHAO may be an indicator for HC, and iron balance should be determined before considering FHAO as idiopathic. Thus phlebotomy may not be protective against the occurrence of FHAO. Studies are needed to determine the prevalence of HC in consecutive patients with FHAO.	15693103
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Soluble transferrin receptor and mutations in hemochromatosis and transferrin genes in a general Catalan population.	Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry	2005	0.5	The measurement of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) has been proposed as a valuable marker of erythropoietic activity and iron status. However, the possibility that mutations in HFE and/or transferrin genes have a direct effect on this parameter has not been sufficiently investigated. The present report addresses this point in the general population. Serum sTfR, ferritin, iron and transferrin, as well as the H63D and the C282Y polymorphisms of the HFE gene and the TF C1/C2 polymorphism of the transferrin gene, were analysed in 348 subjects. We observed significant and independent associations of serum sTfR with sex (2.68+/-1.27 mg/L in men vs. 2.25+/-1.33 in women; P=0.002), H63D polymorphism (2.61+/-1.34 in wild type homozygotes vs. 2.28+/-1.25 in carriers of one or two mutated alleles; P=0.009), and serum iron concentration (r=-0.17; P=0.002). The H63D mutation of the HFE gene has a moderate but significant influence on sTfR concentration in the general population, the presence of one or two mutated alleles being associated with an average of 0.27 mg/L less sTfR than nonmutated homozygotes.	15698609
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Changes in erythropoiesis in hereditary hemochromatosis are not mediated by HFE expression in nucleated red cells.	Haematologica	2005	6.67	The HFE protein interacts with the transferrin receptor (TfR) to regulate cellular iron uptake. Nucleated erythroid cells have the highest number of TfR and the greatest iron uptake. The aim of this study was to investigate whether erythroid iron uptake is directly affected by HFE mutations. Iron status and erythropoiesis was investigated in sixty, asymptomatic HFE C282Y homozygotes. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry were employed to investigate the HFE expression profile of normal peripheral blood, nucleated erythroid cells and several cultured cell lines. The HFE C282Y homozygous subjects showed subtle erythropoietic changes with raised transferrin saturation and reticulocyte counts and low-normal serum transferrin receptor levels, but normal erythrocyte count and mean cell volume. HFE mRNA was detected in macrophages and monocytes and HFE protein was detected in granulocytes and at low levels in monocytes. Cultured primary human erythroid colonies did not express HFE mRNA or protein. There is evidence that HFE C282Y homozygotes display increased plasma iron turnover and increased erythropoiesis, despite there being no evidence that HFE is expressed in erythroid colonies with a normal HFE genotype. It is likely that HFE mutations do not directly alter erythroid iron handling, but alter the supply of iron to the erythroid tissues.	15710569
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Inherited HFE-unrelated hemochromatosis in Italian families.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	1999	0.5	"""Hemochromatosis (HH) is usually caused by the homozygous state for C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. A minority of iron loaded patients have no mutations in this gene. An infrequent subset shows an early-onset aggressive disorder, denoted juvenile hemochromatosis (JH), which has no linkage to 6p. In this report we describe six patients from three unrelated Italian families, four men and two women, aged 21 to 44 with the typical hemochromatosis phenotype, who are homozygous for the wild type allele at the HFE gene. In two families the disorder is unlinked to 6p; in one family some features of the juvenile form are seen, but linkage to 6p is not excluded. Our results point to genetic forms of hemochromatosis not associated with HFE and raise the problem of whether non-HFE hemochromatosis in Italy is related to the """"juvenile"""" form. They also emphasize the importance of phenotypic as well as genetic diagnosis of HH."""	10216143
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary haemochromatosis: diagnosis and management in the gene era.	Liver	1999	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis is a common inherited disorder of iron metabolism in Caucasian populations. Two mutations in the HFE gene are strongly associated with hereditary haemochromatosis. One of these mutations (Cys282-->Tyr; C282Y) is found homozygous in 90-95% of subjects with typical hereditary haemochromatosis. A second mutation (His63-->Asp; H63D) has also been identified but is not associated with the same degree of iron overload as with the C282Y mutation. About 20% of subjects who are heterozygous for both mutations (C282Y, H63D-compound heterozygotes) can express typical hereditary haemochromatosis. A large number of patients with early disease are asymptomatic, and prompt diagnosis and treatment can result in normal life expectancy. The diagnosis can readily be confirmed by serum iron studies and genetic testing. For C282Y homozygotes or compound heterozygotes diagnosed under the age of 40 years and with no biochemical or clinical evidence of liver disease, phlebotomy therapy can be initiated without the need for liver biopsy. Liver biopsy should still be considered in all other patients with iron overload. Screening of first degree relatives should now be based on genotype assessment and measurement of serum iron parameters in order to determine phenotypic expression of the disease.	10220735
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	High prevalence of the Cys282Tyr HFE mutation facilitates an improved diagnostic service for hereditary haemochromatosis in South Africa.	South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde	1999	0.5	The aim of the study was to investigate the molecular basis of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) in South Africa in order to establish a reliable, cost-effective molecular diagnostic service for this potentially lethal disorder. DNA samples of patient and control groups were screened for two common haemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations. The local frequencies of mutations C282Y and H63D were determined and the DNA results correlated with biochemical parameters. Patients were referred from private practitioners, health workers and pathologists for a molecular diagnosis of HH at the University of Stellenbosch Medical School. Twenty-two of the 244 referrals were clinically diagnosed with HH, while the remaining patients were family members of the probands or unrelated subjects referred solely on the basis of an abnormal iron profile. Seventeen of the 22 patient referrals (77%) diagnosed with HH were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, 3 (14%) were compound heterozygotes for mutations C282Y and H63D, and 2 patients (9%) did not exhibit either mutation. Screening of 458 control individuals from the general South African population demonstrated a carrier frequency of approximately 17% for the C282Y mutation among whites, implying that up to 1 out of every 115 South Africans of European descent may be homozygous for this founder-type mutation. Among 64 healthy blood donors of mixed ancestry, we detected 2 individuals heterozygous and 1 homozygous for the C282Y mutation. The detection of mutations C282Y and H63D at a high frequency in the majority of affected South African patients facilitates accurate pre-clinical and confirmatory diagnosis of HH in South Africa. Early detection by DNA screening and subsequent treatment by repeated phlebotomy can prevent disease onset in affected individuals. DNA diagnosis is particularly applicable to a common genetic disease such as HH, which is underdiagnosed and potentially lethal, but treatable.	10226674
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Asymptomatic individuals at genetic risk of haemochromatosis take appropriate steps to prevent disease related to iron overload.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2008	4.47	If community screening for hereditary haemochromatosis is to be considered, compliance with preventative measures and absence of significant psychological morbidity must be demonstrated. Workplace screening for the HFE C282Y mutation and then clinical care for C282Y homozygotes was instituted. Data were collected on understanding of test results, perceived health status and anxiety for C282Y homozygotes compared with controls. Uptake of clinical care, compliance and response to treatment and changes in diet were monitored for up to 4 years for C282Y homozygotes. After 11 307 individuals were screened, 40/47 (85%) newly identified C282Y homozygotes completed questionnaires 12 months after diagnosis compared with 79/126 (63%) of controls. Significantly more C282Y homozygotes correctly remembered their test result compared with controls (95 vs 51%, P<0.0001). No significant difference in perceived health status was observed within or between the two groups at 12 months compared with baseline. Anxiety levels decreased significantly for C282Y homozygotes at 12 months compared with before testing (P<0.05). Forty-five of the 47 (95.8%) C282Y homozygotes accessed clinical care for at least 12 months. All 22 participants requiring therapeutic venesection complied with treatment for at least 12 months (range 12-47 months). Individuals at a high genetic risk of developing haemochromatosis use clinical services appropriately, maintain their health and are not 'worried well'. Population genetic screening for haemochromatosis can be conducted in the work place in a way that is acceptable and beneficial to participants.	18290779
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic predisposition to Parkinson's disease: CYP2D6 and HFE in the Faroe Islands.	Pharmacogenetics and genomics	2008	2.86	To investigate whether the genetic variants of CYP2D6 and HFE are more frequent in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients compared with controls in a population where the prevalence of these variants and PD are increased. Blood samples were collected from 79 PD patients and 154 controls in the Faroe Islands. Genotyping for the 'CYP2D6*3, *4, *6 and *9' alleles and for the C282Y and H63D mutations were performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction before Taqman assessment. The frequency of CYP2D6 poor metabolizers among the patients was not higher compared with the frequency found in the control group (chi2 test, P=0.86). The odds ratio was 0.92 (95% confidence interval: 0.44-1.90). Neither was a difference in HFE genotype or allele frequencies found between the patients and the controls, and the C282Y and H63D mutation carrier frequencies did not reveal any difference (chi2 test, P=0.50 and 0.60, respectively). This study does not support an association between PD and mutations of the CYP2D6 and HFE genes, although a weak association cannot be excluded. The high frequency of PD in the Faroes is most likely the result of interactions between multiple genetic and environmental factors, still to be identified.	18300942
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Wild-type HFE protein normalizes transferrin iron accumulation in macrophages from subjects with hereditary hemochromatosis.	Blood	2000	11.84	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HC) is one of the most common single-gene hereditary diseases. A phenotypic hallmark of HC is low iron in reticuloendothelial cells in spite of body iron overload. Most patients with HC have the same mutation, a change of cysteine at position 282 to tyrosine (C282Y) in the HFE protein. The role of HFE in iron metabolism and the basis for the phenotypic abnormalities of HC are not understood. To clarify the role of HFE in the phenotypic expression of HC, we studied monocytes-macrophages from subjects carrying the C282Y mutation in the HFE protein and clinically expressing HC and transfected them with wild-type HFE by using an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain as a gene carrier. The Salmonella system allowed us to deliver genes of interest specifically to monocytes-macrophages with high transduction efficiency. The accumulation of (55)Fe delivered by (55)Fe-Tf was significantly lower in macrophages from patients with HC than from controls expressing wild-type HFE. Transfection of HC macrophages with the HFE gene resulted in a high level of expression of HFE protein at the cell surface. The accumulation of (55)Fe delivered by (55)Fe-Tf was raised by 40% to 60%, and this was reflected by an increase in the (55)Fe-ferritin pool within the HFE-transfected cells. These results suggest that the iron-deficient phenotype of HC macrophages is a direct effect of the HFE mutation, and they demonstrate a role for HFE in the accumulation of iron in these cells.	10910932
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Carriage of HFE mutations and outcome of surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients.	Cancer	2000	5.65	Aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicates frequently hereditary hemochromatosis, a disease for which a strong candidate gene, named HFE, has recently been identified. Patients with HCC who are heterozygotes for mutations in the HFE gene might have distinct features and a distinct disease course. The presence of the 2 mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (C282Y and H63D) was sought by restriction fragment length polymorphism in 61 cirrhotic patients (46 males and 15 females) who underwent resection for HCC at a single institution. There were 4 heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation and 6 homozygotes + 20 heterozygotes for the H63D mutation, with no compound heterozygotes. Carriage of >/= 1 HFE mutated allele was significantly more frequent in HCC patients than in 149 control subjects (44% vs. 29%, P = 0.005). Among C282Y heterozygotes, 3 of 4 were female, compared with 12 of 57 wild-type carriers (P = 0.015); no gender distribution existed among patients carrying H63D alleles (6 of 26 vs. 9 of 35, P = 0.813). Survival was longer for patients with wild-type HFE than for those with mutated HFE (67% vs. 22% at 3 years; hazard ratio = 0.42, 95% confidence interval = 0.21-0.80) (P < 0.01). The negative effect on survival that resulted from possessing >/= 1 HFE mutated allele was maintained even after adjustment for gender, age, presence of tumor capsule, presence of comorbid factors, Okuda stage, Edmonson grading, and number of lesions (P = 0.01). Testing for HFE mutations may help identify HCC patients with dismal prognoses for whom surgical resection may not represent the best treatment option.	10918159
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Genetic hemochromatosis and the HFE gene: from molecular genetics to clinical diagnosis].	Zeitschrift fur Gastroenterologie	2000	1.36	More than 90% of patients with genetic hemochromatosis carry a characteristic mutation in the HFE-gene (C282Y). HFE modulates the iron uptake by the transferrin receptor. Duodenal crypt cells of HFE-knockout mice show low intracellular iron concentrations which lead to an upregulation of the divalent metal transporter and enhanced iron uptake by duodenal enterocytes. Heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation appears to alter the course of other liver diseases like porphyria cutanea tarda and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.	10923364

The American journal of gastroenterology	2000	0.5	Hepatic iron overload is observed in many forms of chronic liver disease. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) results in hepatic iron overload and is associated with 2 missense mutations in the HFE gene. The aim of this study was to define the usefulness of the histological pattern of iron deposition in determining the probability of an iron-loaded patient having HFE-related iron overload. This study assessed liver biopsies containing stainable iron from 103 patients with various liver diseases; clinical information included hepatic iron concentration and HFE genotype (C282Y, H63D). The biopsies were evaluated using a reproducible histological scoring system for iron deposition. Three separate components of histological iron deposition were recorded: 1) pattern (primarily hepatocellular with a zonal gradient, or reticuloendothelial without an obvious zonal gradient), 2) pattern score to denote the extent of iron within the acinus, and 3) quantitation grade of iron granules within affected hepatocytes. The predominantly hepatocellular pattern (HH pattern) was observed in 72 biopsies of which only 42 were from patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation, indicating that this pattern alone cannot be used as a surrogate marker for HH genotype. The predominantly reticuloendothelial pattern (non-HH pattern) was observed in the remaining 31 patients, none of whom was compound heterozygous or homozygous for the C282Y mutation (negative predictive value: 100%). Thus, the non-HH, reticuloendothelial pattern reliably predicts the absence of homozygosity for the C282Y mutation. The use of histological evaluation for iron deposition is simple, assists in expanding information communicated from histopathologic observations, and may be clinically useful in determining the necessity of further evaluation of HFE genotype in subjects with histological evidence of hepatic iron overload.	10925986
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Two novel nonsense mutations of HFE gene in five unrelated italian patients with hemochromatosis.	Gastroenterology	2000	18.19	Most hemochromatosis patients of Northern European descent are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of HFE gene. In Italy, many patients with iron overload are not homozygous for C282Y, and the presence of other mutations or other genetic determinant has been suggested. Five unrelated Italian patients heterozygous for C282Y with the classic hemochromatosis phenotype were studied. The entire coding sequence and the exon-intron boundaries of the HFE gene were analyzed. Chromosome 6p haplotypes were defined in each patient by analysis of D6S265, D6S105, and D6S1281 microsatellites. Two novel nonsense HFE mutations were identified in exon 3 in the C282Y negative chromosome. The first one, a G-to-T transition at codon 168, was detected in 3 probands; the second, a G-to-A transition at codon 169, was detected in the others. The 2 nonsense mutations in the compound heterozygous state with C282Y result in the classic hemochromatosis phenotype in several unrelated Italian patients. This confirms that hemochromatosis in Italy is not as homogeneous as in northern Europe and suggests that other mutations can exist in C282Y or H63D heterozygotes with iron overload. These findings have practical implications for diagnostic and screening strategies for hemochromatosis.	10930379
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron-overload and genotypic expression of HFE mutations H63D/C282Y and transferrin receptor Hin6I and BanI polymorphism in german patients with hereditary haemochromatosis.	European journal of immunogenetics : official journal of the British Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics	2000	0.5	Gene variations of HFE, a HLA-class I like molecule, are highly associated with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH). Functional as well as molecular studies of the HFE protein have indicated that the molecule is involved in iron metabolism and that the HFE gene variations observed among HH patients affect its interaction with the transferrin receptor (TfR). In the present study, we have therefore analysed the relationship between the HFE gene variants, C282Y and H63D, and body iron status among 85 German HH patients. In addition, two TfR gene polymorphism, TfR-Hin6I and TfR-BanI, were typed that have been reported to define ethnically distinct haplotypes. As controls we used 251/159 healthy German blood donors. Seventy-eight (92%) patients were C292Y homozygous, the H63D mutation was present in five (6%) patients with none of the patients being H63D homozygous. Serum transferrin, transferrin saturation and liver iron content were determined prior to therapeutic intervention. Among C282Y homozygous patients serum ferritin levels (2294 +/- 3174 vs. 463 +/- 224 microg L-1, P < 0.0001) and transferrin saturation (86 +/- 18% vs. 62 +/- 25%, P = 0.048) were elevated significantly compared with C282Y and/or H63D heterozygous patients. In addition, the liver iron content (291 +/- 165 vs. 138 +/- 95 micromol g-1, P = 0.028) and liver iron index (6.4 +/- 2.8 vs. 3.2 +/- 2.3, P = 0.019) were increased among C282Y homozygotes compared with C282Y heterozygotes. In contrast, no difference was observed between patients and controls regarding the distribution of TfR-Hin6I and TfR-BanI alleles. These data indicate that the iron intake is higher among C282Y homozygous patients compared with C282Y heterozygous or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous individuals and supports the functional role of the HFE protein in iron metabolism whereas the TfR gene variants seem to have no influence on iron uptake.	10940080
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Impact of hemochromatosis gene mutations on cardiac status in doxorubicin-treated survivors of childhood high-risk leukemia.	Cancer	2013	5.65	Doxorubicin is associated with progressive cardiac dysfunction, possibly through the formation of doxorubicin-iron complexes leading to free-radical injury. The authors determined the frequency of hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis and their relationship with doxorubicin-associated cardiotoxicity in survivors of childhood high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Peripheral blood was tested for 2 common HFE allelic variants: C282Y and H63D. Serum cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), which are biomarkers of cardiac injury and cardiomyopathy, respectively, were assayed during therapy. Left ventricular (LV) structure and function were assessed with echocardiography. A total of 184 patients had DNA results for at least 1 variant, and 167 had DNA results for both: 24% carried H63D and 10% carried C282Y. Heterozygous C282Y genotype was associated with multiple elevations in cTnT concentrations (P = .039), but not NT-proBNP. At a median of 2.2 years (range, 1.0 years-3.6 years) after diagnosis, the mean Z-scores for LV fractional shortening (-0.71 [standard error (SE), 0.25]; P = .008), mass (-0.84 [SE, 0.17]; P < .001), and end-systolic (-4.36 [SE, 0.26], P < .001) and end-diastolic (-0.68 [SE, 0.25]; P = .01) posterior wall thickness were found to be abnormal in children with either allele (n = 32). Noncarriers (n = 63) also were found to have below-normal LV mass (-0.45 [SE, 0.15]; P = .006) and end-systolic posterior wall thickness (-4.06 [SE, 0.17]; P < .001). Later follow-up demonstrated similar results. Doxorubicin-associated myocardial injury was associated with C282Y HFE carriers. Although LV mass and wall thickness were found to be abnormally low overall, they were even lower in HFE carriers, who also had reduced LV function. Screening newly diagnosed cancer patients for HFE mutations may identify those at risk for doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.	23861158
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations in Caucasian participants of the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening study with serum ferritin level <1000 µg/L.	Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie	2013	0.5	Many patients referred for an elevated serum ferritin level <1000 µg⁄L are advised that they likely have iron overload and hemochromatosis. To determine the prevalence of HFE mutations in the hemochromatosis gene for 11 serum ferritin concentration intervals from 200 µg⁄L to 1000 µg⁄L in Caucasian participants in a primary care, population-based study. The Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening study screened 99,711 participants for serum ferritin levels, transferrin saturation and genetic testing for the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene. This analysis was confined to 17,160 male and 27,465 female Caucasian participants because the HFE C282Y mutation is rare in other races. Post-test likelihood was calculated for prediction of C282Y homozygosity from a ferritin interval. A subgroup analysis was performed in participants with both an elevated serum ferritin level and transferrin saturation. There were 3359 male and 2416 female participants with an elevated serum ferritin level (200 µg⁄L to 1000 µg⁄L for women, 300 µg⁄L to 1000 µg⁄L for men). There were 69 male (2.1%) and 87 female (3.6%) C282Y homozygotes, and the probability of being a homozygote increased as the ferritin level increased. Post-test likelihood values were 0.3% to 16% in men and 0.3% to 30.4% in women. Iron loading HFE mutations are unlikely to be the most common cause of an elevated serum ferritin level in patients with mild hyperferritinemia. Patients should be advised that there are many causes of an elevated serum ferritin level including iron overload.	23862168
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Coinheritance of hereditary spherocytosis and reversibility of cirrhosis in a young female patient with hereditary hemochromatosis.	European journal of medical research	2009	1.68	Here we report a 33-years-old woman with hereditary spherocytosis and hemochromatosis due to homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. The coinheritance of both conditions led to severe iron overload and liver cirrhosis at young age. The patient was treated by repeated phlebotomy, and reversibility of cirrhosis was documented by transient elastography. This report discusses the pathophysiology of iron accumulation in patients with hemolytic anemia combined with HFE C282Y homozygosity. The case indicates that patients with hematological disorders characterized by increased erythropoetic activity should be screened for HFE mutations.	19380292
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Marked iron in liver explants in the absence of major hereditary hemochromatosis gene defects: a risk factor for cardiac failure.	Transplantation	2009	3.69	Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis are known to have an increased risk for morbidity and mortality after orthotopic liver transplantation. The clinical, histological, and genetic findings were examined in a series of seven adult patients with marked iron accumulation in their liver explants and cardiac failure despite the absence of HFE mutations. Causes for cirrhosis were alcohol and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (n=2), HCV (n=1), alcohol (n=1), and cryptogenic cirrhosis (n=3). Ages at transplantation ranged from 46 to 62 years. Genetic studies confirmed all seven cases were negative for HFE mutations C282Y and H63D. The liver explants showed marked iron accumulation that predominately involved hepatocytes, with more than 90% of the iron in hepatocytes. Two patients required cardiac transplantation and four died of cardiac failure. Cardiac tissues obtained from autopsies (n=3), endomyocardial biopsy (n=1), or cardiac transplants (n=2) showed marked myocyte hypertrophy and iron deposits with or without interstitial fibrosis. This study highlights a unique set of liver transplant patients with marked iron deposition in their cirrhotic liver who developed severe cardiac failure and have iron deposits in the heart, despite the absence of major HFE gene mutations. The cause of the systemic iron overload remains to be discovered.	19384175
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Body iron stores and glucose intolerance in premenopausal women: role of hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and genomic variants related to inflammation, oxidative stress, and iron metabolism.	Diabetes care	2009	8.93	OBJECTIVE Increased serum ferritin levels and iron stores may be involved in the development of abnormal glucose tolerance in women presenting with obesity and/or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We aimed to study the determinants of serum ferritin levels in premenopausal women among indexes of insulin resistance, adiposity, hyperandrogenism, and genotypes pertaining to inflammation, oxidative stress, and iron metabolism. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 257 premenopausal women, classified depending on the presence or absence of PCOS, obesity, and/or abnormal glucose tolerance, underwent a complete metabolic evaluation, serum ferritin, haptoglobin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements, and genotyping for proinflammatory and prooxidant variants and mutations in the HFE gene. RESULTS Serum ferritin concentrations were increased in women presenting with PCOS and/or abnormal glucose tolerance, independent of obesity. A stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis (R(2) = 0.18, P < 0.0001) retained menstrual dysfunction (beta = 0.14, P = 0.035), free testosterone (beta = 0.14, P = 0.052), insulin sensitivity index (beta = -0.12, P = 0.012), the His63Asp variant in HFE (beta = 0.16, P = 0.008), and abnormal glucose tolerance (beta = 0.15, P = 0.015) as significant predictors of the logarithm of ferritin levels, whereas CRP, haptoglobin, waist-to-hip ratio, or variants in the TNFalpha, TNFRSF1B, IL6, IL6ST, IL6Ralpha, PON1, and HFE Cys282Tyr mutation exerted no influence. CONCLUSIONS Androgen excess (partly because of hyperandrogenemia and partly because of menstrual dysfunction), insulin resistance, abnormal glucose tolerance, and the HFE His63Asp variant correlate with ferritin levels in premenopausal women.	19401444
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Haplotype analysis of the HFE gene among populations of Northern Eurasia, in patients with metabolic disorders or stomach cancer, and in long-lived people.	BMC genetics	2016	2.15	Previously, it was shown that the HFE gene (associated with human hereditary hemochromatosis) has several haplotypes of intronic polymorphisms. Some haplotype frequencies are race specific and hence can be used in phylogenetic analysis. We assumed that analysis of Caucasoid patients-living now in Western Siberia and having diseases associated with dietary habits and metabolic rate-will allow us to understand the processes of possible selection during settling of the northern part of Asia. Haplotype analysis of Northern Eurasian native and recently settled ethnic groups was performed on polymorphisms rs1799945, rs1800730, rs1800562, rs2071303, rs1800708, rs1572982, rs2794719, rs807209, and rs2032451 of this gene. The CCA haplotype of the rs2071303, rs1800708, and rs1572982 was found to be associated with HLA-A2 (39 %) in Asian populations. Haplotype analysis for the rs1799945, rs1800730, rs1800562, rs2071303, rs1800708, and rs1572982 was performed on Russian patients with some metabolic disorders or stomach cancer and among long-lived people. Decreased frequencies of the TTA haplotype (T in rs2071303, T in rs1800708, and A in rs1572982) were observed in the groups of patients with diseases associated with overweight (fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or metabolic syndrome + arterial hypertension) as compared with the control sample. We detected significant differences in this haplotype's frequency between the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and Russian adolescents, elderly citizens, and long-lived people (χ(2) P value = 0.003, 0.010, and 0.015, respectively). No significant differences in frequencies of the alleles with mutations in coding regions of the HFE gene (C282Y, H63D, and S65C) were detected between the analyzed patients (with stomach cancer, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus) and the control Caucasoid sample. Monophyletic origin of H63D (rs1799945) was confirmed in Caucasoids and Northern Asians. The reasons for a sharp increase in the frequency of CCA haplotype of HFE in the Asian race remain unclear.	27317329
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Impact of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations on epithelial ovarian cancer risk and prognosis.	International journal of cancer	2011	5.53	Cancer cells require large amounts of micronutrients, particularly iron, for their rapid growth and frequent divisions. Cellular iron uptake is regulated by the transferrin receptor and the hemochromatosis protein (HFE) system. Two frequent mutations in the HFE gene, H63D and C282Y, are associated with hemochromatosis type I, an inherited iron overload disease and, possibly, with cancer. In this study, we evaluated the frequency of the H63D and C282Y mutations in a cohort of 677 consecutive cases of woman with gynecological pathologies. Cases included 80 women with tumor-free pathologies normal ovary (NOV), 124 with benign ovarian tumors (BOV), 96 with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tumors of low malignant potential (LPM), 264 with invasive tumors of the ovary (TOV) and 113 with endometrial cancer. We found that the C282Y allele frequency in EOC patients was higher than that in the control NOV group (5.8% vs. 1.3%, p < 0.001) and was associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer (OR = 4.88; 95% CI 1.15-20.61; p = 0.018). The effect of the two HFE mutations on patient survival was also analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analyses did not find any significant association between the H63D allele and patient survival. However, EOC patients with at least one C282Y allele had a decreased overall survival compared to those with no C282Y allele (p = 0.001). These results indicate that the C282Y mutation may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer and may be further associated with poor outcomes.	20669231
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE) genotypes in heart failure: relation to etiology and prognosis.	BMC medical genetics	2010	2.09	It is believed that hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) might play a role in cardiac disease (heart failure (HF) and ischemia). Mutations within several genes are HH-associated, the most common being the HFE gene. In a large cohort of HF patients, we sought to determine the etiological role and the prognostic significance of HFE genotypes. We studied 667 HF patients (72.7% men) with depressed systolic function, enrolled in a multicentre trial with a follow-up period of up to 5 years. All were genotyped for the known HFE variants C282Y, H63D and S65C. The genotype and allele frequencies in the HF group were similar to the frequencies determined in the general Danish population. In multivariable analysis mortality was not predicted by C282Y-carrier status (HR 1.2, 95% CI: 0.8-1.7); H63D-carrier status (HR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.7-1.3); nor S65C-carrier status (HR 1.2, 95% CI: 0.7-2.0). We identified 27 (4.1%) homozygous or compound heterozygous carriers of HFE variants. None of these carriers had a clinical presentation suggesting hemochromatosis, but hemoglobin and ferritin levels were higher than in the rest of the cohort. Furthermore, a trend towards reduced mortality was seen in this group in univariate analyses (HR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.9, p = 0.03), but not in multivariate (HR 0.5, 95% CI: 0.2-1.2). HFE genotypes do not seem to be a significant contributor to the etiology of heart failure in Denmark. HFE variants do not affect mortality in HF.	20670400
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Do genetic variations in antioxidant enzymes influence the course of hereditary hemochromatosis?	Antioxidants & redox signaling	2011	7.09	Iron-induced oxidative stress promotes hepatic injury in hereditary hemochromatosis, which can be influenced by genetic traits affecting antioxidant enzymes. We assessed the influence of Ala16Val-superoxide dismutase 2, Pro198Leu-glutathione peroxidase 1, and -463G/A-myeloperoxidase genotypes (high activity for the Ala, Pro, and G alleles, respectively) on the risks of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients homozygous for the C282Y-hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutation. Both the 2G-myeloperoxidase genotype and carriage of one or two copies of the Ala-superoxide dismutase 2 allele were more frequent in patients with cirrhosis or HCC. Patients cumulating these two genetic traits had higher rates of cirrhosis and HCC than other patients.	20673159
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron metabolism in macrophages from HFE hemochromatosis patients.	Molecular genetics and metabolism		3.09	HFE-linked hereditary hemochromatosis is a common form of iron-overload disease in European populations. We studied the role of HFE in macrophage iron metabolism. Patients under venesection treatment had higher EPO levels and drastically reduced levels of transferrin receptor (TfRC and TfR2) mRNA, and also decreased levels of HAMP mRNA in macrophages cultured in autologous serum. Macrophages from C282Y/C282Y patients cultured either in autologous serum or in FBS with or without iron supplementation, had elevated CYBRD1 (cytochrome b reductase 1), SLC40A1 (ferroportin) and FTL (ferritin L) mRNA levels. Those incubated with holo-Tf also showed lower levels of TfRC and TfR2 mRNA. Iron flux from C282Y/C282Y macrophages incubated with a low concentration of non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) was similar to that from wild-type macrophages, but incubation with holo-Tf or high NTBI did not trigger a continuous increase in the cytosolic calcein-chelatable iron pool in C282Y/C282Y macrophages conversely to wild-type cells. All culture conditions revealed a high level of intracellular ferritin in C282Y/C282Y macrophages compared to wild-type cells. These results suggest that the non-functional C282Y form of HFE may alter the balance between cytosolic calcein-chelatable iron and sequestered iron, thereby disrupting the iron uptake and release equilibrium in cells involved in iron storage.	20675164
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Blunted hepcidin response to oral iron challenge in HFE-related hemochromatosis.	Blood	2007	11.84	Inadequate hepcidin synthesis leads to iron overload in HFE-related hemochromatosis. We explored the regulation of hepcidin by iron in 88 hemochromatosis patients (61 C282Y/C282Y, 27 C282Y/H63D) and 23 healthy controls by analyzing urinary hepcidin before and 24 hours after a 65-mg oral iron dose. Thirty-four patients were studied at diagnosis and had iron overload, and 54 patients were iron depleted. At diagnosis, hepcidin values in C282Y homozygotes were similar to controls, whereas values in C282Y/H63D heterozygotes were higher (P = .02). However, the hepcidin/ferritin ratio was decreased in both homozygotes (P < .001) and heterozygotes (P = .017), confirming the inadequate hepcidin production for the iron load with both genotypes. In iron-depleted patients of both genotypes studied at a time remote from phlebotomy, basal hepcidin was still lower than in controls (P < .001 for C282Y/C282Y and P = .002 for heterozygotes). After an iron challenge, mean urinary hepcidin excretion increased in controls (P = .001) but not patients, irrespective of genotype and iron status. Significant hepcidin increase ( > or = 10 ng/mg creatinine) was observed in 74% of controls, 15% of homozygotes, and 32% of heterozygotes. The hepcidin response to oral iron is blunted in HFE-related hemochromatosis and not improved after iron depletion. The findings support the involvement of HFE in iron sensing and subsequent regulation of hepcidin.	17724144
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Characteristics of participants with self-reported hemochromatosis or iron overload at HEIRS study initial screening.	American journal of hematology	2008	5.0	There are few descriptions of young adults with self-reported hemochromatosis or iron overload (H/IO). We analyzed initial screening data in 7,343 HEmochromatosis and IRon Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study participants ages 25-29 years, including race/ethnicity and health information; transferrin saturation (TS) and ferritin (SF) measurements; and HFE C282Y and H63D genotypes. We used denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography and sequencing to detect mutations in HJV, TFR2, HAMP, SLC40A1, and FTL. Fifty-one participants reported previous H/IO; 23 (45%) reported medical conditions associated with H/IO. Prevalences of reports of arthritis, diabetes, liver disease or liver cancer, heart failure, fertility problems or impotence, and blood relatives with H/IO were significantly greater in participants with previous H/IO reports than in those without. Only 7.8% of the 51 participants with previous H/IO reports had elevated TS; 13.7% had elevated SF. Only one participant had C282Y homozygosity. Three participants aged 25-29 years were heterozygous for potentially deleterious mutations in HFE2, TFR2, and HAMP promoter, respectively. Prevalences of self-reported conditions, screening iron phenotypes, and C282Y homozygosity were similar in 1,165 participants aged 30 years or greater who reported previous H/IO. We conclude that persons who report previous H/IO diagnoses in screening programs are unlikely to have H/IO phenotypes or genotypes. Previous H/IO reports in some participants could be explained by treatment that induced iron depletion before initial screening, misdiagnosis, or participant misunderstanding of their physician or the initial screening questionnaire.	17726683
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association studies between haemochromatosis gene mutations and the risk of cardiovascular diseases.	European journal of clinical investigation	2001	2.69	Haemochromatosis is a common genetic disorder, inherited as an autosomal recessive trait that results in a progressive accumulation of iron in most tissues of the body. Positive association studies have been recently published between cardiovascular diseases and heterozygosity for the major mutation C282Y in the haemochromatosis gene HFE. In the present work, we have determined the HFE genotypes for C282Y and H63D in subjects from two case-control studies: the ECTIM and GENIC studies, designed to identify genetic variants associated with myocardial and brain infarction, respectively. In addition, we tested whether HFE mutations were associated with the degree of arteriosclerosis assessed non-invasively by Doppler ultrasonography on the carotid and femoral arteries, in a group of apparently healthy individuals (the AXA Study). The prevalence of 282Y, and 63D allele carriers, did not differ between cases and controls in the ECTIM and in the GENIC studies, while 63D but not 282Y carriers were more numerous among subjects with atherosclerotic plaques in the AXA Study. These three studies do not provide consistent evidence supporting the hypothesis that HFE mutations are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and with the development of arteriosclerosis.	11380589
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of the hemochromatosis C282Y and H63D mutations in a Polish population of Slavic origin.	Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research		1.4	Hereditary hemochromatosis is one of the most common monogenic diseases among Caucasians. The most frequent mutation causing hemochromatosis is C282Y in the HFE gene, the highest frequency of which has been observed in populations of Celtic origin. There are no studies providing information about the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene in populations of Slavic origin. We collected 871 healthy unrelated subjects in Poland to assess the relevant frequencies. Each subject was genotyped for the C282Y and H63D mutations using a PCR-based protocol. Among the analysed subjects 6.0% were CY heterozygotes, and only one person was YY homozygote. The observed frequency of the 282Y allele was 3.1%. The frequency of the D allele of the H63D polymorphism was 16.2%. There were 13 (1.5%) compound heterozygotes for C282Y and H63D found in the analysed group. The high frequency of the Y allele in this Polish population of non-Celtic origin may indicate an early introduction of this mutation through admixture with a strong positive selection.	11386022
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency and biochemical expression of C282Y/H63D hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations in the healthy adult population in Italy.	Journal of hepatology	2001	10.59	The actual prevalence of the main hemochromatosis (HFE) mutations in the Italian adult population and their phenotypic expression have not yet been established. This information is key to advocate a mass-screening program. Two thousand one hundred adults were tested for the C282Y/H63D HFE gene mutations by an automated genotyping assay as well as transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin levels. No homozygotes for the C282Y mutation were found. Heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation was 3.1%, while heterozygosity and homozygosity for the H63D mutation were 21.5% and 2.5%, respectively. TS was significantly higher in C282Y heterozygotes and H63D homozygotes as compared to wild-type individuals (P < 0.01). Interestingly, of the HFE wild-type subjects 5.9% had a TS value above the 45% threshold. This study shows that (i) the predicted prevalence for C282Y homozygosity in Italy is 1:3900; (ii) the C282Y/H63D wild-type population has an increased baseline of iron parameters possibly due to genetic factors not linked to the C282Y/H63D mutations; (iii) since in the latter population the actual tissue iron burden cannot be assessed, phenotypic (TS) screening in Italy is not recommended until the true prevalence of all mutations in the HFE gene and in other hemochromatosis genes will be established.	11394651

Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics		7.71	To determine the contribution of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene to clinical expression of hereditary hemochromatosis. Pooled analysis of 14 case-control studies reporting HFE genotype data, to evaluate the association of different HFE genotypes with iron overload. In addition, we used data from the pooled analysis and published data to estimate the penetrance of the C282Y/C282Y genotype. Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation carried the largest risk for iron overload (OR = 4383, 95% CI 1374 to >10,000) and accounted for the majority of hemochromatosis cases (attributable fraction (AF) = 0.73). Risks for other genotypes were much smaller: OR = 32 for genotype C282Y/H63D (95% CI 18.5 to 55.4, AF = 0.06); OR = 5.7 for H63D/H63D (95% CI 3.2 to 10.1, AF = 0.01); OR = 4.1 for C282Y heterozygosity (95% CI 2.9 to 5.8, with heterogeneity in study results, making this association uncertain); and OR = 1.6 for H63D heterozygosity (95% CI 1 to 2.6, AF = 0.03). Estimates of penetrance for the C282Y/C282Y genotype were highly sensitive to estimates of the prevalence of iron overload disease. At a prevalence of 2.5 per 1000 or less, penetrance of the C282Y/C282Y genotype is unlikely to exceed 50%. Penetrance of other HFE genotypes is much lower. C282Y homozygosity confers the highest risk for iron overload but the H63D mutation is also associated with increased risk. Our data indicate a gradient of risk associated with different HFE genotypes and thus suggest the presence of other modifiers, either genetic or environmental, that contribute to the clinical expression of hemochromatosis.	11399207
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Current Clinical Practice: Hereditary Haemochromatosis: Recent Advances in Biology and Management.	Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	1999	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder leading to excessive absorption of dietary iron. The gene affected in the common variety has recently been identified near the HLA-A locus on chromosome 6 and designated HFE. The HFE mutation, C282Y, responsible for most cases of HH is found in as many as 8-18% of people of European descent; 6-32 per 1000 are therefore homozygous, but only a variable proportion accumulate enough iron to develop organ damage with the associated clinical manifestations. Clinical expression depends on the amount of absorbable iron in the diet, the amount of iron being lost (greater in women through menstruation and pregnancies) and the severity of the genetic defect. The excess iron can be removed by serial phlebotomies. In symptomatic individuals this reverses some of the manifestations and prolongs survival significantly; if treatment is instituted before symptoms appear all manifestations are prevented. The objective must therefore be to identify and treat affected individuals in the presymptomatic stage. In this context, the role of population screening is currently being debated.	11399563
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations do not account for transfusional iron overload in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.	Transfusion	2001	3.04	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a HFE gene-linked disorder affecting 1 of 200 to 400 persons in white populations. It has been proposed that patients with a hematologic malignancy who are receiving frequent RBC transfusions should be screened for HFE mutations. This would identify C282Y homozygotes, who have a high risk of developing severe iron overload. DNA samples from 128 controls and 23 adult long-term survivors of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated at the Oulu University Hospital (Oulu, Finland) from 1987 to 2000 were examined for the presence of the C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE. All the patients were severely iron-overloaded, as determined from high serum ferritin values and/or increased storage iron in bone marrow. Phlebotomies were performed in five patients because of the symptoms of iron overload. DNA extracted from the blood was used to amplify HFE gene fragments by the PCR method, after which the amplification products were digested with restriction endonucleases SnaB I and Bcl I, and the restriction fragments were analyzed on agarose gels. No chromosomes with the C282Y mutation were found among the AML patients, and 5 patients (21.7%) were heterozygous for the H63D mutation. In the control group, 13 persons (10.2%) were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation and 26 (20.3%) for the H63D mutation, including 3 C282Y/H63D double heterozygotes. HFE mutations do not account for the harmful iron overload that develops in AML patients who receive large quantities of RBC concentrates after intensive chemotherapy.	11399828
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Two novel missense mutations of the HFE gene (I105T and G93R) and identification of the S65C mutation in Alabama hemochromatosis probands.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	"""Sequencing of HFE exons 2, 3, 4, and 5, and of portions of introns 2, 4, and 5 revealed novel mutations in four of twenty hemochromatosis probands who lacked C282Y homozygosity, C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity, or H63D homozygosity. Probands 1 and 2 were heterozygous for previously undescribed mutations: exon 2, nt 314T-->C (314C; I105T), and exon 2, nt 277G-->(277C; G93R), respectively; these probands were also heterozygous for H63D and C282Y, respectively. Probands 3 and 4 were heterozygous for a previously described but uncommon HFE mutation: exon 2, nt 193A-->T (193T; S65C). Proband 3 was also heterozygous for C282Y and had porphyria cutanea tarda, and Proband 4 had hereditary stomatocytosis. Each of these four probands had iron overload. In each proband with an uncommon HFE coding region mutation, I105T, G93R, and S65C occurred on separate chromosomes from those with the C282Y or H63D mutations. Neither I105T, G93R, nor S65C occurred as spontaneous mutations in our probands. The I105T and G93R mutations were linked to haplotypes bearing HLA-A3,-B7 and HLA-A2,-B62, respectively. The S65C mutation was linked to a haplotype characterized by HLA-32. Sixteen other probands did not have an uncommon HFE exon mutation. In 176 normal control subjects, two were heterozygous for S65C, but I105T and G93R were not detected. Nine of twenty probands were heterozygous and two probands were homozygous for a previously described base-pair change at intron 2, nt 3671T-->C. One proband without a detectable missense mutation had a previously described intron 5 allele (nt 6700G-->A). Heterozygosity for a previously described base-pair change in intron 4 (nt 5636T-->C) was detected in all persons we studied who also had the S65C mutation. One proband was heterozygous for a previously undescribed base-pair change at intron 5 (nt 5807A-->G). We conclude that uncommon HFE exon and intron mutations may be discovered among hemochromatosis patients who have """"atypical"""" HFE genotypes."""	10575540
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Significance of linkage disequilibrium between mutation C282Y and a MseI polymorphism in population screening and DNA diagnosis of hemochromatosis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	An increasing number of studies demonstrate a lack of phenotypic expression in subjects found to be homozygous for the common hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) mutation, C282Y. In this study the impact of possible overestimation of C282Y homozygosity, as a consequence of a MseI polymorphism identified in intron 4 of the HFE gene, was investigated in South African subjects. Utilization of a modified polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay highlighted the potential implications with respect to genotype/phenotype correlation studies, particularly in the general population. Mistyping rather than lack of disease association provides a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of C282Y homozygosity without iron overload. Reassessment of C282Y mutation status in such cases may result in justified population screening in HH.	10575550
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Determinants of iron status and bilirubin levels in congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I.	British journal of haematology	1999	5.4	Seven untransfused patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I were investigated to assess the determinants of both iron overload and serum bilirubin levels. The serum ferritin concentration was increased in all patients and non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) was increased in all but one patient. None of the patients showed the C282Y mutation in the hereditary haemochromatosis gene, HFE. One patient was homozygous for the H63D mutation in this gene. The data indicated that differences in the extent of iron overload were not mediated by co-inheritance of the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene but could largely be explained by differences in the severity of anaemia and ineffective erythropoiesis, and in the age of the patient. In one patient an unusually high plasma bilirubin level was associated with the variant A[TA]7TAA configuration in the TATA box of the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT-1A) gene promoter, the mutation found in most patients with mild Gilbert's syndrome.	10583252
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[A new method of molecular testing in the differential diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis].	Orvosi hetilap	1999	0.29	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal, recessive disorder of the iron metabolism. The hemochromatosis gene (HFE) was previously located on chromosome 6 and recently identified by positional cloning. A point mutation, C282Y, was found to be present in the HFE gene in homozygous form in 64 to 100% of patients with established hemochromatosis. The relationship of a second polymorphic variant of the HFE gene, H63D to the formation of iron overload is debated. Although hemochromatosis is one of the most common inherited disorders among Caucasians, in the absence of specific signs it is rarely diagnosed. In order to obtain comparable epidemiological data for Hungary, we tested 1271 and 277 randomly selected, unrelated, healthy subjects for C282Y and H63D respectively. In addition C282Y testing was carried out in 58 patients suffering from liver cirrhosis, and in 191 individuals with suspected hemochromatosis. For C282Y and H63D mutation analyses polymerase chain reaction technique followed by Rsa I and Bcl I restriction enzyme digestion was used. We developed an alternative method for the detection of C282Y based on an amplification-generated Kpn I restriction site. The allele frequencies were 3.8% and 12.3% for C282Y and H63D respectively in the normal Hungarian population. There was no significant difference in C282Y allele frequencies between liver disease patients (1.7%) and the normal population. We identified 15 homozygous and 25 heterozygous individuals among 191 individuals with suspected hemochromatosis. The C282Y and the H63D allele frequencies in the normal Hungarian population were found to be similar to the allele frequencies observed in other European populations, indicating that there is a large number of individuals susceptible for iron overload in Hungary (1:700). Mutation analysis is a novel, non-invasive method in the diagnostics of hereditary hemochromatosis, which increasingly becomes part of the routine clinical work.	10586619
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[The usefulness of the detection of Cys282Tyr and His63Asp mutations in the diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis].	Revista clinica espanola	1999	0.76	Hemochromatosis is a hereditary disease the diagnosis and early therapy of which is particularly relevant to prevent the appearance of complications. In 1996, the gene responsible for this condition was identified and was named HFE. To determine the prevalence of Cys282Tyr (C282Y) and His63Asp (H63D) mutations in the HFE gene in a group of patients with the confirmed diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis, as well as in a control group of 174 healthy individuals. Twenty-two patients with the diagnosis of primary hemochromatosis who were on treatment with periodic phlebotomies were studied. All patients had the following parameters measured: serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, serology for hepatitis viruses B and C, liver function tests, abdominal echography and liver biopsy. A control group of 174 healthy individuals, who had their serotype analyzed, was also studied. Eighteen (81.8%) of patients with hemochromatosis were homozygous for the C282Y mutation. One patient was homozygous for the H63D mutation and in other patient no mutation was found. Among individuals in the control group, the allelic frequency of the C282Y mutation was 2.3%, whereas the allelic frequency of the H63D mutation was 19.8%. The results obtained in our study support the evident association between the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene and hereditary hemochromatosis in our environment.	10589245
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The haemochromatosis protein HFE induces an apparent iron-deficient phenotype in H1299 cells that is not corrected by co-expression of beta 2-microglobulin.	The Biochemical journal	2003	0.5	HFE, an atypical MHC class I type molecule, has a critical, yet still elusive function in the regulation of systemic iron metabolism. HFE mutations are linked to hereditary haemochromatosis type 1, a common autosomal recessive disorder of iron overload. Most patients are homozygous for a C282Y point mutation that abrogates the interaction of HFE with beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)M) and, thus, impairs its proper processing and expression on the cell surface. An H63D substitution is also associated with disease. To investigate the function of HFE we have generated clones of human H1299 lung cancer cells that express wild-type, C282Y or H63D HFE under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Consistent with earlier observations in other cell lines, the expression of wild-type or H63D, but not C282Y, HFE induces an apparent iron-deficient phenotype, manifested in the activation of iron-regulatory protein and concomitant increase in transferrin receptor levels and decrease in ferritin content. This phenotype persists in cells expressing wild-type HFE after transfection with a beta(2)M cDNA. Whereas endogenous beta(2)M is sufficient for the presentation of at least a fraction of chimeric HFE on the cell surface, this effect is stimulated by approx. 2.8-fold in beta(2)M transfectants. The co-expression of exogenous beta(2)M does not significantly affect the half-life of HFE. These results suggest that the apparent iron-deficient phenotype elicited by HFE is not linked to beta(2)M insufficiency.	12464008
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence and penetrance of HFE mutations in 4865 unselected primary care patients.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Two HFE gene mutations, C282Y and H63D, underlie the vast majority of cases of hereditary hemochromatosis. We performed a cross-sectional primary care-based study to determine the allele frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations and the penetrance of each of the affected genotypes defined by their presence. Patients had previously undergone transferrin saturation (TS) testing. A total of 4865 unselected frozen serum samples were analyzed to determine serum ferritin (SF) levels. Genomic DNA isolated from these samples was analyzed for the C282Y and H63D HFE mutations. Homozygotes for each mutation and compound heterozygotes were evaluated to determine clinical penetrance. The allele frequency of C282Y was 0.0507 among Caucasian and 0.0067 among African Americans; that of H63D was 0.1512 and 0.0263, respectively. TS was > or =55% in 83% of individuals with C282Y/C282Y, 14.5% of C282Y/H63D, and 5% of H63D/H63D; SF was > or =300 microG/L in 42, 9, and 5% of these genotypes, respectively. None of the 12 C282Y homozygotes had cardiac dysfunction or hepatic cirrhosis. Only 9/129 (7%) individuals with the genotypes C282Y/H63D or H63D/H63D had a SF > or =300 microG/L; many had explanations other than iron overload that accounted for this increase. Thus, the prevalence of the common HFE mutations is the same in our population as previously described. TS screening would detect most C282Y homozygotes but not the other two genotypes. The penetrance of C282Y/C282Y is significant. The biochemical penetrance of H63D/H63D and C282Y/H63D is modest and the clinical penetrance is low.	12482402
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Juvenile hemochromatosis in the southeastern United States: a report of seven cases in two kinships.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	We report clinical and genetic characteristics of seven juvenile hemochromatosis (JH) patients (six females, one male) in two unrelated kinships from the southeastern U.S. All had severe iron overload. Mean age at diagnosis was 20 +/- 5 years (range 8-23 years). In six patients, the mean age at onset of signs and symptoms attributable to iron overload was 15 +/- 2 years (12-18 years); an 8-year-old girl had no symptoms. Six of the seven patients had hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, two had severe cardiomyopathy, seven had hepatomegaly, two had hepatic cirrhosis, and five had hyperpigmentation. Two of four siblings with JH also had Hashimoto thyroiditis. One patient with severe cardiomyopathy improved with therapeutic phlebotomy, medical therapy for congestive heart failure, and a permanent pacemaker; the other died before phlebotomy was initiated. Estimates of average daily iron absorption before phlebotomy-induced iron depletion were 2.3, 3.1, and 1.7 mg in a male and two females, respectively. Both parents of four siblings with JH were heterozygous at two Ch1q loci (D1S1156, D1S2344); each of the four affected siblings was homozygous at both loci. An unaffected sib was heterozygous at D1S1156. One patient was heterozygous for HFE H63D, five others did not have HFE C282Y or H63D, and one was unavailable for testing. We conclude that JH occurs in the southeastern U.S. It is likely that JH allele(s) in at least one of the present kinships occur(s) on Ch1q, and presumably this represents a mutation(s) of the same gene localized to Ch1q in Italian and Greek JH kindreds. The present cases do not have HFE genotypes typical of hemochromatosis diagnosed in adults. Hashimoto thyroiditis, linked to Ch6p in many kinships, did not segregate with JH alleles on Ch1q in the present kinship.	12482411
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Genetic heterogeneity underlies juvenile hemochromatosis phenotype: analysis of three families of northern Greek origin.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetically heterogeneous disease. Common HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) are related to the majority of hereditary hemochromatosis cases in populations of Northern European ancestry (HFE1). Juvenile hemochromatosis (JH) is a more severe iron overload disorder, usually presenting at the second decade of life. The gene responsible for JH lies on a genetic locus at chromosome 1q. We have performed a genetic linkage study in three families of Northern Greek origin with typical clinical features of JH. In two families results were in accordance with linkage to chromosome 1q. In one family linkage of the disease to the genetic loci at 1q21, 7q22, and 6p22 was excluded. We suggest that more than one gene may underlie the JH phenotype. This genetic type of hemochromatosis may be designated 1q unlinked juvenile hemochromatosis. Family studies are necessary to establish the genetic diagnosis of JH.	12490283
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequencies of C282Y and H63D mutations and transferrin saturation indices in the Korean population.	Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine	2002	3.02	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is an autosomal recessive disorder that damages various organs because of the deposition of excess iron. At the human hemochromatosis (HFE) gene, two mutations of C282Y and H63D have been reported. The frequencies of C282Y and H63D mutations vary among ethnic groups. At present, the most suitable screening test for HHC is the assessment of transferrin saturation (TS). We investigated the distribution of TS and the frequencies of C282Y and H63D mutations among Koreans. TS was measured in 2152 subjects who visited the health promotion center for a checkup. The mean (+/-SD) of TS was 41.7+/-15.4%. We randomly selected 240 subjects and tested them for C282Y and H63D mutations using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). All 240 randomly selected samples were found to be G/G homozygous non-mutated for C282Y. Of the 240 subjects, 18 (7.5%) were found to be C/G heterozygous and 222 subjects were C/C homozygous non-mutated for H63D. In this study, the C282Y mutation was not found in the Korean population, and the H63D mutation showed allele frequency of 3.8%. The mean TS in this study was higher than that of Caucasians.	12241015
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Liver pathology in compound heterozygous patients for hemochromatosis mutations.	Liver	2002	0.5	While hepatic pathology of homozygous carriers of the C282Y mutation of the HFE haemochromatosis gene is well defined, the impact of the C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous carrier state is unknown. To evaluate the range of hepatic pathology in C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous patients. 25 C282Y/H63D compound heterozygous patients with and without known underlying liver disease underwent liver biopsies for evaluation or abnormal liver tests. Eleven cadaveric liver donors with HFE wild type served as controls. Mutations in the HFE gene were detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) separation of digested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplificates. The extent of light microscopic changes of liver architecture were studied on haematoxylin, eosin (H. E.) stains. In addition, the extent and the distribution of iron deposition was graded on Prussian blue-stained sections and hepatic iron was quantified by atom absorption spectroscopy. Serum ferritin concentration and the transferrin saturation index were measured using routine laboratory methods. Patients without underlying liver disease (n = 15): Hepatic inflammation was seen in only 8% but fibrosis was found in 36% of compound heterozygous patients. Eighty six percent of those patients had stainable iron predominantly found in Rappaport's zone 1 and 2, but all had a liver iron-index < 1.9. Transferrin saturation was found elevated in 36% of compound heterozygous patients. Patients with liver fibrosis showed significantly higher ferritin levels than patients without liver fibrosis (1110 ng/mL versus 307 ng/mL, p < 0.05). Patients with underlying disease (n = 10): In compound heterozygous patients, 77% had hepatic inflammation and 88% fibrosis. Stainable iron (44%) was less frequently found than in patients without underlying liver disease. Hepatic iron-index in patients with underlying liver disease was always below 1.17; transferrin saturation was elevated in only 22% of the compound heterozygous patients. Histologic hepatic iron-index was significantly lower in patients with underlying disease (median 0.047) as compared to patients without underlying liver disease (median 0.274, P < 0.05). The underlying liver disease determines the extent of hepatic pathology seen in livers of compound heterozygous patients. However, considerable histologic fibrosis can also be found in compound heterozygous patients without underlying liver disease.	12296962
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron metabolism and the role of HFE gene polymorphisms in Wilson disease.	Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver	2012	4.47	Wilson disease (WD) is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism, which can lead to severe liver failure and to a variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Previous animal studies and case reports suggest that hepatic iron overload and alterations in iron processing are associated with WD. The aim of this study was the assessment of iron metabolism and of the frequency of the most common HFE gene polymorphisms in WD patients. Data from 143 patients with WD were analysed. Clinical presentation, liver function and iron metabolism parameters were recorded. Blood samples of the patients were analysed for HFE gene alterations (H63D; C282Y). Twenty-seven liver biopsies of these patients were studied with regard to iron content and fibrosis score. Contrary to previous reports of HFE gene polymorphisms in WD patients, in our cohort the allele frequencies (C282Y: 2.1%; H63D: 7.3%) were in line with frequencies obtained for general population. Male WD patients with decreased serum ceruloplasmin (Cp), showed increased serum ferritin levels. Hepatic iron content was normal in most cases. Male patients with very low Cp serum concentrations showed slightly elevated median serum ferritin concentrations, probably related to lack of ferroxidase acitivity. However, in consideration of absolute numbers of ferritin concentrations, these changes seem to be of minor clinical relevance.	22098612
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE hemochromatosis and hepatic sarcoid.	The American journal of the medical sciences	2009	0.5	A 57-year-old white woman had serum ferritin 793 ng/mL, HFE C282Y homozygosity, elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, 3+ hepatocyte iron, cirrhosis, hepatic granulomas, and portal hypertension. Her 37-year-old son had ferritin 869 ng/mL, C282Y/wt, elevated ACE levels, 2+ hepatocyte iron, bridging fibrosis, and hepatic granulomas. Her daughters had HFE C282Y/H63D and C282Y/wt, respectively; neither had a hemochromatosis phenotype, sarcoid, or severe liver disease. All 4 subjects had nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis. Sarcoid did not segregate with the human leukocyte antigen-A and -B haplotype shared by the proband, her son, and 1 daughter. Phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion in the proband and her son yielded 1.6 and 1.5 g iron, respectively; their ACE levels remained elevated. We reviewed previous reports of 4 patients with hemochromatosis and sarcoid. We conclude that a combination of sarcoid, steatosis, and excessive hepatocyte iron caused cirrhosis or hepatic fibrosis in the proband and her son.	19440063
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics	2009	7.71	In populations of northern European descent, the p.C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is highly prevalent, and HFE-associated hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common type of inherited iron overload disorder. Inappropriate low secretion of hepcidin, which negatively regulates iron absorption, is postulated to be the mechanism for iron overload in this condition. The characteristic biochemical abnormalities are elevated serum transferrin-iron saturation and serum ferritin. Typical clinical manifestations include cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated serum aminotransferase levels, diabetes mellitus, restrictive cardiomyopathy and arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. Most patients are now diagnosed before the development of these clinical features. Molecular genetic tests are currently available for genotypic diagnosis. In selected individuals, diagnosis might require liver biopsy or quantitative phlebotomy. Iron depletion by phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment and is highly effective in preventing the complications of iron overload if instituted before the development of cirrhosis. Genetic testing is currently not recommended for population screening because of low yield as the majority of the healthy, asymptomatic p.C282Y homozygotes do not develop clinically significant iron overload. HFE gene testing remains an excellent tool for the screening of first-degree relatives of affected probands who are p.C282Y homozygotes.	19444013
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Phlebotomy-mobilized iron as a surrogate for liver iron content in hemochromatosis patients.	Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	2003	0.5	We sought to establish the relationship of quantitative hepatic iron measurements and phlebotomy-mobilized iron in a large sample of HFE C282Y homozygotes with a hemochromatosis phenotype. Thus, we analyzed data from 79 unrelated C282Y homozygotes from treatment centers in Rochester, NY and Birmingham, AL who had undergone liver biopsy with measurement of hepatic iron content and who had achieved iron depletion (serum ferritin <25 ng/l) with quantitative phlebotomy. The sample consisted of 57 men and 22 women; their median age at diagnosis was 47 years (range 23-76 years). Sixty-three of 79 (79.7%) had hepatic iron index (HII; μmol/g dry weight of liver divided by age in years) ≥1.9, a conventional phenotypic definition of hemochromatosis. The mean quantity of phlebotomy-mobilized iron (± 1 sd) was 6.4 g (±4.0 g) in men (range 2.0-18.0 g) and 6.2 g (±5.8) in women (range 0.7-22.5 g). There was a significant positive correlation of liver iron levels with phlebotomy-mobilized iron in this patient sample (Pearson coefficient 0.75; R<PRE>2</PRE>=55.5%). This relationship was also demonstrable when data from males and females were analyzed separately. We calculated a phlebotomy-mobilized iron index (MII: phlebotomy-mobilized iron in mg divided by age in years) using the corresponding regression equations and evaluated its use as a surrogate for HII. Thus, a phlebotomy-mobilized iron of 3.5 g corresponds to liver iron levels of 80 μmol/g dry weight, and a MII of 80 corresponds to HII of 1.9. Forty-six of 79 subjects met all four phenotypic criteria for hemochromatosis (liver iron levels ≥80 μmol/g, HII≥1.9, phlebotomy-mobilized iron ≥3.5 g and MII≥80). Of the 20 subjects with MII<80, 9 had a HII≥1.9. Conversely, 5 of 16 subjects with HII<1.9 had MII≥80 and 8 had phlebotomy-mobilized iron ≥3.5 g. Most patients with a hemochromatosis phenotype and evidence of moderate or severe iron overload (>80%) are homozygous for the common HFE missense mutation C282Y. Thus, clinicians rely increasingly on HFE mutation analysis to diagnose hemochromatosis and on quantitative phlebotomy to estimate the severity of iron overload in many cases. Liver biopsy is now employed in selected patients to visualize fibrosis or cirrhosis and to identify coincidental hepatic disease. We conclude that the use of the MII permits a retrospective estimation of the age-adjusted severity of iron overload that has a diagnostic value similar to that of the HII in hemochromatosis patients with C282Y homozygosity.	14668040
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency and spectrum of hemochromatosis mutations in Tunisia.	The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association	2003	0.5	The occurrence of the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene, responsible for toxic iron overload in the liver (hereditary hemochromatosis), was still unknown in Tunisia. We report the screening of 194 chromosomes from 97 randomly collected cord blood samples. The mutations were analyzed by PCR followed by DNA sequencing. The mild H63D and the severe C282Y mutations were found in 17.5+/-5.34% and 0.5+/-0.97% of the alleles, respectively. The allele frequency of the IVS 2+4 T --> C polymorphism is high (46.4+/-7.01%) in this population. Risk for homozygosity for the severe C282Y mutation is present in the Tunisian population at a low theoretical incidence. However, due to the relatively high rate of consanguinity in the country, liver pathology due to HH is not to be disregarded.	14671616
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutations of the hemochromatosis gene in Italian candidate blood donors with increased transferrin saturation.	The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association	2003	0.5	The aim of this study was to analyze the role of HFE mutations in blood donors with iron parameters suggesting iron overload, taking into account the regional distribution of HFE mutations in Italy. We studied 5880 subjects undergoing evaluation for blood donation eligibility, from different areas of Italy. Abnormal iron parameters were defined as transferrin saturation (TS) >50% or >45% and serum ferritin (SF) >300 or >250 microg/ml in males and females, respectively. Subjects with increased TS and/or SF were re-tested and typed for HFE mutations C282Y and H63D. A total of 548 individuals had increased iron parameters at first testing. In total, 179/548 were available for retesting, and in 109 increased TS and/or SF were confirmed. Increased TS was confirmed in 25 individuals, among whom three were C282Y homozygotes and six were compound heterozygotes for C282Y and H63D. Increased TS was more frequent in northern Italy than in southern regions. In individuals with increased TS and/or SF, the frequency of C282Y and H63D was 0.13 and 0.21 in northern-Italy versus 0.05 and 0.45 in southern Italy (P=0.004 for H63D). Nine out of 10 individuals carrying hemochromatosis-associated genotypes (including compound heterozygosity for C282Y and H63D) originated from northern regions. Among controls, the allelic frequencies of C282Y and H63D were 0.037 and 0.16 in the northern regions and 0.015 and 0.16 in the southern regions. In conclusion, over one-third of individuals with persistently altered TS carried hemochromatosis-associated genotypes, confirming that a diagnostic approach based on TS and genotyping of selected cases may represent a viable screening procedure.	14671617
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Contribution of the H63D mutation in HFE to murine hereditary hemochromatosis.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	2003	9.42	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by iron accumulation in several organs, followed by organ damage and failure. The C282Y mutation in the HFE gene explains 80-90% of all diagnosed cases of HH in populations of northwestern European ancestry. Targeted disruption of the mouse Hfe gene (or introduction of the murine mutation analogous to the C282Y human mutation) produces a murine model of HH. Another mutation in the HFE gene, H63D, is more prevalent than C282Y. However, the physiological consequences of the H63D mutation (as well as C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosity) on iron homeostasis are less well established. To evaluate the phenotypic consequences of the C282Y/H63D and H63D/H63D genotypes, we produced H67D (corresponding to H63D in humans) and C294Y (corresponding to C282Y in humans) knock-in mice. H67D homozygous mice, C294Y homozygous mice, and H67D/C294Y compound heterozygous mice each demonstrated hepatic iron loading. Even on a standard diet, by 10 weeks of age, hepatic iron levels in mice of these three genotypes were significantly higher than those of wild-type littermates. The relative severity of hepatic iron loading was C294Y/C294Y > C294Y/H67D > H67D/H67D. We conclude that the H67D allele, when homozygous or combined with a more consequential mutation like C294Y, leads to hepatic iron loading. These observations indicate that the H67D mutation leads to partial loss of Hfe function and can contribute to murine HH.	14673107
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Absence of hemochromatosis associated Cys282Tyr HFE gene mutation and low frequency of hemochromatosis phenotype in nonalcoholic chronic liver disease patients in India.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2004	3.32	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) is an autosomal recessive disorder causing primary iron overload syndrome and chronic liver disease (CLD). This genetic disease is commonly associated with C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, commonly seen in the Northern European population. Minor reports on HHC are available from Asia, however, so far no genetic study is available from India. We prospectively studied the prevalence of C282Y mutation in CLD patients and healthy subjects in a tertiary care referral center in India. A total of 249 consecutive biopsy proven CLD (HBV = 112, HCV = 72, cryptogenic = 65) patients and 134 age matched healthy controls were included. Cases of secondary iron overload, pregnancy, chronic alcoholism, age < 30 years and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were excluded. A transferrin saturation index (TSI) of >60% was suggestive of a phenotypic presentation of HHC. C282Y mutation was studied by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using genomic DNA. The 387 bp fragment obtained after polymerase chain reaction was digested with 10 units of endonuclease Rsa1. The mutation was detected by creation of an additional restriction site, giving rise to fragments of 247 111 and 29 bp. While the mean TSI was comparable, serum ferritin was significantly higher in CLD patients compared to controls (38 +/- 16%vs 28 +/- 13%; p = not significant (NS), and 125 +/- 18 vs 42 +/- 25 ng/mL; p < 0.001). A TSI of >60% was detected in 24 (9.64%) patients. Only one restriction site was found for endonuclease Rsa1, giving rise to two fragments of 247 and 140 bp, suggesting absence of C282Y mutation in the HFE gene in all patients. Almost 10% of nonalcoholic CLD patients in India have iron overload, but this is independent of C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. Large population based studies are recommended to investigate the prevalence of this rare disorder in India.	14675248
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Iron as comorbid factor in chronic hepatitis C].	Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)	2003	0.5	Hepatitis C virus infection is often associated with an elevation of iron parameters. Free liver iron causes liver damage and liver fibrosis preferentially through induction of reactive oxygen species. With an allele frequency of 5-10% for the C282Y mutation and 6-30% for the H63D mutation, there is a frequent coincidence of hemochromatosis (HFE) mutations and chronic hepatitis C. There is increasing evidence that HFE homozygosity and even HFE heterozygosity are associated with an increased liver iron concentration and liver fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis C. In addition, present data suggest an impact of iron on the outcome of interferon therapy. Thus, HFE mutations and liver iron stores seem to be important comorbid factors in chronic hepatitis C. Screening for iron parameters and HFE mutations should be considered in patients with hepatitis C.	14685669
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Two Dutch families with hereditary hyperferritinaemia-cataract syndrome and heterozygosity for an HFE-related haemochromatosis gene mutation.	The Netherlands journal of medicine	2003	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, leading to progressive iron overload, which is very common among the Caucasian population. In the vast majority of the cases, the hereditary iron overload is caused by mutations in the HFE gene. Most prominently this is the homozygous Cys282Tyr mutation. We report two Dutch families in which both propositi were found to be heterozygous for Cys282Tyr in the work-up of hyperferritinaemia. Frequent phlebotomies had no effect on the ferritin level, but led to microcytic anaemia. Finally, the family history with bilateral cataracts was the clue for the correct diagnosis. Hereditary hyperferritinaemia-cataract syndrome (HHCS) is an autosomal dominant disease characterised by elevated serum ferritin levels and bilateral cataracts in the absence of iron overload. Several point mutations and deletions within the iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5' noncoding region of the L-ferritin gene have been found in HHCS families. In the first Dutch family a G to C transition at position 32 was found and a G to A mutation at the same location was found in the second Dutch family. In individuals with an isolated hyperferritinaemia (normal transferrin saturation), the presence of early onset (familial) cataract should raise the possibility of HHCS, even when Cys282Tyr heterozygosity is found.	14692443
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Diet and genetic factors associated with iron status in middle-aged women.	The American journal of clinical nutrition	2005	0.5	Gene mutations associated with iron overload have been identified. How food and nutrient intakes affect iron status in persons who may be at risk of iron overload because their genetic status is unknown. The objective was to determine the relation between food and nutrient intakes, HFE genotype, and iron status. Foods and nutrients associated with iron stores, with adjustment for gene mutations associated with hemochromatosis, were explored. A prospective cohort of women aged 35-69 y (the UK Women's Cohort Study) provided information on diet through a questionnaire and food diary; 6779 women in the cohort provided cheek cell samples, blood samples, or both, which were genotyped for C282Y and H63D mutations, and 2489 women also had their iron status assessed. Relations between serum ferritin and iron intake were investigated by using multiple linear regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. The strongest dietary association with serum ferritin concentration was a positive association with heme iron and not with nonheme or total iron. Weaker positive associations were seen with red and white meat, and negative associations were seen with total energy and white and brown whole-meal bread, independent of genotype and other potential confounders. The effect of genotype on ferritin concentrations primarily occurred after menopause, at which time a strong interaction between genotype and heme iron intake was observed. Other factors associated with serum ferritin concentrations were age, body mass index, blood donation, menopausal status, and HFE genotype. Postmenopausal women eating a diet rich in heme iron and who were C282Y homozygotes had the highest serum ferritin concentrations.	16210711
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations in Russian healthy women and patients with estrogen-dependent cancers.	Biochimica et biophysica acta	2006	0.5	Possible association between the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene and estrogen-dependent cancer risk was assessed. Genotyping was performed using PCR amplification followed by digestion of products with specific restrictases. In a population of 260 healthy women (permanent residents of the southwest European Russia), mutant allele frequencies at the C282Y and H63D sites were evaluated as 3.3 and 16.3%, respectively. In patients with breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer, C282Y frequencies were also low (1.0, 1.3, and 3.8%, respectively), and no cancer risk associated with the C282Y mutation was found. Odds ratios for breast cancer risk associated with the H63D mutation increased significantly with age: 0.5 in women below 48 years old, 1.0 in a range of 48-57 years, and 4.4 in older women (P(trend)=0.002). The latter value was statistically significant (95% CI, 1.4-14.1), indicating that women bearing the H63D mutation may be at an increased breast cancer risk at an age above 57 years. Preliminary results obtained in patients with two other estrogen-dependent malignancies revealed the same tendency to OR increase with age in ovarian cancer patients (P(trend)=0.008), but no age-related OR differences in endometrial cancer patients.	16216474
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotype modifies the influence of heme iron intake on iron status.	Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)	2005	0.5	Public health policy to prevent iron deficiency through food fortification or other measures may be disadvantageous to people with hereditary hemochromatosis. From a cohort of U.K. women, 2531 women were typed for C282Y and H63D mutations in the hemochromatosis gene. These women completed food frequency questionnaires and provided blood for iron status. C282Y homozygotes (n=31) had serum ferritin concentrations 2.4 times higher (95% confidence interval=1.9-3.1) than wild types (n=1774), but heterozygotes (n=726) were not different from wild types. H63D genotype had no effect on its own. The effect of heme iron intake (from meat, fish, and poultry) was 2.0 times greater (1.2-3.2) on C282Y homozygotes than other groups. Nonheme iron had little effect. There may be scope for dietary intervention in women homozygous for the C282Y mutation. C282Y heterozygotes and H63D homozygotes and heterozygotes have similar serum ferritin concentrations to wild type and need not reduce their meat intake other than as part of a normal healthy diet.	16222171
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Initial screening transferrin saturation values, serum ferritin concentrations, and HFE genotypes in whites and blacks in the Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening Study.	Genetic testing	2005	0.5	We compared initial screening data of 44,082 white and 27,124 black Hemochromatosis and Iron Overload Screening (HEIRS) Study participants. Each underwent serum transferrin saturation (TfSat) and ferritin (SF) measurements without regard to fasting, and HFE C282Y and H63D genotyping. Elevated measurements were defined as: TfSat more than 50% (men), more than 45% (women); and SF more than 300 ng/ml (men), more than 200 ng/ml (women). Mean TfSat and percentages of participants with elevated TfSat were significantly greater in whites than in blacks. Mean SF and percentages of participants with elevated SF were significantly greater in blacks than in whites. TfSat and SF varied by gender and age in whites and blacks. Prevalences of genotypes that included either C282Y or H63D were significantly greater in whites than in blacks. The prevalence of elevated TfSat and SF plus genotypes C282Y/C282Y, C282Y/H63D, or H63D/H63D was 0.006 in whites and 0.0003 in blacks. Among whites with HFE C282Y homozygosity, 76.8% of men and 46.9% of women had elevated TfSat and SF values. Three black participants had HFE C282Y homozygosity; one had elevated TfSat and SF values. Possible explanations for differences in TfSat and SF in whites and blacks and pertinence to the detection of hemochromatosis, iron overload, and other disorders with similar phenotypes are discussed.	16225403
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis: genetic testing and clinical practice.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2005	7.68	"""The availability of a facile treatment for hemochromatosis renders early diagnosis of iron overload syndromes mandatory, and in many instances genetic testing allows identification of individuals at risk of developing clinical disease before pathologic iron storage occurs. Numerous proteins implicated in iron homeostasis have recently come to light, and defects in the cognate genes are associated with iron storage. Although most adult patients with hereditary iron overload are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, an increasing number with hereditary iron storage have an HFE genotype not characteristic of the disease. Heterozygosity for mutations in the gene encoding ferroportin 1 (FPN1) is probably the second most common genetic cause of hereditary iron storage in adults; here the primarily affected cell is the macrophage. Rare defects, including mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) gene, have also been identified in pedigrees affected with """"non-HFE hemochromatosis."""" Homozygous mutations in the newly identified genes encoding hemojuvelin (HFE2) and hepcidin (HAMP) cause juvenile hemochromatosis. At the same time, heterozygosity for mutations in these genes can modify the clinical expression of iron storage in patients predisposed to iron storage in adult life. Hemochromatosis might thus be considered as a polygenic disease with strong environmental influences on its clinical expression. As our mechanistic understanding of iron pathophysiology improves, our desire to integrate clinical decision making with the results of laboratory tests and molecular analysis of human genes poses increasing challenges."""	16234038
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Phenotype variation in C282Y homozygotes for the hemochromatosis gene.	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association	2005	7.68	Typical hemochromatosis patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. However, approximately 50% of women and 20% of men do not have an increase in serum ferritin level. This study assessed factors, genetic and otherwise, that may modify biochemical expression in C282Y homozygotes. Hemochromatosis families that each had at least 2 untreated C282Y homozygotes were included. Nonexpressors were defined as having a ferritin level less than 300 microg/L for a male and a ferritin level less than 200 microg/L for a female. A multivariate linear stepwise regression analysis was performed to assess the contribution of sex, age, and the presence of a nonexpressor in the family on serum ferritin level. Heritability calculations were performed using variance component analysis. Fifty-three pedigrees consisting of 148 C282Y homozygotes (92 males, 56 females) were identified. Twenty-nine homozygotes were nonexpressors (19.6%), of which 11 of 29 were male (37.9%) (P=.0054). Based on multivariate analysis, highly significant associations with increased ferritin levels in C282Y homozygotes were male sex (P=.00005), increasing age (P=.009), and absence of a nonexpressor in the family (P=.01). Variance component modeling using age, sex, and C282Y genotype as covariates in 39 pedigrees (n=296) showed a residual heritability for serum ferritin of .35+/-.10 (P<.001). These findings suggest that male sex is the major clinical factor associated with an increased serum ferritin level in hemochromatosis. In addition, these results support the hypothesis that other genes contribute to the variance in serum ferritin concentration among C282Y homozygotes.	16234052
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Measurement of iron and zinc isotopes in human whole blood: preliminary application to the study of HFE genotypes.	Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS)	2005	2.55	Multi-collector inductively coupled plasma--sector field mass spectrometry was applied to the measurement of Fe and Zn isotopes in human whole blood samples. For the Fe present in the blood of healthy adults, enrichment of the lighter isotopes relative to a standard material was observed, in agreement with earlier studies. The level of fractionation was found to be lower in hemochromatosis patients exhibiting homozygous (C282Y/C282Y) mutation of the HFE gene. On the one hand, this reinforces the hypothesis that Fe fractionation in blood decreases with enhanced dietary absorption. On the other hand, this contradicts predictions made on the basis of determinations of Fe fractionation in blood samples collected from subjects characterized by milder HFE mutations. In healthy subjects, the Zn in blood is depleted in lighter isotopes, consistent with the limited number of prior observations. As for Fe, the Zn isotopic composition exhibited a tendency toward lower levels of fractionation in the blood of subjects with hereditary hemochromatosis with homozygous mutation (C282Y/C282Y) of the HFE gene. The results therefore suggest that both Fe and Zn isotopic signatures in whole blood, at least to some extent, reflect polymorphisms in the HFE gene.	16240673
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Cardiac phosphorus-31 two-dimensional chemical shift imaging in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis.	Magnetic resonance imaging	2004	1.98	Hemochromatosis is a hereditary iron overload syndrome characterized by increased iron storage, followed by liver cirrhosis and is often associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy. The purpose of this study was to detect alterations of cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolism in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis (HHC) prior to the development of structural heart diseases. Therefore cardiac phosphorus-31 two-dimensional chemical shift imaging ((31)P 2D CSI) was employed. Twenty-four male patients (mean age 47.2 +/- 12 years) homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the hemochromatosis associated HFE gene and twenty-four male healthy volunteers (mean age 47 +/- 11 years) as age-matched controls were included in this study. Using a 1.5-Tesla whole-body magnetic resonance scanner, electrocardiograph-triggered transversal 31P 2D CSI was performed. Left ventricle mean phosphocreatine (PCr) to beta-adenosine triphosphate (beta-ATP) ratios of patients with HHC (1.60 +/- 0.41) were significantly decreased in comparison to healthy volunteers (1.93 +/- 0.36; p = 0.004). Furthermore, we detected moderate, negative correlations between left ventricular PCr to beta-ATP ratios and transferrin saturation, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein as well as triglyceride. This study shows that 31P 2D CSI permits the detection of alterations of cardiac high-energy phosphate metabolism in patients with HHC, but without any evidence for heart disease. The decreased PCr to beta-ATP ratios in HHC might be caused by mitochondrial impairment due to cardiac iron overload.	15120171
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Association between hemochromatosis genotype and lead exposure among elderly men: the normative aging study.	Environmental health perspectives	2004	8.44	Because body iron burden is inversely associated with lead absorption, genes associated with hemochromatosis may modify body lead burden. Our objective was to determine whether the C282Y and/or H63D hemochromatosis gene (HFE) is associated with body lead burden. Patella and tibia lead levels were measured by K X-ray fluorescence in subjects from the Normative Aging Study. DNA samples were genotyped for C282Y and H63D using polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR/RFLP). A series of multivariate linear regression models were constructed with bone or blood lead as dependent variables; age, smoking, and education as independent variables; and C282Y or H63D as independent risk factors and/or effect modifiers. Of 730 subjects, 94 (13%) carried the C282Y variant and 183 (25%) carried the H63D variant. In the crude analysis, mean tibia, patella, and blood lead levels were consistently lower in carriers of either HFE variant compared with levels in subjects with wild-type genotypes. In multivariate analyses that adjusted for age, smoking, and education, having an HFE variant allele was an independent predictor of significantly lower patella lead levels (p < 0.05). These data suggest that HFE variants have altered kinetics of lead accumulation after exposure. Among elderly men, subjects with HFE variants had lower patella lead levels. These effects may be mediated by alterations in lead toxicokinetics via iron metabolic pathways regulated by the HFE gene product and body iron stores.	15121519
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Multigenic control of hepatic iron loading in a murine model of hemochromatosis.	Gastroenterology	2004	18.19	Hereditary hemochromatosis is a common disorder of iron homeostasis characterized by increased dietary iron absorption and progressive iron accumulation, mainly in the liver. Most patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. However, not all individuals carrying the hemochromatosis-predisposing genotype in the general population become iron loaded. Genetic modifiers have been shown to influence disease penetrance, but their number and chromosomal locations remain unknown, and their identification is hampered by complex interactions with environmental factors. To circumvent these difficulties, we used 2 strains of mice made deficient for the Hfe gene that strongly differ in their propensity to develop hepatic iron loading. To localize the loci controlling hepatic iron loading in this murine model of hemochromatosis, we produced 1028 mice by an F2 intercross between the C57BL/6 and DBA/2 Hfe-deficient strains. We selected the 276 mice that contributed the most to the total linkage information for genotyping with 145 microsatellite markers. We mapped 4 modifier loci on chromosomes 7, 8, 11, and 12, with logarithm of odds scores of 14.47, 12.96, 6.04, and 6.72, respectively, in regions containing several genes recently shown to exert important roles in the regulation of iron metabolism. Our data provide a clear demonstration of the polygenic pattern of hepatic iron loading inheritance in Hfe-deficient mice. Examination of candidate genes residing at the loci identified in this study and genetic analysis of the syntenic chromosomal regions in humans may provide important insight into the heterogeneous disease presentation observed among HFE C282Y homozygotes.	15131800
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE mutations are not strongly associated with sporadic ALS.	Neurology	2004	8.17	The presence of oxidative damage and increased iron deposition in CNS tissues of ALS patients prompted the authors to examine the prevalence of two common HFE gene mutations linked to iron accumulation and consequent oxidative stress. The prevalence of the C282Y and H63D mutations was nearly identical in 51 ALS patients and 47 normal control subjects. The presence of either mutation did not significantly affect the age at onset or rate of progression in ALS.	15136693
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The HFE gene heterozygosis H63D: a cofactor for liver damage in patients with steatohepatitis? Epidemiological and clinical considerations.	Internal medicine journal	2008	1.53	The altered status of iron metabolism is reported in hereditary haemochromatosis and in non-alcoholic liver fatty disease. We investigated the relation between the H63D HFE mutation gene and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We studied as outpatients, 272 Italian persons with NASH and compared them with 430 healthy subjects. Genetic screening for haemochromatosis, haematochemical tests, liver ultrasound examination and liver biopsies were carried out. The prevalence of heterozygosity for the H63D mutation in NASH patients was not significantly greater than controls. In assessing the C282Y HFE gene mutation alone, the percentage of heterozygosis for C282Y was not different in subjects with NASH compared with controls. As regards a mutation C282Y/H63D there was no significant difference between the two groups. The mean fibrosis score was not significantly different between subjects of group A, with and without HFE mutations (1 +/- 8 and 1 +/- 9, respectively); we did not find a significant correlation between hepatic iron concentration and histological score between subjects. We have not found a significantly increased prevalence of the mutation H63D in the HFE gene in our patients with NASH. In these patients there was no more severe hepatic histological score when compared with NASH subjects without HFE mutations.	17916170
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The HLA-A1-B8 haplotype hitchhiking with the hemochromatosis mutation: does it affect the phenotype?	European journal of haematology	2007	2.54	Hemochromatosis is a recessively inherited disorder caused by a point mutation, C282Y of the HFE gene on chromosome 6p21.3 near the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus. It is unknown why some homozygotes develop a severe iron loading, while others do not. A recent study suggested that the A1-B8 haplotype may be associated with higher iron storage. We studied HLA haplotypes of 85 probands, 31 females and 54 males, and their family members from a rural population where A1-B8 was common. We tested the hypothesis of a modifying effect of the A1-B8 haplotype. Most homozygotes had a mild phenotypic expression, and were often detected accidentally because of a laboratory routine including transferrin saturation. A disease-related morbidity [serum alanine aminotransferase (S-ALT) > 43 U] was present in 40%. Three had porphyria cutanea tarda. Two brothers with A1-B8 died of bronze diabetes, probably caused by co-inheritance of congenital spherocytosis. In females there were no significant differences in phenotypic expression between groups with regard to the presence or absence of A1-B8. Two females, <50 yr of age, with this haplotype had iron deficiency. Males with two copies of A1-B8 had significantly lower serum ferritin (P = 0.02) values than those without. Those with one A1-B8 haplotype were not different from those without. In men without A1-B8, those carrying HLA-A3 were not phenotypically different from those without this ancestral haplotype. The A1-B8 haplotype hitchhiking with the C282Y mutation was not associated with a more efficient iron absorption. On the contrary, males with double copies of this haplotype expressed a milder phenotype, possibly an effect of local (environmental and/or genetic) factors.	17924859

Annals of hematology	2012	3.02	HFE-hemochromatosis is a common autosomal recessive disease caused by HFE gene mutations and characterized as iron overload and failure of different organs. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of C282Y (c.845 G>A), H63D (c.187 C>G), and S65C (c.193A>T) alleles of HFE gene in the Lithuanian population. One thousand and eleven healthy blood donors of Lithuanian nationality were examined in four different ethnic Lithuanian regions to determine HFE gene alleles and genotype frequencies. The samples of DNA were analyzed for the presence of restriction fragment length polymorphism and validated by DNA sequencing. Among 1,011 blood donors tested, the frequency of C282Y, H63D, and S65C alleles were 2.6%, 15.9%, and 1.9%, respectively. One third of the tested subjects (n = 336) had at least one of the C282Y or H63D HFE gene mutations. The screening of Lithuanian blood donors has detected 13 (1.3%) subjects with a genotype C282Y/C282Y or C282Y/H63D responsible for the development of HFE-hemochromatosis. The prevalence of C282Y mutation was significantly higher among the inhabitants of Zemaitija (Somogitia) at the Baltic Sea area (5.9%) in comparison to the regions of continental part of Lithuania (2.4% in Dzukija, 2.3% in Aukstaitija, and 2% in Suvalkija, p < 0.05). These data support the hypothesis that the p.C282Y mutation originated from Scandinavia and spread with the Vikings along the Baltic Sea coast. The first epidemiological investigation of HFE gene mutations in ethnic Lithuanians showed that the frequencies of H63D, C282Y, and S65C of HFE gene alleles are similar to the other North-Eastern Europeans, especially in the Baltic region (Estonia, Latvia), Poland, and part of Russia (Moscow region).	21947086
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Low frequency of HFE gene mutations in Croatian patients suspected of having hereditary hemochromatosis.	Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research	2011	1.4	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder in populations of European descent. It is characterized by a variable prevalence of mutations in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) in different countries and a complex relationship between the HFE genotype and the HH phenotype. Genetic analysis has not been conducted in Croatian patients with iron overload. The aim of this study was to determine whether HFE mutations, C282Y, H63D, and S65C were correlated with clinical and biochemical parameters in Croatian patients with suspected HH. Clinical examination, biochemical analysis, and genotyping were performed in 175 patients suspected of having HH. The control group consisted of 350 healthy blood donors. Among the patients, 20% had genotypes related to HH--7.4% were homozygous for C282Y, 6.3% were compound heterozygous for C282Y and H63D, 5.7% were homozygous for H63D, and 0.6% was compound heterozygous for C282Y and S65C. The allelic frequencies were 14.6% for C282Y mutation, 23.7% for H63D mutation, and 1.4% for S65C mutation. A comparison of the clinical and laboratory profiles of patients revealed that C282Y homozygotes had higher frequencies of all clinical symptoms and higher levels of biochemical parameters than others. The C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes and H63D homozygotes were found to be clinically important, despite the fact that they were associated with less severe disease. Our results show that HFE mutations are responsible for only about 20% of Croatian patients with suspected HH. Screening with biochemical methods and HFE genotyping may be not sufficient for diagnoses in the Croatian population.	21959608
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The relationship between selected VDR, HFE and ALAD gene polymorphisms and several basic toxicological parameters among persons occupationally exposed to lead.	Toxicology	2015	3.82	The aim of this study was to find a relationship between polymorphisms of ALAD rs1805313, rs222808, rs1139488, VDR FokI and HFE C282Y and H63D and basic toxicological parameters (lead and ZnPP blood concentration) in people occupationally exposed to lead. We collected data of 101 workers (age 25-63 years) directly exposed to lead. The toxicological lab tests included blood lead, cadmium and ZnPP concentration measurement and arsenic urine concentration measurement. Workers were genotyped for ALAD (rs1805313, rs222808, rs1139488), HFE (C282Y, H63D) and VDR (FokI). Individuals with the lead exposure and coexisting F allel in the locus Fok-I of VDR gene are suspected of higher zinc protoporphyrins concentrations. Workers exposed to the lead with the Y allel in the locus C282Y of the HFE gene are predisposed to lower ZnPP levels and individuals with coexisting H allel in the locus H63D HFE gene are predisposed to lower Pb-B levels. The T allel in the locus rs1805313 of the ALAD gene determines lower Pb-B and ZnPP levels in lead-exposed individuals. The heterozigosity of the locus rs2228083 of the ALAD gene has a strong predilection to higher Pb-B levels. The carriage of the C allel in the locus rs1139488 of the ALAD gene might determine higher Pb-B levels and the heterozigosity of the locus rs1139488 of the ALAD gene might result in higher ZnPP levels. The study revealed relationship between VDR, HFE and ALAD genes polymorphism and basic toxicological parameters in occupationally exposed workers.	25963508
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis type 1 phenotype modifiers in Italian patients. The controversial role of variants in HAMP, BMP2, FTL and SLC40A1 genes.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases	2015	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a heterogeneous disorder of iron metabolism. The most common form of the disease is Classic or type 1 HH, mainly caused by a biallelic missense p.Cys282Tyr (c.845G>A) mutation in the HFE gene. However, the penetrance of p.Cys282Tyr/p.Cys282Tyr genotype is incomplete in terms of both biochemical and clinical expressivity. Lack of penetrance is thought to be caused by several genetic and environmental factors. Recently, a lot of evidences on HH genetic modifiers were produced, often without conclusive results. We investigated 6 polymorphisms (rs10421768 in HAMP gene, rs235756 in BMP2 gene, rs2230267 in FTL gene, rs1439816 in SLC40A1 gene, rs41295942 in TFR2 gene and rs2111833 in TMPRSS6 gene) with uncertain function in order to further evaluate their role in an independent cohort of 109 HH type 1 patients. Our results make it likely the role of rs10421768, rs235756, rs2230267 and rs1439816 polymorphisms, respectively in HAMP, BMP2, FTL and SLC40A1 genes in HH expressivity. In addition, previous and our findings support a hypothetical multifactorial model of HH, characterized by a principal gene (HFE in HH type 1) and minor genetic and environmental factors that still have to be fully elucidated.	25976471
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Epidemiology and diagnostic testing for hemochromatosis and iron overload.	International journal of laboratory hematology	2015	2.4	Hemochromatosis is the most common genetic disease in northern European populations. Body iron stores progressively increase in most patients, which can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma, heart failure, arthritis, and pigmentation. Simple blood tests such as the serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are useful to suggest the diagnosis which can be confirmed in most cases with a simple genetic test for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. However, these blood tests are often misinterpreted and there are rare patients with iron overload without HFE mutations. A diagnostic approach is presented based on a large referral practice and a population-based study (HEIRS) which screened for iron overload in 101,168 participants.	25976957
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Ancestral association between HLA and HFE H63D and C282Y gene mutations from northwest Colombia.	Genetics and molecular biology	2015	1.34	"""A significant association between HFE gene mutations and the HLA-A*03-B*07 and HLA-A*29-B*44 haplotypes has been reported in the Spanish population. It has been proposed that these mutations are probably connected with Celtic and North African ancestry, respectively. We aimed to find the possible ancestral association between HLA alleles and haplotypes associated with the HFE gene (C282Y and H63D) mutations in 214 subjects from Antioquia, Colombia. These were 18 individuals with presumed hereditary hemochromatosis (""""HH"""") and 196 controls. The HLA-B*07 allele was in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with C282Y, while HLA-A*23, A*29, HLA-B*44, and B*49 were in LD with H63D. Altogether, our results show that, although the H63D mutation is more common in the Antioquia population, it is not associated with any particular HLA haplotype, whereas the C282Y mutation is associated with HLA-A*03-B*07, this supporting a northern Spaniard ancestry."""	25983618
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Phenotypic expression of HFE mutations: a French study of 1110 unrelated iron-overloaded patients and relatives.	Gastroenterology	1999	18.19	Two mutations have been described in the HFE gene: C282Y and H63D. The aim of this study was to determine the phenotype of the different HFE genotypes. Clinical symptoms and iron data were examined according to HFE genotypes in 531 unrelated patients with unexplained liver iron overload and 579 relatives of hemochromatotic patients. Non-C282Y +/+ patients did not markedly differ in terms of iron overload or clinical expression according to genotype, except for compound heterozygotes, who had slightly increased transferrin saturation. This contrasted with the strikingly increased expression in C282Y homozygotes. Similar phenotype/genotype correlations were observed in relatives based on serum iron test results. Family transmission of iron overload linked to HFE was exceptional in non-C282Y +/+ siblings and frequent in C282Y homozygotes. Iron overload in patients with the non-C282Y +/+ genotype is mild to moderate, strikingly lower than in C282Y homozygotes, and is not influenced by HFE genotype, except, to a small extent, for compound heterozygotes. The role of H63D mutation therefore seems to be marginal.	9922318
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis and Vibrio vulnificus wound infections.	Journal of clinical gastroenterology	2009	3.16	There are several reports of persons with hemochromatosis and Vibrio vulnificus primary septicemia, but few accounts of persons with hemochromatosis and V. vulnificus wound infection. A 58-year-old white man developed infection of a forearm injury exposed to seawater in the Gulf of Mexico near the Alabama coast. At age 66, he was diagnosed to have hemochromatosis. Transferrin saturation was 89% and serum ferritin was 4761 pmol/L. HFE genotype was C282Y/C282Y. Serum levels of hepatic enzymes, glucose, IgG, IgA, and IgM, and blood levels of T, B, and natural killer cells were normal. We identified previous reports of only 2 similar cases: a woman from Alabama and a man from northern Australia. Mean age of the 3 subjects was 51 years at diagnosis of infection. Each had elevated serum iron measures or iron overload complications; both men were diagnosed to have hemochromatosis after they developed infection. Each of the 3 had recent exposure of a wound on an extremity to seawater, rapid development of a necrotizing soft tissue infection that required debridement and skin grafting, and positive wound or blood cultures. Each subject survived the infection. V. vulnificus wound infection occurs in some persons with hemochromatosis, but the risk of infection may be small. All patients with V. vulnificus infections should be evaluated for hemochromatosis, iron overload, and liver disorders.	19349902
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Differences in hepatic phenotype between hemochromatosis patients with HFE C282Y homozygosity and other HFE genotypes.	Journal of clinical gastroenterology	2009	3.16	There are limited data comparing hepatic phenotype among hemochromatosis patients with different HFE genotypes. The goal of this study was to compare hepatic histopathologic features and hepatic iron concentration (HIC) among patients with phenotypic hemochromatosis and different HFE genotypes. We studied 182 US patients with phenotypic hemochromatosis. Degree of hepatic fibrosis, pattern of iron deposition, presence of steatosis or necroinflammation, and HIC were compared among different HFE genotypes. C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes and patients with HFE genotypes other than C282Y/C282Y were more likely to have stainable Kupffer cell iron (31.1% vs. 9.5%; P=0.02), portal or lobular inflammation (28.9% vs. 15.6%; P=0.03), and steatosis (33.3% vs. 10.2%; P<0.01) on liver biopsy than C282Y homozygotes. Mean log10 HIC (P<0.05) and log10 ferritin (P<0.05) were higher among C282Y homozygotes than in patients with other HFE genotypes. In a logistic regression analysis using age, sex, HFE genotype, log10 ferritin, and log10 HIC as independent variables, log10 serum ferritin (P=0.0008), male sex (P=0.0086), and log10 HIC (P=0.047), but not HFE genotype (P=0.0554) were independently associated with presence or absence of advanced hepatic fibrosis. C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes and other non-C282Y homozygotes which express the hepatic hemochromatosis phenotype frequently have evidence of steatosis or chronic hepatitis and lower body iron stores than C282Y homozygotes. These data suggest that presence of concomitant liver disease may explain expression of the hemochromatosis phenotype among non-C282Y homozygotes. Increased age, HIC, and ferritin are associated with advanced hepatic fibrosis, regardless of HFE genotype.	19359997
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis: as a conformational disorder.	The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology	2009	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) refers to a unique clinicopathologic subset of iron overload syndromes that includes the disorder related to C282Y homozygous mutation of the hemochromatosis protein (HFE), the most common form of hereditary hemochromatosis. Recent reports have highlighted analogies with the class of disorders, known as the conformational diseases whereby HFE C282Y mutant protein forms aggregates and is subsequently retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In conformational disorders, accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER can activate a complex cascade linked to the regulation of diverse physiologic processes, disease onset and progression. To-date, reviews on HFE C282Y HH have largely dealt with the end-stage consequence of this disorder (iron overload). However, our review focuses on upstream molecular events resulting from the mislocalization of the aggregation-prone HFE C282Y protein leading to potential advances in treatment and diagnosis.	19375516
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Liver iron accumulation in patients with chronic active hepatitis C: prevalence and role of hemochromatosis gene mutations and relationship with hepatic histological lesions.	Journal of hepatology	1999	10.59	Liver iron accumulation has been described in patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH) C, and could play a role in the course of liver disease and negatively influence the response to interferon. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and severity of liver iron accumulation in CAH C, to assess its relationship with the HFE C282Y and H63D mutations, and to study its interactions with hepatic histological lesions. Two hundred and nine patients (131 men, 78 women, mean age 44.3+/-12.0 years) with CAH C, including 19 patients with cirrhosis (9.1%) were studied. A semiquantitative grading system from 0 to 3 was used for histological assessment of liver iron accumulation on Perls' staining. The HFE C282Y and H63D mutations were screened for by restriction enzyme analysis performed on PCR-amplified products. Histological scores of activity and fibrosis were determined according to a previously validated METAVIR score system. Liver iron accumulation was found in 88/209 patients (42.1%), and was generally mild. The C282Y and H63D allele frequencies were in 23 (11.0%), and 50 (23.9%), respectively. No association was found between the presence of liver iron accumulation and the detection of the C282Y and H63D mutations. A significant relationship was found between the severity of histological activity and liver iron accumulation of macrophagic or mixed (i.e. both macrophagic and hepatocytic) type (p = 0.04). Although the number of cirrhotic patients was small, cirrhosis was more frequently observed in patients with than without liver iron accumulation (17.2% vs. 3.3%, p = 0.004). Overall, these data suggest that the liver iron accumulation in patients with CAH C is significantly associated with histological activity and cirrhosis, whereas the two missense hemochromatosis gene mutations are not major determinants.	10604569
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Iron in the era of molecular biology].	Pathologie-biologie	1999	0.5	Identification of the HFE gene and its C282Y and H63D mutations has improved the classification of iron overload disorders. Inherited hemochromatosis is due mainly, or perhaps only, to C282Y homozygosity, whereas nonhemochromatosis forms of iron overload are due to other HFE mutations and are usually responsible for mild overload precipitated by another factor such as cirrhosis or insulin-resistance. In practice, the diagnosis of inherited hemochromatosis rests on demonstration of homozygosity for the C282Y mutation; in this setting, the role of liver biopsy is to evaluate the prognosis by looking for fibrosis. In patients who are not homozygous for the C282Y mutation but have severe iron overload, causes other than hemochromatosis should be looked for before the extremely remote possibility of nonC282Y-related hemochromatosis is considered; here, liver biopsy remains of considerable diagnostic usefulness.	10609274
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	[Demonstration of HFE polymorphism in German patients with hereditary hemochromatosis].	Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946)	1999	0.5	Hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) is the most common genetically determined disease of the white population which by iron overload causes multiorgan functional impairment. Recently the gene for HH (HFE gene) has been located on chromosome 6. The development of HH is thought to be caused by two point mutations that lead to an amino acid exchange of tyrosine for cysteine on codon 282 (Cys282Tyr) and of histidine by aspargic acid on codon 63 (His63Asp). 75 patients with phenotypically confirmed HH were examined genetically. The analysis of the HFE-gene mutation was done on genomic DNA by restriction digestion with the restriction enzymes Rsal and Mbol. Homozygosity for the Cys282Tyr mutation was found in 66 (88%) of the patients, while two were heterozygous. Of seven patients with wild-type sequence of the amino acid position 282, three (43%) had a His63Asp exchange. Overall only four patients had neither of the two mutations. Because of different geographical distributions, a knowledge of the mutation rate is important for patients with HH. to assess the diagnostic value of the gene test. For the first time gene analysis makes it possible to diagnose HH before clinically significant iron overload occurs. It may further improve prognosis of the disease by early application of therapeutic blood-letting.	10615325
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Evidence from a Ghanaian population of known African descent to support the proposition that hemochromatosis is a Caucasian disorder.	Genetic testing	1999	0.5	Mutations in the HFE gene on chromosome 6 are believed to cause the iron overload disorder hemochromatosis, the most common single gene disorder in northern Europeans. Two mutations have been described previously: C282Y, with an allele frequency of between 3% and 10% in the caucasian population, and H63D, which has an allele frequency of 16%. Published data shows that C282Y appears to be causative in the homozygous state, while the frequency of H63D/C282Y compound heterozygotes is much greater than expected in patient groups. There also appears to be a slightly elevated risk for H63D homozygotes. Hemochromatosis has been thought to be primarily a caucasian disorder. We have studied 97 healthy, black Ghanaian subjects, whose parents and grandparents were also African, to find the frequency of the two mutations. C282Y was absent, while H63D occurred in 2 individuals. These differences are significant at the 0.05 and 0.001 levels, respectively. The prevalence of H63D homozygotes in this population at 1 in 10,000 is clearly of no use in studying the effect of this genotype on phenotype. However, this study suggests an absence of the C282Y mutation in African populations, and the possibility that other populations might provide different genotypes and hence an analysis of H63D risk. A possible heterozygote advantage for the mutation is discussed.	10627947
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of three hereditary hemochromatosis mutant alleles in the Michigan Caucasian population.	Community genetics	2005	0.5	To investigate the prevalence in the Michigan non-Hispanic Caucasian population of the C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations in the HFE gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were performed on 3,532 blood samples from newborn screening cards provided by the state of Michigan. More than 30% of Michigan Caucasians carry one HFE mutation, while 6% have two mutations. The allele frequency of the C282Y mutation is 5.7%, significantly higher than expected (p < 0.05), while the frequency of the H63D mutation is 14%, significantly lower than expected (p < 0.01). This is the first publication to examine HFE allele frequencies in an unbiased sample of the Caucasian population. Results indicate that the C282Y mutation may be more common in the non-Hispanic Caucasian population than previously reported, and medical problems related to iron overload may be a health concern for Michigan non-Hispanic Caucasians. Additional studies of penetrance for the C282Y allele are required to fully understand the impact of this information.	16113534
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased C282Y heterozygosity in gestational diabetes.	Fetal diagnosis and therapy		2.7	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism that is characterized by excess accumulation of iron in various organs and often leads to diabetes mellitus (DM). To study whether mutations in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) could be a risk factor for the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), the prevalence of HFE mutations in patients with GDM was compared to that of healthy pregnant controls. GDM was diagnosed in 208 of 2,421 pregnant woman screened between the 24th and 28th week of gestation over a period of 18 months. Patients and 170 matched control subjects were screened for the HFE gene mutations C282Y and H63D. In North and Central European GDM patients, the allele frequency of the C282Y mutation (7.7%) was higher than in pregnant controls (2.9%; p = 0.04), while the frequency of the H63D mutation was not different (p = 0.45). Three patients with GDM were homozygous for H63D (3.1%), 1 patient was homozygous for C282Y (1.0%), 2 patients were compound heterozygous (2.0%) and 26 were heterozygous [11 C282Y (11.2%) and 15 H63D (15.3%)]. C282Y and H63D allele frequencies were not different between controls and GDM patients of Southern European or non-European origin. Irrespective of the HFE-mutation status, serum ferritin levels were increased in patients with GDM compared to healthy pregnant controls (p = 0.01), while transferrin saturation was similar in both groups. In North and Central European patients with GDM, the C282Y allele frequency is higher than in healthy pregnant women, suggesting a genetic susceptibility to the development of GDM.	16113552
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The molecular genetics of haemochromatosis.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2005	4.58	The molecular basis of haemochromatosis has proved more complex than expected. After the 1996 identification of the main causative gene HFE and confirmation that most patients were homozygous for the founder C282Y mutation, it became clear that some families were linked to rarer conditions, first named 'non-HFE haemochromatosis'. The genetics of these less common forms was intensively studied between 2000 and 2004, leading to the recognition of haemojuvelin (HJV), hepcidin (HAMP), transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) and ferroportin-related haemochromatosis, and opening the way for novel hypotheses such as those related to digenic modes of inheritance or the involvement of modifier genes. Molecular studies of rare haemochromatosis disorders have contributed to our understanding of iron homeostasis. In turn, recent findings from studies of knockout mice and functional studies have confirmed that HAMP plays a central role in mobilization of iron, shown that HFE, TFR2 and HJV modulate HAMP production according to the body's iron status, and demonstrated that HAMP negatively regulates cellular iron efflux by affecting the ferroportin cell surface availability. These data shed new light on the pathophysiology of all types of haemochromatosis, and offer novel opportunities to comment on phenotypic differences and distinguish mutations.	16132052
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Duodenal Dcytb and hephaestin mRNA expression are not significantly modulated by variations in body iron homeostasis.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	While the upregulation of duodenal cytochrome b (Dcytb) within duodenal enterocytes is reported in patients with iron deficiency, the expression of hephaestin (Hp) remains controversial in altered iron metabolism states, including HFE associated hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). The effect of iron depletion therapy on the expression of these molecules is unclear. This study examines the duodenal expression of these two molecules in HH patients (prior to and following phlebotomy), in patients with iron deficiency (ID) and in healthy controls. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Dcytb and Hp mRNA expression levels were measured in duodenal tissue of C282Y homozygous HH patients, in ID patients negative for the C282Y mutation with a serum ferritin concentration less than 20 mug/l, and in controls negative for C282Y and H63D mutations with normal iron indices. Dcytb and Hp mRNA expression levels were not significantly different in either non-phlebotomized and phlebotomized HH patients or individuals with iron deficiency when compared with controls. There was no significant correlation between the gene expression levels and their respective serum ferritin or TS% values in any of the investigated groups. In HH patients, there was no significant association between gene expression and the degree of hepatic parenchymal siderosis identified by Perl's iron stain. Dcytb and Hp mRNA levels were significantly correlated to each other when all cohorts were analyzed together and separately. These findings demonstrate that the duodenal ferroreductase Dcytb and ferroxidase Hp mRNA expression are not significantly altered by variations in iron homeostasis. The effect of phlebotomy-induced erythropoiesis did not alter either gene transcript mRNA expression.	16137899
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations in Brazilian chronic hemodialysis patients.	Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas	2005	0.5	Patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) have reduced hemoglobin levels, mostly as a result of decreased kidney production of erythropoietin, but the relation between renal insufficiency and the magnitude of hemoglobin reduction has not been well defined. Hereditary hemochromatosis is an inherited disorder of iron metabolism. The importance of the association of hemochromatosis with treatment for anemia among patients with CRI has not been well described. We analyzed the frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene in 201 Brazilian individuals with CRI undergoing hemodialysis. The analysis of the effects of HFE mutations on iron metabolism and anemia with biochemical parameters was possible in 118 patients of this study (hemoglobin, hematocrit, ferritin levels, transferrin saturation, and serum iron). A C282Y heterozygous mutation was found in 7/201 (3.4%) and H63D homozygous and heterozygous mutation were found in 2/201 (1.0%) and 46/201 (22.9%), respectively. The allelic frequencies of the HFE mutations (0.017 for C282Y mutation and 0.124 for H63D mutation) did not differ between patients with CRI and healthy controls. Regarding the biochemical parameters, no differences were observed between HFE heterozygous and mutation-negative patients, although ferritin levels were not higher among patients with the H63D mutation (P = 0.08). From what we observed in our study, C282Y/H63D HFE gene mutations are not related to degrees of anemia or iron stores in CRI patients receiving intravenous iron supplementation (P > 0.10). Nevertheless, the present data suggest that the H63D mutation may have an important function as a modulating factor of iron overload in these patients.	16138214
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Phenotypic expression in detected C282Y homozygous women depends on body mass index.	Journal of hepatology	2005	10.59	In HFE-related haemochromatosis, a large proportion of C282Y homozygotes, especially women, are not detected by phenotypic screening using transferrin saturation. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical and biochemical factors associated with non-expression of the disease as defined as transferrin saturation <45%. The study was performed in 78 (57 women and 21 men) C282Y homozygotes identified through a large-scale screening program conducted on 19,644 French subjects. Biometric, clinical and biochemical variables including those susceptible to influence body iron stores were tested for association with transferrin saturation levels <45%. Non-expression was observed in 26/57 (46%) women and in 5/21 (24%) men. At multivariate analysis, female gender (OR: 16.5, 95%CI 1.8-146.5; P = 0.012), body mass index (OR: 1.21, 95%CI 1.02-1.44; P = 0.027), haemoglobin levels (OR: 0.88, 95%CI 0.81-0.97; P = 0.012) and serum ferritin levels (OR: 0.99, 95%CI 0.98-1.00; P = 0.007) were significantly and independently associated with a non-expressing phenotype. Excess body mass is commonly associated with the lack of phenotypic expression in detected C282Y homozygotes. This should be kept in mind with respect to the design and cost-effectiveness of phenotypic screening programs for haemochromatosis.	16139917
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Low serum transferrin levels in HFE C282Y homozygous subjects are associated with low CD8(+) T lymphocyte numbers.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic iron overload disease, in the majority of cases associated with homozygosity for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. In spite of this genetic homogeneity, there is a great clinical heterogeneity among HH patients. Low CD8(+) lymphocyte numbers have been associated with a more severe expression of iron overload in HH patients, and in experimental models of iron overload. HH patients present low serum transferrin levels. Transferrin is an indispensable resource for lymphopoiesis. Lymphocyte homeostasis follows general ecology rules of population dynamics that involve competition for limiting resources. In the present study, we questioned whether transferrin levels could be associated with the anomalies seen previously in lymphocyte subset numbers in HH patients. Transferrin levels, total and subset T lymphocyte counts were done in 426 apparently healthy subjects genotyped for HFE. All HFE C282Y carriers presented significantly lower serum transferrin levels than the wild type group, a difference that could not be explained solely by the degree of iron overload. Significant differences were also seen in transferrin levels between males and females, with females presenting higher average serum Transferrin levels. In the population of subjects with Transferrin levels lower than 248 mg/dl, a positive correlation was seen between the peripheral CD8(+) lymphocyte numbers and serum transferrin levels (R(2) = 2.41; r = 0.16; P = 0.018). To test the possible limiting resource effect of transferrin, the correlation between transferrin levels and CD8(+) lymphocyte numbers was scrutinized in 34 HH patients, homozygous for the C282Y mutation. In the homozygous males, where the lowest average transferrin levels were seen, another highly significant correlation was observed between Transferrin levels and CD8(+) numbers. This correlation points to a possible role of transferrin as a limiting resource for MHC class I dependent lymphocyte proliferation, an effect that was not observed in C282Y homozygous female patients.	16140024
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical and family studies in genetic hemochromatosis: microsatellite and HFE studies in five atypical families.	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)	1997	0.5	A candidate gene (HFE) has been described for hereditary hemochromatosis on chromosome 6. The study of well-defined atypical hemochromatosis families using genetic markers may increase our understanding of the sensitivity and the specificity of genotyping in hemochromatosis. One hundred and thirteen Canadian families with genetic hemochromatosis were surveyed to find atypical families as possible examples of people with genetic recombinations. All families underwent clinical investigations including iron studies and HLA typing. Each individual was typed at three polymorphic microsatellite loci (D6S105, D6S1260, and D6S299) on chromosome 6. Sixteen subjects were studied for the two missense mutations described for the candidate gene for hemochromatosis (C282Y, H63D). There were eight HLA-identical siblings found in four different families (five men, three women; age range 30-72) with normal transferrin saturation and ferritin levels. There were two patients identified who were homozygous for the C282Y mutation without biochemical evidence of iron overload, and two patients with no evidence of the mutation with significant iron overload. Our conclusions are as follows: 1) finding HLA-identical siblings without iron overload does not confirm a genetic recombination, 2) difficulties in phenotypic definition of disease and the description of new iron overload syndromes that may differ from classical genetic HC cause complicated genetic studies, and 3) finding iron-loaded patients without a C282Y mutation and patients that are homozygous for the C282Y mutation without evidence of iron overload may limit the use of genotyping in population screening for hemochromatosis.	9328324
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A candidate gene for hemochromatosis: frequency of the C282Y and H63D mutations.	Human genetics	1997	5.14	The gene whose alteration causes hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE according to the international nomenclature) was, more than 20 years ago, shown to map to 6p21.3. It has since escaped all efforts to identify it by positional cloning strategies. Quite recently, a gene named HLA-H was reported as being responsible for the disease. Two missense mutations, Cys282Tyr (C282Y) and His63Asp (H63D), were observed, but no proof was produced that the gene described is the hemochromatosis gene. To validate this gene as the actual site of the alteration causing hemochromatosis, we decided to look for the two mutations in 132 unrelated patients from Brittany. Our results indicate that more than 92% of these patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation, and that all 264 chromosomes but 5 carry either mutation. These findings confirm the direct implication of HLA-H in hemochromatosis.	9341868
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: effects of C282Y and H63D mutations on association with beta2-microglobulin, intracellular processing, and cell surface expression of the HFE protein in COS-7 cells.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	1997	9.42	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is the most common autosomal recessive disorder known in humans. A candidate gene for HH called HFE has recently been cloned that encodes a novel member of the major histocompatibility complex class I family. Most HH patients are homozygous for a Cys-282-->Tyr (C282Y) mutation in HFE gene, which has been shown to disrupt interaction with beta2-microglobulin; a second mutation, His-63-->Asp (H63D), is enriched in HH patients who are heterozygous for C282Y mutation. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of the C282Y and H63D mutations on the cellular trafficking and degradation of the HFE protein in transfected COS-7 cells. The results indicate that, while the wild-type and H63D HFE proteins associate with beta2-microglobulin and are expressed on the cell surface of COS-7 cells, these capabilities are lost by the C282Y HFE protein. We present biochemical and immunofluorescence data that indicate that the C282Y mutant protein: (i) is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and middle Golgi compartment, (ii) fails to undergo late Golgi processing, and (iii) is subject to accelerated degradation. The block in intracellular transport, accelerated turnover, and failure of the C282Y protein to be presented normally on the cell surface provide a possible basis for impaired function of this mutant protein in HH.	9356458
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Ethnic differences in the HFE codon 282 (Cys/Tyr) polymorphism.	Human heredity		1.54	Recent studies have shown that hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is likely to be caused by homozygosity for a Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene located 4.5 Mb telomeric to HLA-A. Population studies of this polymorphism are facilitated by the fact that the Cys282Tyr mutation creates a Rsal restriction site. We have studied the codon 282 (Cys/Tyr) polymorphism in different ethnic groups. In agreement with previous observations the Tyr allele appeared to be rare or absent in Asiatic (Indian, Chinese) populations. The highest allele frequency (7.5%) was found in Swedes. Saamis (2%) and Mordvinians (1.8%) had significantly lower frequencies of the Tyr allele. Comparisons with allele frequencies based on prevalence estimates of HH showed some disagreements with the RFLP data, particularly in Finns. The newly described HFE marker provides a new approach to the screening of HH as well as studies of the relationship between the HFE Tyr allele and different disorders including cancer.	9358014
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations in Polish patients with disturbances of iron metabolism: an initial assessment.	International journal of molecular medicine	2005	2.35	Hereditary hemochromatosis is one of the most frequent genetic disorders in Europeans, but its prevalence in Poland is still unknown. The aim of the study was an initial assessment of the prevalence of C282Y and H62D HFE gene mutations and their influence on the course of chronic hepatitis C. Forty-one patients were admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Medical University of Gdansk in 2000-2004 because of chronic liver diseases with accompanying disturbances in iron metabolism. Genetic tests for the C282Y and H63D mutations were performed by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. The HFE gene mutations were confirmed in 24 of 41 (59%) cases with symptoms of chronic liver disease and iron overload, significantly more frequently in HCV-negative patients (12/14 vs. 12/27; chi2=8.28; p=0.05). The C282Y and H63D HFE gene mutations were detected in 16 of 41 (39%) and 9 of 41 (22%) cases, respectively. HCV-negative patients were C282Y carriers significantly more frequently than HCV-positive patients [9/14 vs. 2/27 C282Y homozygotes; 2/14 vs. 3/27 C282Y heterozygotes (p<0.0001)]. The carrier state of the H63D HFE gene mutation was not significantly more frequent in HCV-positive than HCV-negative patients. HCV infection seems to be a negative predictive marker of HFE gene mutations in patients with iron overload. The relationship of H63D HFE gene mutations with chronic hepatitis C and the possible influence of HCV infection on iron metabolism needs further analysis.	16273299
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The significance of haemochromatosis gene mutations in the general population: implications for screening.	Gut	1998	14.92	Haemochromatosis is associated with mutations in the HFE gene but the significance of these mutations in the general population is unknown. To determine the frequency of HFE gene mutations in the general population, their effect on serum iron indexes, and their role in screening for haemochromatosis. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from 1064 randomly selected subjects was analysed for the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene. Serum iron, transferrin saturation, and ferritin were measured and individuals with increased iron indexes were investigated to confirm or exclude a clinical diagnosis of haemochromatosis. Mutations were identified in 409 individuals (38.4%) with heterozygote (carrier) frequencies of 13.2% and 24.3% for the C282Y and H63D mutations respectively. Heterozygosity for either mutation significantly increased serum iron and transferrin saturation but despite a similar trend for ferritin, this was only significant for C282Y homozygotes. Five individuals (0.47%) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, three of whom had haemochromatosis confirmed by liver biopsy (0.28%). The other two C282Y homozygotes would not have been detected by phenotypic screening alone. HFE mutations are present in 38.4% of the population, affect serum iron indexes, and are important determinants of iron status. The population frequency of genetically defined haemochromatosis (C282Y homozygosity) is approximately one in 200 and is higher than the prevalence of clinically apparent haemochromatosis.	9824612
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Non-C282Y familial iron overload: evidence for locus heterogeneity in haemochromatosis.	Journal of medical genetics	1998	5.65	Haemochromatosis (HC) is an autosomal recessive disease with progressive iron overload leading to midlife onset of clinical complications. The causal gene (HFE) maps to 6p, in close linkage with the HLA class I genes. An HFE candidate gene recently identified has two missense mutations (C282Y and H63D) associated with the disease. Here we document the phenotypic and genetic analysis of a nuclear family comprising two sibs with symptomatic and massive iron overload before the age of 25. The disease seemed to be recessively transmitted and fitted the agreed criteria for haemochromatosis, but was neither associated with the C282Y and H63D mutations nor linked with HLA markers. Our data strongly support locus heterogeneity in haemochromatosis by showing evidence that the gene responsible for juvenile haemochromatosis (JH) does not map to 6p. In the absence of clear cut phenotypic distinction from typical haemochromatosis, patients below 30 years of age and C282Y negative should be considered as putative juvenile cases. This has practical implications in genetic counselling and family management.	9832046
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Prevalence of the Cys282Tyr and His63Asp HFE gene mutations in Spanish patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and in controls.	Journal of hepatology	1998	10.59	A mutation (Cys282Tyr) of the HFE gene has recently been reported to be present in most of the patients with hereditary hemochromatosis of Northern European ancestry, but in a lower frequency in Italy. No data are so far available on the prevalence of these mutations in Spain. Therefore, we initiated the present study to determine if the reported Cys282Tyr HFE mutation is also the main cause of hereditary hemochromatosis in Spain. In addition, we investigated the presence of the His63Asp HFE mutation in patients and in controls. Thirty-one hereditary hemochromatosis patients and 485 controls were screened for the Cys282Tyr and the His63Asp mutations, using polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA, followed by digestion with the restriction enzymes Rsa I or Dpn II, respectively, and the separation of the products by electrophoresis. Twenty-seven out of 31 (87.1%) hereditary hemochromatosis patients were homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation. None of the patients was homozygous for the His63Asp mutation, and two patients (6.5%) were compound heterozygous (Cys282Tyr/His63Asp). Only one of 512 (0.2%) controls was homozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation, and 29 (5.7%) were heterozygous. The Cys282Tyr mutation is present with an allelic frequency of 90.3+/-7.5% in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis and 3.0+/-1.1% in controls. Twenty out of 487 (4.1%) controls were His63Asp homozygous, while 171 (35.1%) were heterozygous. The His63Asp mutation is present with an allelic frequency of 21.7+/-2.7% in controls. The high frequency of the Cys282Tyr mutation in hereditary hemochromatosis patients indicates that this mutation is the most common defect associated with hereditary hemochromatosis in Spain. The finding of some patients with the wild genotype at position 282 suggests the existence of other changes in the HFE gene or in other loci involved in the disease. We have found one of the highest allelic frequencies reported for the His63Asp mutation in our controls (21.7+/-2.7%).	9833909
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the hemochromatosis gene is associated with increased serum iron, transferrin saturation, and hemoglobin in young women: a protective role against iron deficiency?	Clinical chemistry	1998	7.46	Genetic hemochromatosis (GH) is the most common autosomal-recessive disorder (1 in 300 in populations of Celtic origin). Homozygosity for a C282Y mutation in the hemochromatosis (HFE) gene is the underlying defect in approximately 80% of patients with GH, and 3. 2-13% of Caucasians are heterozygous for this gene alteration. Because the high frequency of this mutation may result from a selection advantage, the hypothesis was tested that the C282Y mutation confers protection against iron deficiency in young women. To address this question the genotype of codon 282 was determined in a cohort of 468 unrelated female healthcare workers, ages 18-40 years. In all study participants, a complete blood count was obtained, and erythrocyte distribution width, serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, and ferritin were measured. Two individuals were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, 44 were heterozygous, and 416 were homozygous for the wild-type allele. Heterozygous women had significantly higher values for hemoglobin (P = 0.006), serum iron (P = 0.013), and transferrin saturation (P = 0. 006) than women homozygous for the wild-type allele. Our data provide evidence for a protective role of the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene against iron deficiency in young women and suggest that a more efficient utilization of nutritional iron may have contributed to the high prevalence of the mutation in Caucasian populations.	9836708
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Evaluation and interpretation of iron in the liver.	Seminars in diagnostic pathology	1998	1.96	Faced with hepatic siderosis, the pathologist must (1) determine the parenchymal, mesenchymal, or mixed type of iron overload; (2) quantify liver iron by either histology or biochemistry; (3) seek for associated iron-related lesions, especially sideronecrosis, fibrosis, and iron-free-foci; and (4) assess any other liver damage. The discovery of the HFE gene has modified the management of hemochromatosis. Because homozygosity for the C282Y mutation is diagnostic of the condition regardless of the liver iron concentration-to-age ratio, indication for liver biopsy in C282Y homozygotes is restricted to the assessment of prognostic lesions, such as fibrosis and iron-free-foci. In patients with a phenotype compatible with hemochromatosis but nonhomozygous for the C282Y mutation, liver biopsy remains mandatory to assess nonhemochromatosis causes of iron overload (rare hereditary defects of iron metabolism and transport and iron overload secondary to polymetabolic syndrome, to porphyria cutanea tarda, or to cirrhosis). The evaluation of iron distribution within liver cells and throughout lobules and the assessment of associated lesions are the most important features that allow for correct classification of nonhemochromatosis iron-overload syndromes.	9845425

Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiologia clinica	2008	1.53	Several pharmacogenetics studies have analyzed the influence of specific genetic polymorphisms on the toxicity of antiretroviral treatment. The present review describes some of the adverse effects of antiretroviral drugs in which a genetic predisposition may be involved: efavirenz-induced neurological toxicity, generally associated with the 516G>T polymorphism of liver enzyme cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6); hypersensitivity reactions to nevirapine, associated with specific alleles of major histocompatibility complex, mainly the HLA-DRB1*0101 allele, which, in combination with a high CD4 lymphocyte count, has been associated with systemic reactions and hepatitis in Caucasians, and the HLA-Cw8 allele, which is associated with hypersensitivity reactions in persons from the Italian island of Sardinia and from Japan; nevirapine-induced hepatotoxicity associated with the C>T polymorphism in position 3435T of the ABCB1 (MDR-1) gene codifying for glycoprotein P (lower risk); hyperbilirubinemia in patients exposed to atazanavir or indinavir carrying the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism; peripheral neuropathy with nucleoside analogues associated with haplogroup T of the mitochondrial genome (higher risk) and with the HFE C282Y genotype of the hemochromatosis gene (lower risk); the mutation in codon 964 (R964C) of the POLG gene that codifies the mitochondrial polymerase DNA gamma described in a Thai patient with lactic acidosis; the ABCC2 gene haplotypes associated with tenofovir-induced proximal tubulopathy, and the risk of pancreatitis in persons with mutations in the CFTR and SPINK-1 genes.	18680693
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene mutations, serum ferritin level, transferrin saturation, and their clinical correlates in a Korean population.	Digestive diseases and sciences	2009	2.52	The aim of this study was to investigate HFE gene mutations, blood iron indices, and their clinical correlates in a Korean population. In 484 prospectively enrolled health-check examinees, HFE gene mutations and iron indices with clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed. Although neither the C282Y nor S65C gene mutation were found, the H63D heterozygote was detected in 41 subjects (8.5%). The mean serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TS) were 136.2 +/- 129.8 microg/dl and 39.2 +/- 15.7%, respectively. The H63D genotype was not significantly associated with iron indices. High serum ferritin was associated with old age, the male gender, high body mass index (BMI), and the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). High TS was associated with the male gender and alcohol drinking. HFE gene mutation is rare; however, TS seems to be higher in Koreans compared to Caucasians or other ethnic groups. Serum ferritin reflects iron store as well as the presence of NAFLD.	18683048
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Serum transferrin saturation increase is associated with decrease of antibacterial activity of serum in patients with HFE-related genetic hemochromatosis.	The American journal of gastroenterology	2008	0.5	Patients with type 1 (HFE-related) genetic hemochromatosis are usually excluded from blood donation on the basis that this disease may facilitate bacterial infections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the serum antibacterial effect against Salmonella enterica Typhimurium LT2 in relation to iron status. Serum samples were collected in 26 iron-overloaded (homozygous C282Y mutation) and 35 iron-depleted hemochromatosis patients and 33 healthy control subjects. The antibacterial activity of sera and iron parameters were tested for each patient. Serum from normal controls had an antibacterial effect against Salmonella Typhimurium LT2. The antibacterial effect decreased from the 1:2 to the 1:8 dilution and was always significantly lower in the iron-overloaded group. In both control and iron-depleted patients, a positive correlation was found between the decrease of antibacterial effect and the increase of both serum iron and transferrin saturation. These results (a) support the view that chronic iron overload decreases serum antibacterial effect against Salmonella enterica Typhimurium LT2, (b) favor the interest of including, besides serum ferritinemia, serum transferrin saturation levels as a further criterion for iron-depletive treatment efficacy, and (c) provide an argument for not discouraging the use of blood from iron-depleted hemochromatosis patients for transfusion.	18684194
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis: missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis?	The American journal of medicine	2013	0.5	"""Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that can cause iron overload and organ damage. Hereditary hemochromatosis is characterized by mutations in the HFE gene. HFE C282Y homozygotes and compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D) are at risk of developing manifestations of hemochromatosis. Abnormal iron study results also occur in many liver and hematologic diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. Pertinent clinical and laboratory data, including HFE genotype, were tabulated from the electronic medical records of patients with the International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision code 275, """"disorders of iron metabolism,"""" who were seen at a tertiary referral center between January 2002 and May 2012. HFE genotyping was obtained in only 373 of 601 patients (62%); 200 were C282Y homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. Of the 173 patients with nonhereditary hemochromatosis genotypes, 53% were misdiagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis and 38% underwent phlebotomy. In two thirds of these cases, the misdiagnosis was made by a nonspecialist. In the remaining 228 patients who were not genotyped, 80 were diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis and 64 were phlebotomized. Of patients misdiagnosed with hemochromatosis, 68% had known liver disease and 5% had a hematologic cause of abnormal iron study results. Abnormal iron study results in patients with nonhereditary hemochromatosis genotypes commonly lead to a misdiagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis and inappropriate treatment with phlebotomy. This error often is seen in the setting of elevated iron study results secondary to chronic liver diseases. Furthermore, hereditary hemochromatosis is commonly diagnosed and treated without HFE genotyping. We suggest that phlebotomy centers require a documented HFE genotype before initiating phlebotomy."""	24054178
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	TFR2-related hereditary hemochromatosis as a frequent cause of primary iron overload in patients from Central-Southern Italy.	Blood cells, molecules & diseases		0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common Mendelian disorder of iron metabolism. Eighty percent of northern Europeans descendant HH patients carry the same mutation (p.C282Y) in the HFE gene. Simultaneously, due to a founder effect, its frequency varies considerably between different populations. In Central-Southern Italy the prevalence of p.C282Y mutation is low and in several patients the disease has different causes. Four additional rarer forms have been described. Type 3 HH has been reported in about 50 families and no more than 30 TFR2 pathogenic mutations have been globally identified. The aim of this study is to assess the TFR2 role in non-HFE HH pathogenesis. TFR2 sequence analysis was performed on 45 Italian patients without HFE mutations. This study revealed TFR2 biallelic pathogenic mutations in 7/45 (15.6%) individuals. Moreover monoallelic TFR2 deleterious defects (18%) or polymorphisms with unclear meaning (36%) were identified. Besides, we recognized 10 novel variants and 9 described changes. We believe this to be the largest series of type 3 HH patients described so far. Present findings support the hypothesis of a main role of the TFR2 gene in HH pathogenesis in those regions, such as Central-Southern Italy, where the p.C282Y frequency is low.	24055163
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Precipitating factors of porphyria cutanea tarda in Brazil with emphasis on hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations. Study of 60 patients.	Anais brasileiros de dermatologia		0.88	Porphyria cutanea tarda is the most common form of porphyria, characterized by the decreased activity of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme. Several reports associated HFE gene mutations of hereditary hemochromatosis with porphyria cutanea tarda worldwide, although up to date only one study has been conducted in Brazil. Investigation of porphyria cutanea tarda association with C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene. Identification of precipitating factors (hepatitis C, HIV, alcoholism and estrogen) and their link with HFE mutations. An ambispective study of 60 patients with PCT was conducted during the period from 2003 to 2012. Serological tests for hepatitis C and HIV were performed and histories of alcohol abuse and estrogen intake were investigated. HFE mutations were identified with real-time PCR. Porphyria cutanea tarda predominated in males and alcohol abuse was the main precipitating factor. Estrogen intake was the sole precipitating factor present in 25% of female patients. Hepatitis C was present in 41.7%. All HIV-positive patients (15.3%) had a history of alcohol abuse. Allele frequency for HFE mutations, i.e., C282Y (p = 0.0001) and H63D (p = 0.0004), were significantly higher in porphyria cutanea tarda patients, compared to control group. HFE mutations had no association with the other precipitating factors. Alcohol abuse, hepatitis C and estrogen intake are prevalent precipitating factors in our porphyria cutanea tarda population; however, hemochromatosis in itself can also contribute to the outbreak of porphyria cutanea tarda, which makes the research for HFE mutations necessary in these patients.	24068123
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Increased capacity of lymphocytes from hereditary hemochromatosis patients homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation to respond to the genotoxic effect of diepoxybutane.	Mutation research	2009	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by systemic iron overload with consequent tissue damage. The vast majority of HH patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in HFE, a non-classical MHC class-I gene located in chromosome 6, whose role in the regulation of systemic iron metabolism is still not completely understood. Iron enhances the formation of reactive oxygen species, with increasing risk of DNA damage induced by oxidative stress, and consequently an increased susceptibility to chromosome instability. In the present work we examined spontaneous and diepoxybutane (DEB)-induced chromosome instability in PHA-stimulated lymphocyte cultures from 23 HH patients, all homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation, in comparison to 29 normal controls. In addition, three patients with secondary forms of iron overload, not related to HFE, were studied as controls to test the role of iron overload on DEB-induced chromosome instability. Our results show a significantly higher frequency of spontaneous chromosome breaks in lymphocytes from the HH patients, when compared with lymphocytes from normal controls (p<0.0001). In addition, there is a significant correlation between the percentage of cells with spontaneous chromosomal breaks and the transferrin saturation (r=0.53, p=0.0041) or serum-ferritin levels (r=0.66, p=0.0001) in patients. Surprisingly, the frequency of DEB-induced chromosome breaks was significantly lower in lymphocytes from HH patients than in lymphocytes from both controls and patients with secondary forms of hemochromatosis (p=0.0029). No correlation was observed between the percentage of cells with DEB-induced chromosome breaks and the transferrin saturation or serum-ferritin values. These results suggest that lymphocytes from HH patients may have an increased capacity to respond to DEB-induced chromosome breakage, and that this capacity is somehow related to the presence of the C282Y HFE mutation.	19146986
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Iron binding saturation and genotypic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis in patients with liver disease.	American journal of clinical pathology	2006	2.28	We compared the results of HFE genotype with tests for iron binding saturation (IBS) in 190 consecutive patients with liver disease using 2 IBS cutoff levels: 45% and 60%. Saturation was more than 45% in 117 patients (61.6%) and more than 60% in 89 (46.8%). The number of patients (10) with the highest-risk HFE genotype (C282Y homozygote) was higher than expected. Elevated IBS cannot be used to predict genotype. There was a modest association of C282Y homozygosity with increased IBS (7 of 10, saturation >45% and 6 of 10, >60%). There was poor correlation of elevated saturation with other genotypes containing 1 or more HFE variants. Patients with a wild-type genotype (lacking HFE variants) and elevated IBS were far more likely to have an iron binding capacity less than 250 microg/dL (<44.8 micromol/L) than those with saturation values less than 45%, suggesting that a significant percentage of elevated IBS test results in liver disease are false-positives associated with decreased synthetic capacity. Nevertheless, an appreciable number of patients with elevated IBS had normal iron binding capacity, indicating the complexity of relationships among iron absorption and binding, disease status, HFE genotype, and other potential modifying factors in liver disease.	16393683
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE genotypes and dietary heme iron: no evidence of strong gene-nutrient interaction on serum ferritin concentrations in middle-aged women.	Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD	2006	3.39	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a disorder characterized by inappropriately high intestinal iron absorption. In populations of Northern European descent, HH is most commonly caused by mutations (C282Y/H63D) in the HFE gene. We investigated the effects of dietary heme iron intake and HFE mutations on serum ferritin concentrations in a population-based random sample of 1611 women aged >50 years using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Higher heme iron intake was associated with significantly higher serum ferritin concentrations (P(trend) < 0.001). Also, women with the compound or C282Y homozygous genotype had significantly higher serum ferritin concentrations (geometric mean 115.2 microg/L (95% CI 81.4-162.9 microg/L) than women carrying normal alleles (geometric mean 76.6 microg/L (95% CI 72.5-80.9 microg/L). We observed the highest serum ferritin concentrations among postmenopausal women who are compound heterozygous or C282Y homozygous, and who consume relatively high amounts of heme iron (geometric mean 183.9 microg/L (95% CI 97.2-347.8 microg/L). Even when there are currently no clinical signs, women with the compound or C282Y homozygous genotype may still be at risk for developing iron overload sometime after menopause.	16399493
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE H63D polymorphism as a modifier of the effect of cumulative lead exposure on pulse pressure: the Normative Aging Study.	Environmental health perspectives	2010	8.44	Cumulative lead exposure is associated with a widened pulse pressure (PP; the -difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure), a marker of arterial stiffness and a predictor of cardiovascular disease. Polymorphisms in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) have been shown to modify the impact of cumulative lead exposure on measures of adult cognition and cardiac function. We examined whether the HFE mutations modify the impact of lead on PP in -community-dwelling older men. We examined 619 participants with a total of 1,148 observations of PP from a substudy of bone lead levels (a measure of cumulative exposure, measured by in vivo K-shell X-ray fluorescence) and health in the Normative Aging Study between 1991 and 2001. Linear mixed-effects regression models with random intercepts were constructed. Of the 619 subjects, 138 and 72 carried the HFE H63D and C282Y variants, respectively. After adjusting for age; education; alcohol intake; smoking; daily intakes of calcium, sodium, and potassium; total calories; family history of hypertension; diabetes; height; heart rate; high-density lipoprotein (HDL); total cholesterol:HDL ratio; and waist circumference, baseline bone lead levels were associated with steeper increases in PP in men with at least one H63D allele (p-interaction = 0.03 for tibia and 0.02 for patella) compared with men with only the wild types or C282Y variant. The HFE H63D polymorphism, but not the C282Y mutation, appears to enhance susceptibility to the deleterious impact of cumulative lead on PP, possibly via prooxidative or pro-inflammatory mechanisms.	20478760
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and HFE gene mutations: a Polish study.	World journal of gastroenterology	2010	2.79	To describe a Polish population with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with regard to HFE gene mutations, as well as analyzing demographic and clinical data. Sixty-two consecutive patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were included in the study. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were summarized in a database. C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment lenght polymorphism. The analyzed cohort consisted of 62 homogeneic Caucasian participants, 66.1% men and 33.9% women, with a median age of 48 years. The median body mass index was 29.05 kg/m(2). Hypercholesterolemia was observed in 74.2% of patients and hypertriglyceridemia in 32.2%; 16.1% had type 2 diabetes mellitus (DMt2). On liver biopsy, 22.6% of NAFLD patients were found to have severe fibrosis. There were no differences between frequencies of HFE gene mutations in subgroups of NAFLD patients with less and more severe liver fibrosis. Obesity, older age, female gender and DMt2 were associated with more advanced fibrosis in this Polish cohort, as well as higher glucose level, serum iron and transaminase aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio. HFE mutations conferred no additional hepatic fibrosis risk in NAFLD, but higher serum iron was a risk factor for severe liver damage in NAFLD, regardless of HFE mutations.	20503453
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Screening for C282Y homozygosity in a Norwegian population (HUNT2): The sensitivity and specificity of transferrin saturation.	Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation	2010	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic condition characterized by increased iron absorption. Most HH cases are homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene, but accurate prevalence data for the Norwegian population is lacking. In population studies, serum transferrin saturation (TS) is commonly used as a screening test. However, the sensitivity and specificity of TS in this setting is not well documented. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of the C282Y mutation in the general population, and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the TS test as a screening criterion for finding C282Y homozygotes. The hemochromatosis screening study in Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway (the HUNT2 study) comprised 65,238 participants. The HUNT biobank contains biological material and data from the participants, and 5000 individuals were randomly selected. Genotyping of the common HFE gene mutations was successful for 4827 samples, from which TS data existed for 4804 individuals. From these data we calculated the population frequency of the C282Y mutation, and the sensitivity and specificity of TS measurements. The prevalence of C282Y homozygosity in the population was 0.75%. Using 55% (men) and 50% (women) as decision limits, the sensitivity of two consecutive elevated TS measurements was 90.0% for men and 55.0% for women, whereas the specificity was 99.6% and 99.4%, respectively. An unbiased estimate of the C282Y homozygote prevalence in Norway is 0.75%. Two measurements of TS is an accurate screening test for C282Y homozygosity in men, but not in women.	20073670
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequencies of C282Y and H63D alleles in the HFE gene among various Jewish ethnic groups in Israel: a change of concept required.	Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics	2010	7.71	Hereditary hemochromatosis has not been fully evaluated in the non-Ashkenazi population and is considered to be relatively rare. After ascertaining three unrelated hereditary hemochromatosis families of North African Jewish origin with the HFE C282Y/C282Y genotype, we evaluated the C282Y and H63D allele frequencies among the different Jewish ethnic groups in Israel, in particular North African Jews. Data were collected from three Israeli Medical Centers. North African, Oriental, Yemenite, and Sephardic Jewish healthy individuals were assessed for the C282Y and H63D alleles. The C282Y allele frequency was 1.02% (6/586 chromosomes), and the H63D allele frequency was 13.82% (81/586 chromosomes) in the North African Jewish group. The C282Y allele was not detected in the other non-Ashkenazi groups. The H63D allele frequency was 12.5% (38/304 chromosomes) in Oriental Jews, 14.9% (14/94 chromosomes) in Yemenite Jews, and 9.3% (11/118 chromosomes) in Sephardic Jews. Hereditary hemochromatosis is underrecognized among North African Jews, who have carrier frequencies of 1/58 and 1/4 for C282Y and H63D, respectively. HFE-hereditary hemochromatosis is not rare among this population as currently thought and merits increased awareness to prevent endpoint disease. The frequent occurrence of beta-thalassemia trait and HFE-H63D in non-Ashkenazi Jews raises the possibility of genetic interactions contributing to iron overload when coinherited and requires further evaluation.	20084012
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Liver iron deposits in hepatitis B patients: association with severity of liver disease but not with hemochromatosis gene mutations.	Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology	2004	3.32	Iron deposits in the liver and abnormalities in serum iron biochemistry are frequently observed in patients with chronic liver diseases, but data for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection are scarce. Moreover, the role of HFE mutations in iron deposits in this condition remains unknown. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of serum iron biochemical abnormalities and iron deposits in the liver of chronic HBV patients, and to evaluate the consequences for the activity and severity of liver disease. Additionally, we studied the role of HFE gene mutations in iron deposits. Eighty-one male non-cirrhotic HBV patients were studied. Serum iron biochemistry, liver enzymes and C282Y/H63D mutations were investigated. Liver biopsies were scored for necroinflammatory activity (histological activity index [HAI]), fibrosis and iron deposits. Elevated transferrin saturation (TS) was found in 27.1% of patients and liver iron deposits in 48.7%; these deposits were mild in 68.4% and moderate in 31.6%. Patients with liver iron deposits exhibited significantly higher scores for HAI and fibrosis than those without iron deposits. HFE mutations were identified in 23.4% of patients (14 H63D heterozygotes, four H63D homozygotes, one compound mutation). No difference in the prevalence of C282Y and H63D mutations was observed between HBV patients (1.2% and 23.4%, respectively) and the general population (4.1% and 27.8%, respectively). No association was detected between HFE mutations and elevated TS or liver iron deposits. Elevated TS and liver iron deposits were frequent in non-cirrhotic HBV patients. Iron deposits were mainly mild and associated with higher activity and severity of liver disease, but not with HFE mutations.	15304122
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Clinical expression of haemochromatosis in Irish C282Y homozygotes identified through family screening.	European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology	2004	2.09	In Ireland, the homozygote frequency of the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene is 1/83. The biochemical expression of this mutation is high in haemochromatosis (HH) individuals identified through family screening, but the clinical expression of the mutation in Irish HH subjects to date has not been investigated fully. To determine the clinical, biochemical and histological penetrance of the C282Y mutation in Irish C282Y homozygotes identified through family screening. Two hundred and nine C282Y homozygous individuals comprising of 172 first-degree relatives, 31 second-degree relatives and four unrelated individuals were identified following HFE mutation analysis of 167 families. The following variables were analysed: age at identification, gender, fasting transferrin saturation, fasting serum ferritin, liver enzymes, clinical symptomatology, liver histopathology and histochemical iron staining. An elevated transferrin saturation in combination with an elevated ferritin was present in 43.4% of males and 23.3% of females. Abnormal liver enzymes were found in 32.3% of males. Diabetes, a haemochromatosis-specific association, was noted in 2.8% of males. Of those individuals requiring liver histopathology evaluation, 38% had moderate-to-severe iron staining, and 42% had fibrosis; 2.8% of the biopsied cohort had cirrhosis. Thus, HH cirrhotics were identified in less than 1% of the screened population. Although the homozygote frequency in Ireland is very high, the prevalence of advanced liver disease was less than 1% of the family members screened. Nevertheless, 42% of biopsied patients had histological evidence of iron overload-related architectural change and 2.8% had cirrhosis. This cohort of young people had previously unrecognized biochemical iron overload and histopathological change. This emphasizes the importance and value of both genetic and biochemical screening in first-degree relatives of identified homozygotes.	15316409
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Frequency of HFE mutations among Turkish blood donors according to transferrin saturation: genotype screening for hereditary hemochromatosis among voluntary blood donors in Turkey.	Journal of clinical gastroenterology	2004	3.16	The C282Y and H63D mutations of HFE gene are associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), the most common autosomal recessive disorder in European population. This is the first Turkish population study of, the prevalence of these mutations. 2677 healthy volunteer blood donors were screened by means of transferrin saturation (TS) with the cutoff value of 45. As study group, 86 donors with a TS 45 or higher and as control group 57 donors with TS less than 45 were tested for these mutations, ferritin, and alanin aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The mean age of donors were 33+/-9 and 94.1% of them were male. The number of donors with TS 45 or higher was 265 (9.9%). C282Y mutation was not detected. The frequency of H63D mutation in the study, control and general groups were 27.32%, 21.05%, and 24.83%, respectively. As a result, the H63D mutation was present in 60 out of 143 participants in whom 49 were heterozygote (frequency of heterozygote allele 49/286 = 17.13%), 11 were homozygote (frequency of homozygote allele 22/286 = 7.69%). Serum ALT and TS were not affected from the type of H63D mutation. There was no difference in ferritin levels according to type of H63D mutations among 143 blood donors. This study revealed the absence of C282Y mutation in our population. Although the frequency of H63D heterozygosity seems to be higher than the other population, the genetic screening for the HFE gene mutation is inadequate and the phenotypic screening with TS and ferritin seems to be preferable in Turkish population.	15319650
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A previously undescribed frameshift deletion mutation of HFE (c.del277; G93fs) associated with hemochromatosis and iron overload in a C282Y heterozygote.	Clinical genetics	2004	3.89	A 62-year-old white man with a hemochromatosis phenotype was found to be heterozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. The H63D and S65C mutations of HFE were not present. As most C282Y heterozygotes do not develop a hemochromatosis phenotype, the coding region of the patient's HFE gene was sequenced and a previously undescribed frameshift mutation was identified in exon 2 (c.del277; G93fs) that resulted in a premature stop-codon. There were no coding region mutations of the ferroportin gene (FPN1). We performed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of the patient and his brother who was heterozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation unassociated with a hemochromatosis phenotype. They shared only C282Y and the HLA haplotype A*03, B*14; hence, the c.del277 mutation was linked to the HLA haplotype A*02, B*44 and therefore not on the same chromosome as the C282Y mutation. Thus, the present patient's only intact HFE protein is C282Y, and this may explain his hemochromatosis phenotype.	15324319
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE gene polymorphisms and the risk for autism in Egyptian children and impact on the effect of oxidative stress.	Disease markers	2011	2.14	Autism is among the commonest neurodevelopmental childhood disorders worldwide; its aetiology is still unknown. Iron metabolism alteration in the central nervous system is recently implicated as a risk factor for several neurodegenerative disorders. Haemochromatosis HFE gene polymorphisms (p.H63D and p.C282Y) have shown significant association with several neurological diseases. Some evidences show altered iron related proteins in serum of autistic children. The aim of this work is to conduct a preliminary pilot study for the association of HFE polymorphisms and autism. All cases were referred from the clinic of special needs, National Research Centre, Cairo. Clinical diagnosis was based on the criteria for autistic disorder as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). Whole genome DNA was extracted; p.H63D and p.C282Y genotyping was studied using specific sequence amplification followed by restriction enzyme digestion on a sample of autism patients (25 cases) and twenty controls. The p.H63D is more abundant than the C282Y among both autism and control samples. No significant association of p.H63D nor p.C282Y polymorphism and autism was revealed. We here report on the first pilot study of the possible genetic association between autism and HFE gene polymorphisms among Egyptians. Although our results do not prove the role of HFE polymorphisms as risk factors for autism, yet this does not exclude the role of iron in this prevalent disorder. Further extended studies are recommended to include other iron metabolism genes.	22048270
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Detection of soluble HFE associated with soluble transferrin receptor in human serum.	International journal of molecular medicine	2011	2.35	Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease, and 80-90% of patients exhibit Cys282Tyr or His63Asp mutations in the HFE gene. HFE, also known as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like molecule, binds to transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and β2-microglobulin at the cell surface, forming a complex. Some MHC class I molecules are known to be soluble, raising the possibility that HFE also has a soluble form. However, it is not known whether soluble HFE (sHFE) is present in human serum, and there has been no report on the possible binding between sHFE and soluble TfR (sTfR), which is the fragment of the extracellular domain of TfR1 released into the blood. In the present study, we purified an sTfR complex from pooled serum collected from healthy volunteers, showing that the main components of the complex are sTfR and transferrin. We also confirmed the existence of sHFE in this complex. This is the first report on the existence of sHFE in human serum.	21165552
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	A time course of hepcidin response to iron challenge in patients with HFE and TFR2 hemochromatosis.	Haematologica	2011	6.67	Inadequate hepcidin production leads to iron overload in nearly all types of hemochromatosis. We explored the acute response of hepcidin to iron challenge in 25 patients with HFE-hemochromatosis, in two with TFR2-hemochromatosis and in 13 controls. Sixteen patients (10 C282Y/C282Y homozygotes, 6 C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes) had increased iron stores, while nine (6 C282Y/C282Y homozygotes, 3 C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes) were studied after phlebotomy-induced normalization of iron stores. We analyzed serum iron, transferrin saturation, and serum hepcidin by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and mass-spectrometry at baseline, and 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after a single 65-mg dose of oral iron. Serum iron and transferrin saturation significantly increased at 4 hours and returned to baseline values at 8-12 hours in all groups, except in the iron-normalized patients who showed the highest and longest increase of both parameters. The level of hepcidin increased significantly at 4 hours and returned to baseline at 24 hours in controls and in the C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes at diagnosis. The hepcidin response was smaller in C282Y-homozygotes than in controls, barely detectable in the patients with iron-depleted HFE-hemochromatosis and absent in those with TFR2-hemochromatosis. Conclusions Our results are consistent with a scenario in which TFR2 plays a prominent and HFE a contributory role in the hepcidin response to a dose of oral iron. In iron-normalized patients with HFE hemochromatosis, both the low baseline hepcidin level and the weak response to iron contribute to hyperabsorption of iron.	21173098
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis of tongue.	Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology, oral radiology, and endodontics	2011	0.5	Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) refers to several inherited disorders of iron metabolism leading to tissue iron overload. Classical HH is associated with mutations in HFE (C282Y homozygotes or C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes) and is almost exclusively found in populations of northern European descent. Non-HFE-associated HH is caused by mutations in other recently identified genes involved in iron metabolism. Hepcidin is an iron regulatory hormone that inhibits ferroportin-mediated iron export from enterocytes and macrophages. Defective hepcidin gene expression or function may underlie most forms of HH. Target organs and tissues affected by HH include the liver, heart, pancreas, joints, and skin, with cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus representing late signs of disease in patients with markedly elevated liver iron concentration. Recently, we have encountered the rare representation of this disease of the oral cavity associated with generalized burning sensation of the tongue. The diagnosis was established accidently, from the lab investigations, otherwise the patient was healthy and free from classical signs and symptoms of the disease. The patient was adequately treated by phlebotomy. To conclude, all patients with a chief complaint of burning sensation of the oral cavity and tongue should be adequately screened for hereditary hemochromatosis to prevent the associated mortality and morbidity with the hemochromatosis.	21176807
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	HFE polymorphisms influence the response to chemotherapeutic agents via induction of p16INK4A.	International journal of cancer	2011	5.53	HFE is a protein that impacts cellular iron uptake. HFE gene variants are identified as risk factors or modifiers for multiple diseases. Using HFE stably transfected human neuroblastoma cells, we found that cells carrying the C282Y HFE variant do not differentiate when exposed to retinoic acid. Therefore, we hypothesized HFE variants would impact response to therapeutic agents. Both the human neuroblastoma and glioma cells that express the C282Y HFE variant are resistant to Temodar, geldanamycin and γ-radiation. A gene array analysis revealed that p16INK4A (p16) expression was increased in association with C282Y expression. Decreasing p16 protein by siRNA resulted in increased vulnerability to all of the therapeutic agents suggesting that p16 is responsible for the resistance. Decreasing HFE expression by siRNA resulted in a 85% decrease in p16 expression in the neuroblastoma cells but not the astrocytoma cells. These data suggest a potential direct relationship between HFE and p16 that may be cell specific or mediated by different pathways in the different cell types. In conclusion, the C282Y HFE variant impacts the vulnerability of cancer cells to current treatment strategies apparently by increasing expression of p16. Although best known as a tumor suppressor, there are multiple reports that p16 is elevated in some forms of cancer. Given the frequency of the HFE gene variants, as high as 10% of the Caucasian population, these data provide compelling evidence that the C282Y HFE variant should be part of a pharmacogenetic strategy for evaluating treatment efficacy in cancer cells.	21190189
CBS	c.833T>C	p.Ile278Thr	Paradoxical absence of a prothrombotic phenotype in a mouse model of severe hyperhomocysteinemia.	Blood	2012	11.84	Hyperhomocysteinemia confers a high risk for thrombotic vascular events, but homocysteine-lowering therapies have been ineffective in reducing the incidence of secondary vascular outcomes, raising questions regarding the role of homocysteine as a mediator of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, to determine the contribution of elevated homocysteine to thrombosis susceptibility, we studied Cbs(-/-) mice conditionally expressing a zinc-inducible mutated human CBS (I278T) transgene. Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice exhibited severe hyperhomocysteinemia and endothelial dysfunction in cerebral arterioles. Surprisingly, however, these mice did not display increased susceptibility to arterial or venous thrombosis as measured by photochemical injury in the carotid artery, chemical injury in the carotid artery or mesenteric arterioles, or ligation of the inferior vena cava. A survey of hemostatic and hemodynamic parameters revealed no detectible differences between control and Tg-I278T Cbs(-/-) mice. Our data demonstrate that severe elevation in homocysteine leads to the development of vascular endothelial dysfunction but is not sufficient to promote thrombosis. These findings may provide insights into the failure of homocysteine-lowering trials in secondary prevention from thrombotic vascular events.	22186991
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	C282Y and H63D mutation frequencies in a population from central Spain.	Disease markers	2001	2.14	To determine the frequency of hereditary hemochromatosis gene mutations, C282Y and H63D, from 125 autochthonous blood donors originating from a Central region of Spain, to provide epidemiological data about HFE gene in the Iberian Peninsula. DNA extracted from blood samples was analyzed by PCR-RFLP. Restriction enzymes were Snab I and Bcl I for C282Y and H63D, respectively. Results were visualized with Ethidium Bromide staining after gel electrophoresis. C282Y frequency was 0.02 and that of H63D was 0.16. Result for C282Y mutation falls within the range of variation of the Mediterranean populations. H63D frequency agrees with those reported for other European populations. In both cases frequencies obtained are the lowest of compared Spanish data. This study is useful to compare expected versus presented C282Y and H63D frequencies in Spanish populations and to contribute to the knowledge of Spanish variability, rarely analyzed until now for HFE gene mutations.	11673657
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	An unusual melting curve profile in LightCycler multiplex genotyping of the hemochromatosis H63D/C282Y gene mutations.	Clinical biochemistry	2001	2.38	Real time polymerase chain reaction followed by melting curve analysis using hybridization probes has become an important tool in routine diagnosis of the HFE mutations, which are associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. We used the LightCycler technology for simultaneous detection of the H63D and C282Y mutations of the HFE gene in patients with a higher prevalence for hemochromatosis. In our cohort we identified two siblings with a variant pattern of the HFE-LightCycler melting profiles preventing allelic discrimination. As a consequence, in these patients DNA sequencing or RFLP analysis is necessary to unequivocally assign the correct HFE genotype.	11676983
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	The frequency of C282Y and H63D mutations in Hemochromatosis gene in native Estonians.	European journal of epidemiology	2001	7.11	Four hundred and forty two adult individuals of Estonian nationality were examined in different regions of Estonia for the C282Y and H63D HFE mutations to determine the allele and genotype frequencies. The sample consisted only of those people whose at least four grandparents were born in Estonia, and have lived settled in the same region. The study was carried out using the PCR technique and restriction analysis for C282Y and H63D mutations respectively. For the C282Y mutation the frequency of heterozygotes was 6.6% and homozygotes 0.2%, giving allele frequency 0.035. The allele frequency for the H63D mutation was 0.136, and the frequency of homo- and hetero-zygotes 1.6% and 24.0% respectively.	11680538
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Mutation analysis of the HFE gene in German hemochromatosis patients and controls using automated SSCP-based capillary electrophoresis and a new PCR-ELISA technique.	Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology	2001	2.2	The diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) before the onset of iron-overload has been difficult in the past. However, a convincing candidate gene for HH: HFE has been described recently. The aims of this study were: 1) To determine the prevalence of the hemochromatosis associated mutations C282Y and H63D of the HFE gene in patients from Southern Germany with hemochromatosis phenotype; and 2) to test two new, time- and cost-saving methods: automated SSCP-based capillary electrophoresis (SSCP-CE) and a PCR-ELISA technique for the analysis of HFE mutations. HFE genotype was studied in 36 unrelated HH patients and 126 controls from Southern Germany. In addition, family screening was performed in 76 relatives. The C282Y and H63D mutations were detected using SSCP-CE and restriction length polymorphism (RFLP). The C282Y mutation was additionally analysed by a PCR-ELISA. Twenty-six (72%) HH patients were homozygous for mutation C282Y, and three compound heterozygous for C282Y and H63D. One patient was homozygous for H63D. By performing family screening, six additional patients with the +/+ C282Y mutation were identified. The results of the SSCP-CE and the PCR-ELISA analysis agreed completely with data obtained by RFLP. SSCP-CE and PCR-ELISA analysis proved to be reliable methods for HFE genotyping and therefore represent cost- and time-effective alternative methods to the widely used restriction analysis allowing large populations to be screened for HH associated with HFE mutations. Surprisingly, only 72% of our HH patients had the C282Y +/+ genotype. This indicates that hemochromatosis in Southern Germany is genetically more heterogeneous than in other regions. A challenge for the future will be to define the genetic or environmental factors responsible for iron-overload in HH patients who do not show typical alterations of the HFE gene.	11686223
HFE	c.845G>A	p.Cys282Tyr	Hereditary hemochromatosis masquerading as rheumatoid arthritis.	Annali italiani di medicina interna : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di medicina interna		0.5	Early erroneous diagnosis of rheumatic disease is common in subjects with arthropathy due to hereditary hemochromatosis. A 71-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and monoclonal gammopathy underwent hip replacement and was referred to our Department because of altered liver function tests. Test results were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C virus, and positive for rheumatoid factor. A diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis had been made on the basis of compatible joint involvement and laboratory data and steroid treatment prescribed. Since his serum ferritin was 3249 ng/mL, genetic testing for hereditary hemochromatosis was carried out and revealed homozygosity for Cys282Tyr mutation in the HFE gene. Liver biopsy disclosed cirrhosis compatible with hemochromatosis. Following a review of the patients' radiographs, the diagnosis of hemochromatosis arthropathy was made. Phlebotomies and family screening for hereditary hemochromatosis were done. The most logical explanation for the positive rheumatoid factor result in this subject are his age and the presence of two chronic diseases involving long-standing antigenic stimulation and monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance. It is important to distinguish rheumatoid arthritis from hemochromatosis arthropathy for several reasons: patients with hereditary hemochromatosis do not require corticosteroid treatment; in case of erroneous diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, phlebotomy is not started early, and familial genetic counseling is not considered. In male subjects with positive rheumatoid factor and joint and liver disease, hereditary hemochromatosis should be considered. More liberal use of genetic testing is justified in such cases.	11688350
